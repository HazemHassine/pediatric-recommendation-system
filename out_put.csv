23,The Neonatal History,The Newborn Infant ,850,"THE NEONATAL HISTORY The newborn medical history has three key components: (1) maternal and paternal medical and genetic history, (2) maternal past obstetric history, and (3) current antepar- tum and intrapartum obstetric history. The mother’s medical history includes chronic medical conditions, medications taken during pregnancy, unusual dietary habits, smoking history, occupational exposure to chemicals or infections of potential risk to the fetus, and any social history that might increase the risk for parenting prob- lems and child abuse. Family illnesses with genetic implica- tions should be sought. The past obstetric history includes maternal age, gravidity, parity, blood type, and pregnancy outcomes. The current obstetric history includes the results of procedures during the current pregnancy such as ultrasound, amniocentesis, screening tests (rubella antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, serum quadruple screen for genetic disorders, HIV), and antepartum tests of fetal well-being (eg, biophysical profiles, nonstress tests, or Doppler assessment of fetal blood flow patterns). Pregnancy-related maternal complications such as urinary tract infection, pregnancy-induced hyperten- sion, eclampsia, gestational diabetes, vaginal bleeding, and preterm labor should be documented. Significant peripartum events include duration of ruptured membranes, maternal fever, fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), anesthesia and analgesia used, reason for operative or forceps delivery, infant status at birth, resuscitative measures, and Apgar scores. ASSESSMENT OF GROWTH  & GESTATIONAL AGE It is important to know the infant’s gestational age because normal behavior and possible medical problems can be predicted on this basis. The date of the last menstrual period is the best indicator of gestational age. Uterine fundal height and early fetal ultrasound provide supporting information. Postnatal physical characteristics and neurologic develop- ment are also clues to gestational age. Table 1–1 lists the physical and neurologic criteria of maturity used to estimate gestational age by the Ballard score method. Adding the scores assigned to each neonatal physical and neuromuscular sign yields a score corresponding to gestational age. Disappearance of the anterior vascular capsule of the lens is also helpful in determining gestational age. Until 27–28 weeks’ gestation, the lens capsule is covered by vessels; by 34 weeks, this vascular plexus is completely atrophied. Foot length, from the heel to the tip of the longest toe, also correlates with gestational age in appropriately grown infants. The foot measures 4.5 cm at 25 weeks’ gestation and increases 0.25 cm per week until term. If the physical examination indicates a gestational age within 2 weeks of that predicted by the obstetric dates, the gestational age is as assigned by the obstetric date. Birth weight and gestational age are plotted on standard grids (Figure 1–1) to determine whether the birth weight is appropriate for gestational age (AGA), small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA). Another term for SGA is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Birth weight for gestational age in normal neonates varies with  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Hypotonia and a weak cry may indicate systemic disease or congenital neuromuscular disorder. Check the following newborn reflexes: 1. Sucking reflex in response to a nipple or the examiner’s finger in the mouth. This reflex is observed by 14 weeks’ gestation. 2. Rooting reflex: Head turns to the side of a facial stimu- lus. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation. 3. Traction response: The infant is pulled by the arms to a sitting position. Initially, the head lags, then with active flexion, comes to the midline briefly before falling forward. 4. Palmar grasp with placement of the examiner’s finger in the palm. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation and disappears by age 4 months. 5. Deep tendon reflexes: Several beats of ankle clonus and an upgoing Babinski reflex may be normal. 6. Moro (startle) reflex: Hold the infant supine while sup- porting the head. Allow the head to drop 1–2 cm suddenly. The arms will abduct at the shoulder and extend at the elbow with spreading of the fingers. Adduction with flexion will follow. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation (incomplete) and disappears by age 3 months. 7. Tonic neck reflex: Forcibly turn the infant’s head to one side; the arm and leg on that side will extend while the opposite arm and leg flex (“fencing position”). This reflex disappears by age 8 months. Adam M, Hudgins L: The importance of minor anomalies in the evaluation of the newborn. NeoReviews 2003;4:e99.

29,Care of the Well Neonate,The Newborn Infant ,1706,"CARE OF THE WELL NEONATE The primary responsibility of the Level 1 nursery is care of the well neonate—promoting mother-infant bonding, establishing feeding, and teaching the basics of newborn care. Staff must monitor infants for signs and symptoms of illness, including temperature instability, change in activ- ity, refusal to feed, pallor, cyanosis, early or excessive jaundice, tachypnea, respiratory distress, delayed (beyond 24 hours) first stool or first void, and bilious vomiting. Several preventive measures are routine in the normal newborn nursery. Prophylactic erythromycin ointment is applied to the eyes within 1 hour of birth to prevent gonococcal oph- thalmia. Vitamin K (1 mg) is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously within 4 hours of birth to prevent hemor- rhagic disease of the newborn. All infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine. Both hepa- titis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) are administered if the mother is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). If maternal HBsAg status is unknown, vaccine should be given, maternal blood should be tested for HBsAg, and HBIG should be given to the neonate before 7 days of age if the test is positive. Cord blood is collected from all infants at birth and used for blood typing and Coombs testing if the mother is type O or Rh-negative. Rapid glucose testing should be performed in infants at risk for hypoglycemia (infants of diabetic mothers, preterm, SGA, LGA, or stressed infants). Values below 45 mg/dL should be confirmed by laboratory blood glucose testing and treated. Hematocrit should be measured at age 3–6 hours in infants at risk for or those who have symptoms of polycythe- mia or anemia. State-sponsored newborn genetic screens (for inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria [PKU], galac- tosemia, sickle cell disease, hypothyroidism, and cystic fibro- sis) are performed prior to discharge, after 24–48 hours of age if possible. In many states, a repeat test is required at 8– 14 days of age because the PKU test may be falsely negative when obtained before 48 hours of age. Not all state-man- dated screens include the same panel of diseases. The most recent addition in some states is a screen for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In infants with prolonged postpartum hospitalization, genetic screening should be performed by 1 week of age. In addition to the state-mandated screen, some centers offer expanded newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry to look for other inborn errors such as fatty acid oxidation defects. Infants should routinely be positioned supine to mini- mize the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Prone positioning is contraindicated unless there are com- pelling clinical reasons for that position. Bed sharing with adults and prone positioning are associated with increased risk of SIDS. FEEDING THE WELL NEONATE A neonate is ready for feeding if he or she is (1) alert and vigorous, (2) has no abdominal distention, (3) has good bowel sounds, and (4) has a normal hunger cry. These signs usually occur within 6 hours after birth, but fetal distress or traumatic delivery may prolong this period. The healthy full- term infant should be allowed to feed every 2–5 hours on demand. The first breast feeding may occur in the delivery room. For formula-fed infants, the first feeding usually occurs by 3 hours of life. The feeding volume generally increases from 0.5–1 oz per feeding initially to 1.5–2 oz per feeding on day 3. By day 3, the average full-term newborn takes about 100 mL/kg/d of milk. A wide range of infant formulas satisfy the nutritional needs of most neonates. Breast milk is the standard on which    CHAPTER 1 10 evoked otoacoustic emissions as early as possible because up to 40% of hearing loss will be missed by risk analysis alone. Primary care providers and parents should be advised of the possibility of hearing loss and offered immediate referral in suspect cases. With the use of universal screening, the aver- age age at which hearing loss is confirmed has dropped from 24–30 months to 2–3 months. If remediation is begun by 6 months, language and social development are commensu- rate with physical development.

32,Common Problems in the Term Newborn,The Newborn Infant ,943,"COMMON PROBLEMS  IN THE TERM NEWBORN NEONATAL JAUNDICE  General Considerations Sixty-five percent of newborns develop visible jaundice with a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level higher than 6 mg/dL during the first week of life. The normal newborn is deficient in antioxidants such as vitamin E, catalase, and superoxide dis- mutase. Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and peroxyl scaven- ger and may protect the newborn from oxygen toxicity in the first days of life. Approximately 8–10% of newborns develop excessive hyperbilirubinemia (TSB > 17 mg/dL), and 1–2% have TSB above 20 mg/dL. Extremely high and potentially dangerous TSB levels are rare. Approximately 1 in 700 infants have TSB higher than 25 mg/dL, and 1 in 10,000 have TSB above 30 mg/dL. Such high levels can cause kernicterus, characterized by injury to the basal ganglia and brainstem. Kernicterus caused by hyperbilirubinemia was common in neonates with Rh-isoimmunization until the institution of exchange transfusion for affected infants and postpar- tum high-titer Rho (D) immune globulin treatment for sensitized mothers. For several decades after the introduc- tion of exchange transfusion and phototherapy aimed at keeping the neonate’s TSB below 20 mg/dL, there were no reported cases of kernicterus in the United States. Since the early 1990s, however, there has been a reappearance of kernicterus, with more than 120 cases reported to a volun- tary registry. Common factors in the recent cases are newborn discharge before 48 hours (all but one), breast feeding (100%), delayed measurement of TSB, unrecog- nized hemolysis, lack of early postdischarge follow-up, and failure to recognize the early symptoms of encephalopathy. Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of heme (iron protoporphyrin) in the reticuloendothelial system and bone marrow. Heme is cleaved by heme oxygenase to iron, which is conserved; carbon monoxide, which is exhaled; and biliverdin, which is converted to bilirubin by bilirubin reductase. Each gram of hemoglobin yields 34 mg of biliru- bin (1 mg/dL = 17.2 mmol/L of bilirubin). This unconju- gated bilirubin is bound to albumin and carried to the liver, where it is taken up by hepatocytes. In the presence of the uridyldiphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT; glucuro- nyl transferase), bilirubin is conjugated to one or two glucu- Table 1–5. Contraindications  to early newborn discharge.

Twinning historically occurred at a rate of 1 in 80 pregnan- cies (1.25%). The incidence of twinning and higher-order multiple births in the United States has increased because of in-vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive tech- nologies. In 2002, twins occurred in 1 in 32 live births in the United States, with multiple births accounting for 3.3% of all births. A distinction should be made between dizygous (frater- nal) and monozygous (identical) twins. Race, maternal par- ity, and maternal age affect the incidence of dizygous, but not monozygous, twinning. Drugs used to induce ovulation, such as clomiphene citrate and gonadotropins, increase the incidence of dizygotic or polyzygotic twinning. Monozygous twinning also seems to be more common after assisted reproduction. The incidence of malformations is also increased in identical twins and may affect only one of the twins. If a defect is found in one twin, the other should be examined carefully for lesser degrees of the same defect. Early transvaginal ultrasound and examination of the placenta after birth can help establish the type of twinning: Two amnionic membranes and two chorionic membranes are found in all dizygous twins and in one third of monozy- gous twins even when the placental disks appear to be fused into one. A single chorionic membrane always indicates monozygous twins. The rare monochorial, monoamniotic situation (1% of twins) is especially dangerous, with a high risk of antenatal cord entanglement and death of one or both twins. Close fetal surveillance is indicated.  Complications of Multiple Births A. Intrauterine Growth Restriction There is some degree of IUGR in most multiple pregnancies, especially after 32 weeks, although it is usually not clinically significant with two exceptions. First, in monochorial twin pregnancy an arteriovenous shunt may develop between the twins (twin-twin transfusion syndrome). The twin on the venous side (recipient) becomes plethoric and larger than the smaller anemic twin (donor), who may ultimately die or be severely growth restricted. The occurrence of polyhy- dramnios in the larger twin and oligohydramnios in the smaller may be the first sign of this problem. Second, discordance in size (birth weights that are significantly dif- ferent) can also occur when separate placentas are present if one placenta develops poorly, because of a poor implanta- tion site. In this instance, no fetal exchange of blood takes place but the growth rates of the two infants are different. B. Preterm Delivery Length of gestation tends to be inversely related to the number of fetuses. The mean age at delivery for singletons is 38.8 weeks, for twins 35.3 weeks, for triplets 32.2 weeks, and for quadruplets 29.9 weeks. The prematurity rate in multiple gestations is 5–10 times that of singletons, with 50% of twins and 90% of triplets born before 37 weeks. There is an increased incidence of cerebral palsy in multiple births, more so with monochorial than dichorial infants. Prematurity is the main cause of increased mortality and morbidity in twins, although in the case of monochorial twins, intravascular exchange through placental anastomoses, particularly after the death of one twin, also increases the risk substantially. C. Obstetric Complications Polyhydramnios, pregnancy-induced hypertension, prema- ture rupture of membranes, abnormal fetal presentations, and prolapsed umbilical cord occur more frequently in women with multiple fetuses. Multiple pregnancy should always be identified prenatally with ultrasound examina- tions; doing so allows the obstetrician and pediatrician or neonatologist to plan management jointly. Because neonatal complications are usually related to prematurity, prolonga- tion of pregnancy significantly reduces neonatal morbidity.

47,Neonatal Intensive Care,The Newborn Infant ,4711,"NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE PERINATAL RESUSCITATION Perinatal resuscitation refers to the steps taken by the obstetri- cian to support the infant during labor and delivery and the resuscitative steps taken by the pediatrician after delivery. Intrapartum support includes maintaining maternal blood pressure, maternal oxygen therapy, positioning the mother to improve placental perfusion, readjusting oxytocin infusions or administering a tocolytic if appropriate, minimizing trauma to the infant, obtaining all necessary cord blood samples, and completing an examination of the placenta. The pediatrician or neonatologist focuses on temperature support, initiation and maintenance of effective ventilation, maintenance of per- fusion and hydration, and glucose regulation. A number of conditions associated with pregnancy, labor, and delivery place the infant at risk for birth    THE NEWBORN INFANT 41 ing problems, and rehospitalization after hospital discharge. The respiratory issues are caused by lack of clearance of lung fluid or relative deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, or both. Feeding issues are caused by lack of coordination of suck and swallow, which can interfere with bottle feeding and delay successful breast feeding, putting the infant at risk for poor weight gain and dehydration. Related both to feeding issues and immaturity, these infants have an eightfold increased risk of developing a TSB level above 20 mg/dL when com- pared with infants born after 40 completed weeks. As a consequence, late preterm infants are overrepresented in the kernicterus registry. Rehospitalizations due to jaundice, proven or suspected infection, feeding difficulties, and fail- ure to thrive are much more common than in term infants. Late preterm infants should be considered preterm rather than near term and require close in-hospital monitoring after birth for complications. After nursery discharge, close outpatient follow-up is indicated, especially if they are sent home within 48–72 hours after birth. Adamkin DH: Feeding problems in the late preterm infant.

63,Cardiac Problems in the Newborn Infant,The Newborn Infant ,1711,"CARDIAC PROBLEMS  IN THE NEWBORN INFANT STRUCTURAL HEART DISEASE 1. Cyanotic Presentations ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Cyanosis, initially without associated respiratory dis- tress.  Failure to increase PaO2 with supplemental oxygen.  Chest radiograph with decreased lung markings sug- gests right heart obstruction, while increased lung markings suggest transposition or pulmonary venous obstruction.  General Considerations The causes of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn are transposition of the great vessels, total anomalous pulmo- nary venous return, truncus arteriosus (some types), tricus- pid atresia, and pulmonary atresia or critical pulmonary stenosis.  Clinical Findings Infants with these disorders present with early cyanosis. The hallmark of many of these lesions is cyanosis without associ- ated respiratory distress. In most of these infants, tachypnea develops over time either because of increased pulmonary blood flow or secondary to metabolic acidemia from pro- gressive hypoxemia. Diagnostic aids include comparing the blood gas or oxygen saturation in room air to that in 100% FIO2. Failure of PaO2 or SaO2 to increase suggests cyanotic heart disease. Note: A PaO2, if feasible, is the preferred measure. Saturation in the newborn may be misleadingly high despite pathologically low PaO2 due to the left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve seen with fetal hemoglo- bin. Other useful aids are chest radiography, electrocardiog- raphy, and echocardiography. Transposition of the great vessels is the most common form of cyanotic heart disease presenting in the newborn. Examination generally reveals a systolic murmur and single S2. Chest radiograph shows a generous heart size and a narrow mediastinum with normal or increased lung mark- ings. There is little change in PaO2 or SaO2 with supplemental oxygen. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return, in which venous return is obstructed, presents early with severe cyanosis and tachypnea because the pulmonary venous return is obstructed, resulting in pulmonary edema. The chest radiograph typically shows a small to normal heart size with marked pulmonary edema. Infants with right heart obstruction (pulmonary and tricuspid atresia, critical pul- monary stenosis, and some forms of truncus arteriosus) have decreased lung markings on chest radiographs and, depend- ing on the severity of hypoxia, may develop metabolic acidemia. Those lesions with an underdeveloped right heart will have left-sided predominance on electrocardiography. Although tetralogy of Fallot is the most common form of cyanotic heart disease, the obstruction at the pulmonary valve is often not severe enough to result in cyanosis in the newborn. In all cases, diagnosis can be confirmed by echo- cardiography. 2. Acyanotic Presentations ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Most newborns with acyanotic heart disease have left- sided outflow obstruction.  Differentially diminished pulses (coarctation) or decreased pulses throughout (aortic atresia).  Metabolic acidemia.    THE NEWBORN INFANT 43 bates pulmonary vasoconstriction. In some cases, a mild respiratory alkalosis may improve oxygenation. Pulmonary vasodilation can be enhanced using inhaled nitric oxide, which is identical or very similar to endogenous endothe- lium-derived relaxing factor, at doses of 5–20 ppm. High- frequency oscillatory ventilation has proved effective in many of these infants, particularly those with severe associated lung disease. Infants for whom conventional therapy is failing (poor oxygenation despite maximum support) may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The lungs are essentially at rest during ECMO, and with resolution of pulmonary hypertension infants are weaned from ECMO back to ventilator therapy. Approximately 10–15% of survi- vors of PPHN have significant neurologic sequelae, with cerebral palsy or cognitive delays. Other sequelae such as chronic lung disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and feeding problems have also been reported. ARRHYTHMIAS Irregularly irregular heart rates, commonly associated with premature atrial contractions and less commonly with pre- mature ventricular contractions, are common in the first days of life in well newborns. These arrhythmias are benign. Clinically significant bradyarrhythmias are seen in associa- tion with congenital heart block. Heart block can be seen in an otherwise structurally normal heart (associated with maternal lupus) or with structural cardiac abnormalities. In the absence of fetal hydrops, the bradyarrhythmia is often well tolerated. Cardiac pacing may be required if there are symptoms of inadequate cardiac output. On ECG, tachyarrhythmias can be either wide complex (ventricular tachycardia) or narrow complex (supraventricu- lar tachycardia). Supraventricular tachycardia is the most common neonatal tachyarrhythmia and may be a sign of structural heart disease, myocarditis, left atrial enlargement, and aberrant conduction pathways. Acute treatment is ice to the face, and if unsuccessful, IV adenosine (50–200 mcg/kg). If there is no response, the dose can be increased to 300 mcg/kg. Long-term therapy is with digoxin or propranolol. Digoxin should not be used in infants with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Cardioversion is rarely needed for supraventricular tachycardia but is needed acutely for hemodynamically unsta- ble ventricular tachycardia. Kothari DS, Skinner JR: Neonatal tachycardias: An update.

65,Gastrointestinal & Abdominal Surgical  Conditions in the Newborn Infant,The Newborn Infant ,2912,"GASTROINTESTINAL & ABDOMINAL  SURGICAL CONDITIONS IN THE NEWBORN  INFANT (SEE ALSO CHAPTER 20) ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA & TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Polyhydramnios.  Excessive drooling and secretions; choking with attempted feeding.  Unable to pass an orogastric tube to the stomach.  General Considerations Esophageal atresia is characterized by a blind esophageal pouch with or without a fistulous connection between the proximal or distal esophagus (or both) and the airway. In 85% of infants, the fistula is between the distal esophagus and the airway. Polyhydramnios is common because of high GI obstruction. Incidence is approximately 1 in 3000 births.  Clinical Findings Infants present in the first hours of life with copious secre- tions, choking, cyanosis, and respiratory distress. Diagnosis is confirmed with chest radiograph after careful placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube to the point at which resistance is met. The tube will be seen radiographically in the blind pouch. If a tracheoesophageal fistula is present to the distal esophagus, gas will be present in the bowel. In esophageal atresia without tracheoesophageal fistula, there is no gas in the bowel.  Treatment The NG tube in the proximal pouch should be placed on low intermittent suction to drain secretions and prevent aspiration. The head of the bed should be elevated to prevent reflux of gastric contents through the distal fistula into the lungs. IV glucose and fluids should be provided and oxygen administered as needed. Definitive treatment is surgical, and the technique used depends on the distance between the segments of esophagus. If the distance is not too great, the fistula can be ligated and the ends of the esophagus anastomosed. If the ends of the esophagus cannot be brought together, the initial surgery is fistula ligation and a feeding gastrostomy. Echocardiography should be performed prior to surgery to rule out a right-sided aortic arch (for which a left-sided thoracotomy would be preferred).  Prognosis Prognosis is determined primarily by the presence or absence of associated anomalies. Vertebral, anal, cardiac,    CHAPTER 1 46 genital cardiac defects. Affected infants are prone to develop- ment of pneumothorax during attempts at ventilation of the hypoplastic lungs. Treatment includes intubation, mechanical ventilation, and decompression of the GI tract with an NG tube. An IV infusion of glucose and fluid should be started. A chest radiograph confirms the diagnosis. Surgery to reduce the abdominal con- tents from the thorax and close the diaphragmatic defect is delayed until after the infant is stabilized and pulmonary hyper- tension and compliance have improved, usually after 24–48 hours. Both pre- and postoperatively, pulmonary hypertension may require therapy with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, or ECMO. The survival rate for infants with this condition is improving, and now approaches 80–90%, with survival dependent on the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia and presence of congenital heart disease or chromosomal abnormal- ities. Use of a gentle ventilation style and permissive hypercarbia is recommended to avoid barotrauma and further lung injury. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING  Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Upper GI bleeding sometimes occurs in the newborn nurs- ery, but is rarely severe. Old blood (“coffee-grounds” mate- rial) in the stomach of the newborn may be either swallowed maternal blood or infant blood from gastritis or stress ulcer. Bright red blood from the stomach is most likely from acute bleeding, again due to gastritis. Treatment generally consists of gastric lavage (a sample can be sent for Apt testing or blood typing to determine if it is mother’s or baby’s blood) and antacid medication. If the volume of bleeding is large, intensive monitoring, fluid and blood replacement, and endoscopy are indicated. Coagulation studies should also be sent. (See Chapter 20.)  Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding Rectal bleeding in the newborn is less common than upper GI bleeding and is associated with infections (eg, Salmonella acquired from the mother perinatally), milk intolerance (blood streaks with diarrhea), or, in ill infants, NEC. An abdominal radiograph should be obtained to rule out pneumatosis intesti- nalis or other abnormalities in gas pattern suggesting inflamma- tion, infection, or obstruction. If the radiograph is negative and the examination is benign, a protein hydrolysate or predigested formula (eg, Nutramigen or Pregestimil) should be tried. The nursing mother should be instructed to avoid all dairy products in her diet. If the amount of rectal bleeding is large or persistent, endoscopy may be needed. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX  (SEE ALSO CHAPTER 20) Physiologic regurgitation is common in infants. Reflux is pathologic and should be treated when it results in failure to thrive owing to excessive regurgitation, poor intake due to dysphagia and irritability, apnea or cyanotic episodes, or chronic respiratory symptoms of wheezing and recurrent pneumonias. Diagnosis is clinical, with confirmation by pH probe or impedance study. Barium radiography is helpful to rule out anatomic abnormalities but is not diagnostic of pathologic reflux. Initial steps in treatment include thickened feeds (rice cereal, 1 tbsp/oz of formula) for those with frequent regurgita- tion and poor weight gain. Gastric acid suppressants such as ranitidine (2 mg/kg bid) or lansoprazole (1.5 mg/kg/d) can also be used, especially if there is associated irritability. Proki- netic agents such as metoclopramide are of little benefit and have significant side effects. Because most infants improve by 12–15 months of age, surgery is reserved for the most severe cases, especially those with chronic neurologic or respiratory conditions that exacerbate reflux, and those who have life- threatening events caused by reflux.

68,Infections in the Newborn Infant,The Newborn Infant ,4791,"INFECTIONS IN THE NEWBORN INFANT The fetus and the newborn are susceptible to infections. There are three major routes of perinatal infection: (1) blood-borne transplacental infection of the fetus (eg, cytomegalovirus, rubella, and syphilis); (2) ascending infection with disrup- tion of the barrier provided by the amniotic membranes (eg, bacterial infections after 12–18 hours of ruptured mem- branes); and (3) infection on passage through an infected birth canal or exposure to infected blood at delivery (eg, herpes simplex, hepatitis B, HIV, and bacterial infections). Susceptibility of the newborn infant to infection is related to immaturity of both the cellular and humoral immune systems at birth. This feature is particularly evident in the preterm neonate. Passive protection against some organisms is provided by transfer of IgG across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy. Preterm infants, especially those born before 30 weeks’ gestation, do not have the full amount of passively acquired antibody.    THE NEWBORN INFANT 55 Shetty AK, Maldonado Y: Advances in the prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission.

77,Hematologic Disorders in the Newborn Infant,The Newborn Infant ,229,"HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS  IN THE NEWBORN INFANT BLEEDING DISORDERS Neonatal coagulation is discussed in Chapter 28. Bleeding in the newborn infant may result from inherited clotting defi- ciencies (eg, factor VIII deficiency) or acquired disorders— hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, disseminated intravascu- lar coagulation, liver failure, and isolated thrombocytopenia. 1. Vitamin K Deficiency  Bleeding of the Newborn ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Frequently exclusively breast fed, otherwise clinically well infant.  Bleeding from mucous membranes, GI tract, skin, or internal (intracranial).  Prolonged prothrombin time (PT), relatively normal partial thromboplastin time (PTT), normal fibrinogen and platelet count. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding is caused by the deficiency of the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X). Bleeding occurs in 0.25–1.7% of newborns who do not receive vitamin K prophylaxis after birth, generally in the first 5 days to 2 weeks, but as late as 12 weeks in an otherwise well infant. There is an increased risk in infants of mothers receiving therapy with anticonvulsants that interfere with vitamin K metabolism. Early vitamin K deficiency bleeding (0–2 weeks) can be prevented by either parenteral or oral vitamin K administration, whereas late disease is most effec- tively prevented by administering parenteral vitamin K. Sites of ecchymoses and surface bleeding include the GI tract, umbilical cord, circumcision site, and nose, although devas- tating intracranial hemorrhage can occur. Bleeding from vitamin K deficiency is more likely to occur in exclusively breast-fed infants because of very low amounts of vitamin K in breast milk, with slower and more restricted intestinal colonization. Differential diagnosis includes disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatic failure (Table 1–23). Treatment consists of 1 mg of vitamin K SC or IV. IM injections should be avoided in infants who are actively bleeding. Such infants may also require factor replacement in addition to vitamin K administration. 2. Thrombocytopenia ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Generalized petechiae; oozing at cord or puncture sites.  Thrombocytopenia, often marked (platelets < 10,000– 20,000/mL).  In an otherwise well infant, suspect isoimmune throm- bocytopenia.  In a sick or asphyxiated infant, suspect disseminated intravascular coagulation.  Table 1–23. Features of infants bleeding from vitamin K deficiency  (VKDB), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or liver failure.

Additionally, if blood loss is the cause of the anemia, early supplementation with iron will be needed. It is important to remember that hemolysis related to blood group incompatibility can continue for weeks after birth. Serial hematocrits should be followed, because late transfu- sion may be needed. POLYCYTHEMIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Hematocrit > 65% (venous) at term.  Plethora, tachypnea, retractions.  Hypoglycemia, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding. Polycythemia in the newborn is manifested by plethora, cyanosis, respiratory distress with tachypnea and oxygen need, hypoglycemia, poor feeding, emesis, irritability, and lethargy. Hyperbilirubinemia is expected. The consequence of polycythemia is hyperviscosity with decreased perfusion of the capillary beds. Clinical symptomatology can affect several organ systems (Table 1–25). Renal vein, other deep vein, or artery thrombosis is a severe complication. Screen- ing can be done by measuring a capillary (heelstick) hemat- ocrit. If the value is greater than 68%, a peripheral venous hematocrit should be measured. Values greater than 65% should be considered consistent with hyperviscosity. The diagnosis of polycythemia should not be based solely on a capillary hematocrit. Elevated hematocrits occur in 2–5% of live births. Delayed cord clamping is the most common cause of benign neonatal polycythemia. Although 50% of polycythemic infants are AGA, the prevalence of polycythemia is greater in the SGA and LGA populations. Other causes of increased hematocrit include (1) twin-twin transfusion, (2) maternal-fetal transfu- sion, and (3) chronic intrauterine hypoxia (SGA infants and LGA infants of diabetic mothers). Treatment is recommended for symptomatic infants. Treatment for asymptomatic infants based strictly on hemato- crit is controversial. Definitive treatment is isovolemic partial exchange transfusion with normal saline, effectively decreasing the hematocrit. The amount to exchange (in milliliters) is calculated using the following formula: Number of Milliliters to exchange  = (PVH – DH)/PVH × BV(mL/kg) × Wt(kg) where PVH is peripheral venous hematocrit, DH is desired hematocrit, BV is blood volume in mL/kg, and Wt is weight in kilograms. Blood is withdrawn at a steady rate from an umbilical venous line while the replacement solution is infused at the same rate through a peripheral IV line over 15–30 minutes. The desired hematocrit value is 50–55%; the assumed blood volume is 80 mL/kg. American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on the Fetus and Newborn: Controversies concerning vitamin K and the new- born.

79,Renal Disorders in the Newborn Infant,The Newborn Infant ,3946,"RENAL DISORDERS IN THE NEWBORN  INFANT (SEE ALSO CHAPTER 22) Renal function depends on postconceptional age. The glo- merular filtration rate is 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 in full-term neonates and 10–13 mL/min/1.73 m2 in infants born at 28– 30 weeks’ gestation. The speed of maturation after birth also depends on postconceptional age. Creatinine can be used as a clinical marker of glomerular filtration rate. Values in the first month of life are shown in Table 1–26. Creatinine at birth reflects the maternal level and should decrease slowly Table 1–25. Organ-related symptoms of hyperviscosity.

At particular risk is the IDM with polycy- themia. If fetal distress is superimposed on polycythemia and dehydration, prompt reduction in blood viscosity is indicated. Thrombosis usually begins in intrarenal venules and can extend into larger veins. Hematuria, oliguria, thrombocytope- nia, and possibly an enlarged kidney raise suspicion for this diagnosis. With bilateral renal vein thrombosis, anuria ensues. Diagnosis can be confirmed with an ultrasound examina- tion that includes Doppler flow studies of the kidneys. Treatment involves correcting the predisposing condition and systemic heparinization for the thrombosis. Use of throm- bolytics for this condition is controversial. Prognosis for a full recovery is uncertain. Some infants will develop significant atrophy of the affected kidney and systemic hypertension.

81,Neurologic Problems in the Newborn Infant,The Newborn Infant ,1284,"NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS IN  THE NEWBORN INFANT SEIZURES ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Usual onset at 12–48 hours.  Most common seizure type is characterized by a constellation of findings.  Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic enceph- alopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete cortical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal deviation of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells. Strictly tonic or multifocal clonic episodes are also seen.  Clinical Findings The differential diagnosis of neonatal seizures is presented in Table 1–27. Most neonatal seizures occur between 12 and 48 hours of age. Later-onset seizures suggest meningitis, benign familial seizures, or hypocalcemia. Information regarding ante- natal drug use, the presence of birth asphyxia or trauma, and family history (regarding inherited disorders) should be obtained. Physical examination focuses on neurologic features, other signs of drug withdrawal, concurrent signs of infection, dysmorphic features, and intrauterine growth. Screening workup should include blood glucose, ionized calcium, and electrolytes in all cases. Further workup depends on diagnoses suggested by the history and physical examination. If there is any suspicion of infection, a lumbar puncture should be done. Hemorrhages and structural disease of the CNS can be addressed with ultrasound, CT, and MRI scans. Metabolic workup should be pursued when appropriate. EEG should be done; the presence of spike discharges must be noted and the background wave pattern evaluated. At times correlation between EEG changes and clinical seizure activity is absent.  Treatment Adequate ventilation and perfusion should be ensured. Hypoglycemia should be treated immediately with a 2-mL/ kg infusion of D10W followed by 6 mg/kg/min of D10W (100 mL/kg/d). Other treatments such as calcium or magnesium infusion and antibiotics are indicated to treat hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and suspected infection. Electrolyte  Table 1–27. Differential diagnosis of neonatal seizures.

Phenobarbital (20 mg/kg IV) should be administered to stop seizures. Supplemental doses of 5 mg/kg can be used if seizures persist, up to a total of 40 mg/kg. In most cases, phenobarbital controls seizures. If seizures continue, therapy with fosphenytoin, sodium valproate, or lorazepam may be indicated. For refractory seizures, a trial of pyridoxine is indicated.  Prognosis Outcome is related to the underlying cause of the seizure. The outcomes for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and intraventricular hemorrhage have been discussed earlier in this chapter. In these settings, seizures that are difficult to control carry a poor prognosis for normal development. Seizures resulting from hypoglycemia, infection of the CNS, some inborn errors of metabolism, and developmental defects also have a high rate of poor outcome. Seizures caused by hypocalcemia or isolated subarachnoid hemor- rhage generally resolve without sequelae. HYPOTONIA One should be alert to the diagnosis of congenital hypotonia when a mother has polyhydramnios and a history of poor fetal movement. The newborn may present with poor respi- ratory effort and birth asphyxia. For a discussion of causes and evaluation, see Chapter 23. INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE1 1. Subdural Hemorrhage Subdural hemorrhage is related to birth trauma; the bleeding is caused by tears in the veins that bridge the subdural space. Prospective studies relating incidence to specific obstetric complications are not available. The most common site of subdural bleeding is in rup- tured superficial cerebral veins with blood over the cerebral convexities. These hemorrhages can be asymptomatic or may cause seizures, with onset on days 2–3 of life, vomiting, irritability, and lethargy. Associated findings include retinal hemorrhages and a full fontanelle. The diagnosis is con- firmed by CT scan. Specific treatment entailing needle drainage of the sub- dural space is rarely necessary. Most infants survive; 75% are normal on follow-up. 2. Primary Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Primary subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most common type of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage. In the full-term infant, it can be related to trauma of delivery, whereas subarachnoid hemorrhage in the preterm infant is seen in association with germinal matrix hemorrhage. Clinically, these hemorrhages can be asymptomatic or can present with seizures and irritability on day 2, or rarely, a massive hemorrhage with a rapid downhill course. The seizures associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage are very charac- teristic—usually brief, with a normal examination interic- tally. Diagnosis can be suspected on lumbar puncture and confirmed with CT scan. Long-term follow-up is uniformly good. 3. Neonatal Stroke Focal cerebral ischemic injury can occur in the context of intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature infant and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Neonatal stroke has also been described in the context of underlying disor- ders of thrombolysis, maternal drug use (cocaine), a history of infertility, preeclampsia, prolonged membrane rupture, and chorioamnionitis. In some cases, the origin is unclear. The injury often occurs antenatally. The most common clinical presentation of an isolated cerebral infarct is with seizures, and diagnosis can be confirmed acutely with diffusion-weighted MRI scan. The most fre- quently described distribution is that of the middle cere- bral artery. Treatment is directed at controlling seizures. Long-term outcome is variable, ranging from near-normal to hemiple- gias and cognitive deficits. Chalmers EA: Perinatal stroke—risk factors and management.

82,Metabolic Disorders in the Newborn Infant,The Newborn Infant ,4223,"METABOLIC DISORDERS  IN THE NEWBORN INFANT2 HYPERGLYCEMIA Hyperglycemia may develop in preterm infants, particularly those of extremely low birth weight who are also SGA. Glucose concentrations may exceed 200–250 mg/dL, partic- ularly in the first few days of life.

This chapter provides an overview of typical development, identifies developmental variations, and discusses several developmental disabilities. First, it discusses "
85,Normal Development,The Newborn Infant ,442,"normal development, but does not cover the newborn period or adolescence (see Chapters 1 and 3, respectively). Second, it addresses behavioral variations, emphasizing that these variations reflect the spectrum of normal development and not pathology. Third, it deals with developmental and behavioral disorders and their treatment. The developmental principle, that is, the concept of ongoing change and maturation, is integral to the daily practice of pediatrics. For example, we recognize that a 3-month-old infant is very different from a 3-year-old and from a 13-year- old adolescent, not only with respect to what the child can do, but also in terms of the kind of illness he or she might have. From the perspective of the general pediatrician all of these areas should be viewed in the context of a “medical home.” The medical home is defined as the setting that provides consistent, continuous, culturally competent, com- prehensive and sensitive care to children and their families. It is a setting that advocates for all children, whether they are typical or have developmental challenges or disabilities. By incorporating the principles of child development—the con- cept that children are constantly changing—the medical home is the optimum setting to understand and enhance typical development and to address variations, delays, and deviations as they may occur in the life-trajectory of the child and family. NORMAL DEVELOPMENT Typical children follow a trajectory of increasing physical size (Figures 2–1 through 2–10) and increasing complexity of function (Figures 2–7 and 2–8 and Tables 2–1 and 2–2). Table 2–3 provides the theoretical perspectives of human behavior, taking into consideration the work of Freud, Erik- son, and Piaget. The first 5 years of life are a period of extraordinary physical growth and increasing complexity of function. The child triples his or her birth weight within the first year and achieves two thirds of his or her brain size by age 21/2–3 years. The child progresses from a totally dependent infant at birth to a mobile, verbal person who is able to express his or her needs and desires by age 2–3 years. In the ensuing 3 years the child further develops the capacity to interact with peers and adults, achieves considerable verbal and physical prowess, and becomes ready to enter the academic world of learning and socialization. It is critical for the clinician to identify disturbances in development during these early years because there may be windows of time or sensitive periods when appropriate interventions may be instituted to effectively address devel- opmental issues. THE FIRST 2 YEARS From a motor perspective, children develop in a cephalocau- dal direction. They can lift their heads with good control at 3 months, sit independently at 6 months, crawl at 9 months, walk at 1 year, and run by 18 months. The child learning to walk has a wide-based gait at first. Next, he or she walks with legs closer together, the arms move medially, a heel-toe gait develops, and the arms swing symmetrically by 18–24 months. Clinicians often focus on gross motor development, but an appreciation of fine motor development and dexterity, particularly the grasp, can be instructive not only in moni- toring normal development but also in identifying devia- tions in development. The grasp begins as a raking motion involving the ulnar aspect of the hand at age 3–4 months.

Once the child can walk independently, he or she can move away from the parent and explore the environment. Although the child uses the parent, usually the mother, as “home base,” returning to her frequently for reassurance, he or she has now taken a major step toward indepen- dence. This is the beginning of mastery over the environ- ment and an emerging sense of self. The “terrible twos” and the frequent self-asserting use of “no” are the child’s attempt to develop a better idea of what is or might be under his or her control. The child is starting to assert his or her autonomy. Ego development during this time should be fostered but with appropriate limits. As children develop a sense of self, they begin to understand the feelings of others and develop empathy. They hug another child who is in perceived distress or become concerned when one is hurt. They begin to understand how another child feels when he or she is harmed, and this realization helps them to inhibit their own aggressive behavior. Chil- dren also begin to understand right and wrong and parental expectations. They recognize that they have done some- thing “bad” and may signify that awareness by saying “uh- oh” or with other expressions of distress. They also take pleasure in their accomplishments and become more aware of their bodies. An area of child behavior that has often been over- looked is play. Play is the child’s work and a significant means of learning. Play is a very complex process whose purpose can include the practice and rehearsal of roles, skills, and relationships; a means of revisiting the past; a means of actively mastering a range of experiences; and a way to integrate the child’s life experiences. It involves emotional development (affect regulation and gender iden- tification and roles), cognitive development (nonverbal and verbal function and executive functioning and creativ- ity), and social/motor development (motor coordination, frustration tolerance, and social interactions such as turn- taking). Of interest is the fact that play has a developmental progression. The typical 6- to 12-month-old engages in the game of peek-a-boo, which is a form of social interaction. During the next year or so, although children engage in increasingly complex social interactions and imitation, their play is primarily solitary. However, they do begin to engage in symbolic play such as by drinking from a toy cup and then by giving a doll a drink from a toy cup. By age 2– 3 years children begin to engage in parallel play (engaging in behaviors that are imitative). This form of play gradually evolves into more interactive or collaborative play by age 3–4 years and is also more thematic in nature. There are of course wide variations in the development of play, reflect- ing cultural, educational, and socioeconomic variables. Nevertheless, the development of play does follow a sequence that can be assessed and can be very informative in the evaluation of the child. Brain maturation sets the stage for toilet training. After age 18 months, toddlers have the sensory capacity for awareness of a full rectum or bladder and are physically able to control bowel and urinary tract sphincters. They also take great pleasure in their accomplishments, particularly in appropriate elimination, if it is reinforced positively. Chil- dren must be given some control over when elimination occurs. If parents impose severe restrictions, the achieve- ment of this developmental milestone can become a battle between parent and child. Freud termed this period the anal stage because the developmental issue of bowel control is the major task requiring mastery. It encompasses a more generalized theme of socialized behavior and overall body cleanliness, which is usually taught or imposed on the child at this age. "
102,Ages 2–4 Years,Child Development & Behavior ,3912,"AGES 2–4 YEARS Piaget characterized the 2- to 6-year-old stage as preopera- tional. This stage begins when language has facilitated the creation of mental images in the symbolic sense. The child begins to manipulate the symbolic world; sorts out reality from fantasy imperfectly; and may be terrified of dreams, wishes, and foolish threats. Most of the child’s perception of the world is egocentric or interpreted in reference to his or her needs or influence. Cause-effect relationships are con- fused with temporal ones or interpreted egocentrically. For example, children may focus their understanding of divorce on themselves (“My father left because I was bad” or “My mother left because she didn’t love me”). Illness and the need for medical care are also commonly misinterpreted at this age. The child may make a mental connection between a sibling’s illness and a recent argument, a negative comment, or a wish for the sibling to be ill. The child may experience significant guilt unless the parents are aware of these misper- ceptions and take time to deal with them. At this age, children also endow inanimate objects with human feelings. They also assume that humans cause or create all natural events. For instance, when asked why the sun sets, they may say, “The sun goes to his house” or “It is pushed down by someone else.” Magical thinking blossoms between ages 3 and 5 years as symbolic thinking incorpo- rates more elaborate fantasy. Fantasy facilitates develop- ment of role playing, sexual identity, and emotional growth. Children test new experiences in fantasy, both in their imagination and in play. In their play, children often create magical stories and novel situations that reflect issues with which they are dealing, such as aggression, relationships, fears, and control. Children often invent imaginary friends at this time, and nightmares or fears of monsters are common. At this stage, other children become important in facilitating play, such as in a pre- school group. Play gradually becomes more cooperative; shared fantasy leads to game playing. Freud described the oedipal phase between ages 3 and 6 years, when there is   CHILD DEVELOPMENT & BEHAVIOR 81 strong attachment to the parent of the opposite sex.

104,Normality & Temperament,Child Development & Behavior ,1124,"NORMALITY & TEMPERAMENT The physician confronted by a disturbance in physiologic function rarely has doubts about what is abnormal. Varia- tions in temperament and behavior are not as straightfor- ward. Labeling such variations as disorders implies that a disease entity exists. The behaviors described in this section are viewed as part of a continuum of responses by the child to a variety of internal and external experiences. Variations in tempera- ment have been of interest to philosophers and writers since ancient times. The Greeks believed there were four tempera- ment types: choleric, sanguine, melancholic, and phlegmatic. In more recent times, folk wisdom has defined temperament as a genetically influenced behavioral disposition that is stable over time. Although a number of models of tempera- ment have been proposed, the one usually used by pediatri- cians in clinical practice is that of Thomas and Chess, who describe temperament as being the “how” of behavior as distinguished from the “why” (motivation) and the “what” (ability). Temperament is an independent psychological attribute that is expressed as a response to an external stimulus. The influence of temperament is bidirectional: The effect of a particular experience will be influenced by the child’s temperament, and the child’s temperament will influ- ence the responses of others in the child’s environment. Temperament is the style with which the child interacts with the environment. The perceptions and expectations of parents must be considered when a child’s behavior is evaluated. A child that one parent might describe as hyperactive might not be characterized as such by the other parent. This truism can be expanded to include all the dimensions of temperament. Thus, the concept of “goodness of fit” comes into play. For example, if the parents want and expect their child to be predictable but that is not the child’s behavioral style, the parents may perceive the child as being bad or having a behavioral disorder rather than as having a developmental variation. An appreciation of this phenomenon is important because the physician may be able to enhance the parents’ understanding of the child and influence their responses to the child’s behavior. When there is goodness of fit, there will be more harmony and a greater potential for healthy devel- opment not only of the child but also of the family. When goodness of fit is not present, tension and stress can result in parental anger, disappointment, frustration, and conflict with the child. Other models of temperament include those of Roth- bart, Buss and Plomin, and Goldsmith and Campos (Table 2–4). All models seek to identify intrinsic behavioral char- acteristics that lead the child to respond to the world in particular ways. One child may be highly emotional and another less so (ie, calmer) in response to a variety of experiences, stressful or pleasant. The clinician must recog- nize that each child brings some intrinsic, biologically based traits to its environment and that such characteristics are neither good nor bad, right nor wrong, normal nor abnormal; they are simply part of the child. Thus, as one looks at variations in development, one should abandon the illness model and consider this construct as an aid to understanding the nature of the child’s behavior and its influence on the parent-child relationship.

Brunner/ Mazel, 1977. Table 2–4. Theories of temperament. Thomas and  Chess Temperament is an independent psychologic  attribute, biologically determined, which is expressed  as a response to an external stimulus. It is the child’s  behavioral style: an interactive model. Rothbart Temperament is a function of biologically based  individual differences in reactivity and self-regula- tion. It is subsumed under the concept of “personal- ity” and goes beyond mere “behavioral style.” Buss and  Plomin Temperament is a set of genetically determined  personality traits that appear early in life and are  different from other inherited and acquired person- ality traits. Goldsmith and  Campos Temperament is the individual’s differences in the  probability of experiencing emotions and arousal.   CHILD DEVELOPMENT & BEHAVIOR 83 "
105,Common Developmental Concerns,Child Development & Behavior ,34,"COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL CONCERNS COLIC ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  An otherwise healthy infant aged 2–3 months seems to be in pain, cries for > 3 hours a day, for > 3 days a week, for > 3 weeks (“rule of threes”). Infant colic is characterized by severe and paroxysmal crying that occurs mainly in the late afternoon. The infant’s knees are drawn up and its fists are clenched, flatus is expelled, the facies is pained, and there is minimal response to attempts at soothing. Studies in the United States have shown that among middle-class infants, crying occupies about 2 hours per day at 2 weeks of age, about 3 hours per day by 6 weeks, and gradually decreases to about 1 hour per day by 3 months. The word “colic” is derived from Greek kolikos (“pertaining to the colon”). Although colic has traditionally been attrib- uted to gastrointestinal disturbances, this has never been proved. Colic is a behavioral sign or symptom that begins in the first few weeks of life and peaks at age 2–3 months. In about 30–40% of cases, colic continues into the fourth and fifth months. A colicky infant, as defined by Wessel, is one who is healthy and well fed but cries for more than 3 hours a day, for more than 3 days a week, and for more than 3 weeks— commonly referred to as the rule of threes. The important word in this definition is “healthy.” Thus, before the diagno- sis of colic can be made, the pediatrician must rule out diseases that might cause crying. With the exception of the few infants who respond to elimination of cow’s milk from its own or the mother’s diet, there has been little firm evidence of an association of colic with allergic disorders. Gastroesophageal reflux is often suspected as a cause of colicky crying in young infants. Undetected corneal abra- sion, urinary tract infection, and unrecognized traumatic injuries, including child abuse, must be among the physical causes of crying considered in evaluating these infants. Some attempts have been made to eliminate gas with simethicone and to slow gut motility with dicyclomine. Simethicone has not been shown to ameliorate colic. Dicyclomine has been associated with apnea in infants and is contraindicated. This then leaves characteristics intrinsic to the child (ie, temperament) and parental caretaking patterns as contribut- ing to colic. Behavioral states have three features: (1) they are self-organizing—that is, they are maintained until it is nec- essary to shift to another one; (2) they are stable over several minutes; and (3) the same stimulus elicits a state-specific response that is different from other states. The behavioral states are (among others) a crying state, a quiet alert state, an active alert state, a transitional state, and a state of deep sleep. The states of importance with respect to colic are the crying state and the transitional state. During transition from one state to another, infant behavior may be more easily influ- enced. Once an infant is in a stable state (eg, crying), it becomes more difficult to bring about a change (eg, to soothe). How these transitions are accomplished is probably influenced by the infant’s temperament and neurologic maturity. Some infants move from one state to another easily and can be diverted easily; other infants sustain a particular state and are resistant to change. The other component to be considered in evaluating the colicky infant is the feeding and handling behavior of the caregiver. Colic is a behavioral phenomenon that involves interaction between the infant and the caregiver. Different caregivers perceive and respond to crying behavior differ- ently. If the caregiver perceives the crying infant as being spoiled and demanding and is not sensitive to or knowl- edgeable about the infant’s cues and rhythms—or is hur- ried and “rough” with the infant—the infant’s ability to organize and soothe him- or herself or respond to the caregiver’s attempts at soothing may be compromised. Alternatively, if the temperament of an infant with colic is understood and the rhythms and cues deciphered, crying can be anticipated and the caregiver can intervene before the behavior becomes “organized” in the crying state and more difficult to extinguish.  Management Several approaches can be taken to the management of colic. 1. Parents may need to be educated about the developmen- tal characteristics of crying behavior and made aware that crying increases normally into the second month and abates by the third to fourth month. 2. Parents may need reassurance, based on a complete history and physical examination, that the infant is not sick. Although these behaviors are stressful, they are a normal variant and are usually self-limited. This discus- sion can be facilitated by having the parent keep a diary of crying and weight gain. If there is a diurnal pattern and adequate weight gain, an underlying disease process is less likely to be present. Parental anxiety must be relieved, because it may be contributing to the problem. 3. For parents to effectively soothe and comfort the infant, they need to understand the infant’s cues. The pediatri- cian can help by observing the infant’s behavior and devising interventions aimed at calming both the infant and the parents. One can encourage a quiet environment without excessive handling. Rhythmic stimulation such as gentle swinging or rocking, soft music, drives in the car, or walks in the stroller may be helpful, especially if the parents are able to anticipate the onset of crying. Another approach is to change the feeding habits so that the infant is not rushed, has ample opportunity to burp, and if necessary can be fed more frequently so as to    CHILD DEVELOPMENT & BEHAVIOR 83 COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL CONCERNS "

106,Feeding Disorders,Child Development & Behavior ,1740,"FEEDING DISORDERS  IN INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Inadequate or disordered intake of food due to any of the following conditions: • Poor oral motor coordination. • Fatigue resulting from a chronic disease. • Lack of appetite. • Behavioral issues relating to parent-child interaction. • Pain associated with feeding. Children have feeding problems for various reasons includ- ing oral motor dysfunction, cardiopulmonary disorders leading to fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances causing pain, social or emotional issues, and problems with regulation. The common denominator, however, is usually food refusal. Infants and young children may refuse to eat if they find eating painful or frightening. They may have had unpleasant experiences (emotional or physiologic) associated with eat- ing, they may be depressed, or they may be engaged in a developmental conflict with the caregiver that is being played out in the arena of feeding. The infant may refuse to eat if the rhythm of the feeding experience with the caregiver is not harmonious. The child who has had an esophageal atresia repair and has a stricture may find eating uncomfortable. The very young infant with severe oral candidiasis may refuse to eat because of pain. The child who has had a choking experience associated with feeding may be terrified to eat (oral motor dysfunction or aspiration). The child who is forced to eat by a maltreating parent or an overzealous caregiver may refuse feeds. Children who have required nasogastric feedings or who have required periods of fasting and intravenous nutrition in the first 1–2 months of life are more likely to display food refusal behavior upon introduc- tion of oral feedings. Depression in children may be expressed through food refusal. Food refusal may develop when the infant’s cues around feeding are not interpreted correctly by the parent. The infant who needs to burp more frequently or who needs time between bites but instead is rushed will often passively refuse to eat. Some will be more active refusers, turning their heads away to avoid the feeder, spitting out food, or pushing away food. Chatoor and coworkers have proposed a developmental and interactive construct of the feeding experience. The stages through which the child normally progresses are establishment of homeostasis (0–2 months), attachment (2–6 months), and separation and individuation (6 months to 3 years). During the first stage, feeding can be accom- plished most easily when the parent allows the infant to determine the timing, amount, pacing, and preference of food intake. During the attachment phase, allowing the infant to control the feeding permits the parent to engage the infant in a positive manner. This paves the way for the separation and individuation phase. When a disturbance occurs in the parent-child relationship at any of these developmental levels, difficulty in feeding may ensue, with both the parent and the child contributing to the dysfunc- tional interaction. One of the most striking manifestations of food refusal occurs during the stage of separation and individuation. Conflict may arise if the parent seeks to dominate the child by intrusive and controlling feeding behavior at the same time the child is striving to achieve autonomy. The scenario then observed is of the parent forcing food on the child while the child refuses to eat. This often leads to extreme parental frustration and anger, and the child may be inadequately nourished and developmen- tally and emotionally thwarted. When the pediatrician is attempting to sort out the factors contributing to food refusal, it is essential first to obtain a complete history, including a social history. This should include information concerning the parents’ percep-   CHILD DEVELOPMENT & BEHAVIOR 85 tion of the child’s behavior and their expectations of the child. Second, a complete physical examination should be performed, with emphasis on oral-motor behavior and other clues suggesting neurologic, anatomic, or physiologic abnor- malities that could make feeding difficult. The child’s emo- tional state and developmental level must be determined. This is particularly important if there is concern about depression or a history of developmental delays. If evidence of oral-motor difficulty is suspected, evaluation by an occu- pational therapist is warranted. Third, the feeding interac- tion needs to be observed live, if possible. Finally, the physician needs to help the parents understand that infants and children may have different styles of eating and different food preferences and may refuse foods they do not like. This is not necessarily abnormal but reflects temperamental dif- ferences and variations in the child’s way of processing olfactory, gustatory, and tactile stimuli.  Management The goal of intervention is to identify factors contributing to the disturbance and to work to overcome them. The parents may be encouraged to view the child’s behavior differently and try not to impose their expectations and desires. Alter- natively, the child’s behavior may need to be modified so that the parents can provide adequate nurturing. When the chief complaint is failure to gain weight, a different approach is required. The differential diagnosis should include not only food refusal but also medical disor- ders and maltreatment. The most common reason for failure to gain weight is inadequate caloric intake. Excessive weight loss may be due to vomiting or diarrhea, to malabsorption, or to a combination of these factors. In this situation more extensive diagnostic evaluation may be needed. Laboratory studies may include a complete blood count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; urinalysis and urine culture; blood urea nitrogen; serum electrolytes and creatinine; and stool exam- ination for fat, occult blood, and ova and parasites. Some practitioners also include liver and thyroid profiles. Occa- sionally an assessment of swallowing function or evaluation for the presence of gastroesophageal reflux may be indicated. Because of the complexity of the problem, a team approach to the diagnosis and treatment of failure to thrive, or poor weight gain, may be most appropriate. The team should include a physician, nurse, social worker, and dietitian. Occupational and physical therapists, developmentalists, and psychologists may be required. The goals of treatment of the child with poor weight gain are to establish a normal pattern of weight gain and to establish better family functioning. Guidelines to accom- plishing these goals include the following: (1) establish a comprehensive diagnosis that considers all factors contribut- ing to poor weight gain; (2) monitor the feeding interaction and ensure appropriate weight gain; (3) monitor the devel- opmental progress of the child and the changes in the family dynamics that facilitate optimal weight gain and psychoso- cial development; and (4) provide support to the family as they seek to help the child.

107,Sleep Disorders,Child Development & Behavior ,3870,"SLEEP DISORDERS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Children younger than age 12 years: • Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that is viewed as a problem by the child or caregiver. • May be characterized by its severity, chronicity, frequency, and associated impairment in daytime function in the child or family. • May be due to a primary sleep disorder or occur in association with other sleep, medical, or psychiatric disorders.  Adolescents—difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or early morning awakening, or nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these problems. Sleep is a complex physiologic process influenced by intrin- sic biologic properties, temperament, cultural norms and expectations, and environmental conditions. Between 20% and 30% of children experience sleep disturbances at some point in the first 4 years of life. The percentage decreases to 10–12% in school-aged children. Sleep disorders fall into two categories. Dyssomnias refer to problems with initiating and maintaining sleep or to excessive sleepiness. Parasom- nias refer to abnormalities of arousal, partial arousal, and transitions between stages of sleep. Sleep is controlled by two different biologic clocks. The first is a circadian rhythm–daily sleep-wake cycle. The sec- ond is an ultradian rhythm that occurs several times per night—the stages of sleep. Sleep stages cycle every 50–60 minutes in infants to every 90 minutes in adolescents. The circadian clock is longer than 24 hours. Environmental cues entrain the sleep-wake cycle into a 24-hour cycle. The cues are light-dark, ambient temperature, core body temperature, noise, social interaction, hunger, pain, and hormone pro- duction. Without the ability to perceive these cues (ie,   CHAPTER 2 88 France KG et al: Fact, act, and tact: A three-stage approach to treating the sleep problems of infants and young children.

110,Temper Tantrums & Breath-holding Spells,Child Development & Behavior ,762,"TEMPER TANTRUMS &  BREATH-HOLDING SPELLS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Behavioral responses to stress, frustration, and loss of control.  Tantrum—child may throw him- or herself on the ground, kick, scream, or strike out at others.  Breath-holding spell—child engages in a prolonged expiration that is reflexive and may become pale or cyanotic.  Rule out underlying organic disease in children with breath-holding spells (eg, CNS abnormalities, Rett syndrome, seizures). 1. Temper Tantrums Temper tantrums are common between ages 12 months and 4 years, occurring about once a week in 50–80% of children in this age group. The child may throw him- or herself down, kick and scream, strike out at people or objects in the room, and hold his or her breath. These behaviors may be consid- ered normal as the young child seeks to achieve autonomy and mastery over the environment. They are often a reflec- tion of immaturity as the child strives to accomplish age- appropriate developmental tasks and meets with difficulty because of inadequate motor and language skills, impulsive- ness, or parental restrictions. In the home, these behaviors may be annoying. In public, they are embarrassing. Some children tolerate frustration well, are able to persevere at tasks, and cope easily with difficulties; others have a much greater problem dealing with experiences beyond their developmental level. Parents can minimize tantrums by understanding the child’s temperament and what he or she is trying to communicate. Parents must also be committed to supporting the child’s drive to master his or her feelings.  Management Appropriate intervention can provide an opportunity for enhancing the child’s growth. The tantrum is a loss of control on the child’s part that may be a frightening event and a blow to the child’s self-image. The parents and the physician need to view these behaviors within the child’s developmental context rather than from a negative, adver- sarial, angry perspective. Several suggestions can be offered to parents and physi- cians to help manage tantrums: 1. Minimize the need to say “no” by “child-proofing” the environment so that fewer restrictions need to be enforced. 2. Use distraction when frustration increases; direct the child to other, less frustrating activities; and reward the positive response. 3. Present options within the child’s capabilities so that he or she can achieve mastery and autonomy. 4. Fight only those battles that need to be won, and avoid those that arouse unnecessary conflict. 5. Do not abandon the preschool child when a tantrum occurs. Stay nearby during the episode without intrud- ing. A small child may need to be restrained. An older child can be asked to go to his or her room. Threats serve no purpose and should not be used. 6. Do not use negative terms when the tantrum is occur- ring. Instead, point out that the child is out of control and give praise when he or she regains control. 7. Never let a child hurt him- or herself or others. 8. Do not “hold a grudge” after the tantrum is over, but do not grant the child’s demands that led to the tantrum. 9. Seek to maintain an environment that provides positive reinforcement for desired behavior. Do not overreact to undesired behavior, but set reasonable limits and pro- vide responsible direction for the child. 10. Approximately 5–20% of young children have severe temper tantrums that are frequent and disruptive. Such tantrums may result from a disturbance in the parent- child interaction, poor parenting skills, lack of limit- setting, and permissiveness. They may be part of a larger behavioral or developmental disorder or may emerge under adverse socioeconomic conditions, in circum- stances of maternal depression and family dysfunction, or when the child is in poor health. Referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist is appropriate while the pediatrician con- tinues to support and work with the family. 2. Breath-Holding Spells Whereas temper tantrums can be frustrating to parents, breath-holding spells can be terrifying. The name for this behavior may be a misnomer in that it connotes prolonged inspiration. In fact, breath-holding occurs during expiration and is reflexive—not volitional—in nature. It is a paroxys-   CHILD DEVELOPMENT & BEHAVIOR 89 mal event occurring in 0.1–5% of healthy children from age 6 months to 6 years. The spells usually start during the first year of life, often in response to anger or a mild injury. The child is provoked or surprised, starts to cry—briefly or for a considerable time—and then falls silent in the expiratory phase of respiration. This is followed by a color change. Spells have been described as either pallid (acyanotic) or cyanotic, with the latter usually associated with anger and the former with an injury such as a fall. The spell may resolve spontaneously, or the child may lose consciousness. In severe cases, the child may become limp and progress to opisthoto- nos, body jerks, and urinary incontinence. Only rarely does a spell proceed to asystole or a seizure.  Management For the child with frequent spells, underlying disorders such as seizures, orthostatic hypotension, obstructive sleep apnea, abnormalities of the CNS, tumors, familial dysautonomia, and Rett syndrome need to be considered. An association exists among breath-holding spells, pica, and iron-deficiency anemia. These conditions can be ruled out on the basis of the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies. Once it has been determined that the child is healthy, the focus of treatment is behavioral. Parents should be taught to handle the spells in a matter-of-fact manner and monitor the child for any untoward events. The reality is that parents cannot completely protect the child from upsetting and frustrating experiences and probably should not try to do so. Just as in temper tantrums, parents need to help the child control his or her responses to frustration. Parents need to be careful not to be too permissive and submit to the child’s every whim for fear the child might have a spell. If loss of consciousness occurs, the child should be placed on his or her side to protect against head injury and aspira- tion. Maintaining a patent oral airway is essential, but cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be avoided. There are no prophylactic medications. Atropine, 0.01 mg/kg given subcutaneously, has been used with some benefit in spells accompanied by bradycardia or asystole. Breningstall GN: Breath holding spells.

111,Well Child Surveillance & Screening,Child Development & Behavior ,2621,"WELL CHILD SURVEILLANCE & SCREENING The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently pub- lished guidelines for surveillance and screening at well child visits. Surveillance is a procedure for recognizing children at risk for a developmental disorder and involves asking parents if they have concerns about their child’s development. The PEDS (Pediatric Evaluation of Developmental Status) can be used for this purpose. Screening involves use of a standard- ized tool to clarify identified risk. An evaluation would be done by a specialist and would involve a more definitive evaluation of a child’s development. Surveillance should occur at all well child visits. Screen- ing of development should occur at 9, 18, and 30 months. Because a 30-month visit is not part of the standard well child visit schedule and may not be reimbursed, screening may occur at 24 months instead. It is also recommended that autism-specific screening should occur at the 18-month visit. Clinicians should keep in mind that if they are administering a screen because they are concerned and the child passes the screen, they should still schedule an early follow-up visit to ensure that appropriate progress has been made and that there are no further concerns. Although an autism-specific screen was only recom- mended at the 18-month visit in the AAP guidelines, the Autism Workgroup of the AAP has recommended a second autism-specific screen at 24–30 months in order to pick up children missed at the 18-month screen. Because the average age of regression is 20 months, some children may be missed by a single screen at 18 months. Screening for autism earlier than 14 months, with the tools that are currently available, yields too many false-positive results. Development of screen- ing tools for children younger than 18 months are ongoing. Implementation of screening requires planning for timing of screening administration during office visits, defining the process for referral, and designing handouts prior to begin- ning screening. Aside from the important process of seeking to optimize the child’s development with the use of these screen- ings they also demonstrate to the parent the interest their caretaker has not only for the child’s physical wellbeing but also for the child’s developmental and psychosocial wellbeing. Parents of children who received a developmental assessment expressed greater satisfaction with their care provider.

112,Developmental Disorders,Child Development & Behavior ,213,"DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS Developmental disorders include abnormalities in one or more aspects of development, such as verbal, motor, visual-spatial, attentional, and social abilities. These problems are diagnosed by comparing the child’s performance level with norms accu- mulated from observation and testing of children of the same age. Problems with development are often noted by parents when a child does not meet typical motor and language milestones. Developmental disorders may also include difficul- ties with behavior or attention. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder. ADHD occurs in 2–10% of school-aged children and may occur in combination with a variety of other learning or developmental issues. Mild developmental disorders are often not noted until the child is of school age. Many biologic and psychosocial factors may influence a child’s performance on developmental tests. In the assess- ment of the child, it is important to document adverse psychosocial factors, such as neglect or poverty, which can negatively influence developmental progress. Many of the biologic factors that influence development are genetic and are discussed throughout this section. Evaluation The neurodevelopmental evaluation must focus on (1) defin- ing the child’s level of developmental abilities in a variety of domains, including language, motor, visual-spatial, atten- tional, and social abilities; (2) attempting to determine the etiology for the child’s developmental delays; and (3) planning a treatment program. These objectives are best achieved by a multidisciplinary team that includes the physician, a psychol- ogist, a speech or language therapist, an occupational thera- pist, and an educational specialist. The psychologist will usu- ally carry out standardized testing of intellectual ability appropriate to the child’s age. The motor and language spe- cialists will also carry out clinical testing to document the deficits in their areas and to organize a treatment program. The educational specialist will usually carry out academic testing for the school-aged child and plan a course of special education support through the school. The physician is usu- ally the integrator of the information from the team and must also obtain a detailed medical and developmental history and conduct the physical and neurologic examinations. Medical &  Neurodevelopmental Examination The medical history should begin with pregnancy, labor, and delivery to identify conditions that might compromise the child’s CNS function. The physician must ask the child’s parents about prenatal exposures to toxins, medications, alcohol, drugs, smoking, and infections; maternal chronic illness; complications of pregnancy or delivery and neonatal course. Problems such as failure to thrive, chronic illnesses, hospitalizations, and abuse can interfere significantly with normal development. Major illnesses or hospitalizations should be discussed. Any CNS problems, such as trauma, infection, or encephalitis should be documented. The pres- ence of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes or phenylketo- nuria, and exposure to environmental toxins such as lead should be determined. Chronic diseases such as chronic otitis media, hyper- or hypothyroidism, and chronic renal failure can interfere with normal development. The presence of motor or vocal tics, seizures, or sleep disturbances should be documented. In addition, parents should be questioned about any motor, cognitive, or behavioral regression. The physician should review and document the child’s temperament, difficulties with feeding, and subsequent developmental milestones. The child’s difficulties with tan- trums, poor attention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, or aggres- sion should be documented. A detailed history of school-related events should be recorded, including previous special education support, evaluations through the school, history of repeating grades, difficulties with specific academic areas, problems with peers, and the teacher’s impressions of the child’s difficulties, particularly related to attentional problems, impulsivity, or hyperactivity. Input from teachers can be invaluable and should be sought prior to the evaluation. Perhaps the most important aspect of the medical history is a detailed family history of learning strengths and weak- nesses, emotional or behavioral problems, learning disabili- ties, mental retardation, or psychiatric disorders. Parental learning strengths and weaknesses, temperament difficulties, or attentional problems may be passed on to the child. For instance, dyslexia (deficits in decoding skills that result in reading difficulties) is often inherited. The neurodevelopmental examination should include a careful assessment of dysmorphic features such as epicanthal folds, palpebral fissure size, shape of the philtrum, low-set or posteriorly rotated ears, prominent ear pinnae, unusual der- matoglyphics (eg, a single palmar crease), hyperextensibility of the joints, syndactyly, clinodactyly, or other unusual features. A detailed physical and neurologic examination needs to be carried out with an emphasis on both soft and hard neurologic findings. Soft signs can include motor incoordination, which can relate to handwriting problems and academic delays in written language or drawing. Visual motor coordination abil- ities can be assessed by having the child write, copy designs, or draw a person. The child’s growth parameters, including height, weight, and head circumference, need to be assessed, along with hearing and visual acuity. Cranial nerve abnormalities and oral-motor coordination problems need to be noted. The   CHILD DEVELOPMENT & BEHAVIOR 91 examiner should watch closely for motor or vocal tics. Both fine and gross motor abilities should be assessed. Dyspraxia (motor planning difficulties or imitating complex motor movements) and disorders of fine motor coordination are fairly common. Tandem walking, one-foot balancing, and coordinating a skip may often show surprising abnormali- ties. Tremors can be noted when watching a child stack blocks or draw. The developmental aspects of the examination can include an assessment of auditory processing and perceptual ability with simple tasks, such as twofold to fivefold direc- tions, assessing right and left directionality, memory for a series of spoken words or digit span, and comprehension of a graded paragraph. In assessing expressive language abili- ties, the examiner should look for difficulties with word retrieval, formulation, and articulation, and adequacy of vocabulary. Visual-perceptual abilities can be assessed by simple visual memory tasks, puzzles, or object assembly, and evaluating the child’s ability to decode words or organize math problems. Visual-motor integration and coordination can be assessed again with handwriting, design copying, and drawing a person. Throughout the assessment the clinician should pay special attention to the child’s ability to focus attention and concentrate, and to other aspects of behavior such as evidence of depression or anxiety. Additional questionnaires and checklists—such as the Child Behavior Checklist by Achenbach; ADHD scales such as the Conners’ Parent/Teacher Rating Scale; and the Swan- son, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire-IV, which includes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for ADHD—can be used to help with this assessment. Referral of family to community resources is critical, as is a medical home (described earlier in the chapter).

113,Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,Child Development & Behavior ,2620,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a com- mon neurodevelopmental disorder that may affect 2–10% of school-aged children and may persist into adolescence and adulthood. It is associated with a triad of symptoms: impul- sivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. DSM-IV-TR has described three ADHD subtypes: hyperactive-impulsive, inattentive, and combined. To be classified according to either subtype, the child must exhibit six or more of the symptoms listed in Table 2–5. The majority of children with ADHD have a combined type with symptoms of inattention as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Although symptoms begin in early child- hood, they can diminish between ages 10 and 25 years. Hyperactivity declines more quickly, and impulsivity and inattentiveness often persist into adolescence and adulthood. ADHD may be combined with other psychiatric conditions, such as mood disorder in approximately 20% of patients, conduct disorders in 20%, and oppositional defiant disorder in up to 40%. Up to 25% of children with ADHD seen in a referral clinic have tics or Tourette syndrome. Conversely, well over 50% of individuals with Tourette syndrome also have ADHD. ADHD has a substantial genetic component. Several can- didate genes have been identified, although there is strong evidence that ADHD is a disorder involving multiple genes. ADHD is also associated with a variety of genetic disorders related to developmental disorders, including fragile X syn- drome, Williams syndrome, Angelman syndrome, XXY syn- drome (Klinefelter syndrome), and Turner syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is also strongly associated with ADHD. CNS trauma, CNS infections, prematurity, and a difficult neonatal course with brain injury can also be associ- ated with later ADHD. Metabolic problems such as hyperthy- Table 2–5.

115,Autism Spectrum Disorders,Child Development & Behavior ,1757,"AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Three core deficits: • Qualitative impairments in communication • Qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction • Presence of stereotypic, restrictive, and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Autism is a neurologic disorder characterized by (1) qualitative impairments in social interaction; (2) qualitative impair- ments in communication; and (3) restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Autism is currently grouped under the Pervasive Develop- mental Disorders in the DSM-IV with Asperger Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Rett Syndrome. Asperger disorder is characterized by impairment in social interaction and restricted interest/repetitive behaviors. Indi- viduals with Asperger disorder should not have significant delays in cognitive, language, or self-help skills. Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified is character- ized by impairment in reciprocal social interaction along with impairment in communication skills, or restricted interest or repetitive behaviors. Children with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified do not meet full criteria for autism due to mild or atypical symptoms. Childhood disintegrative disorder is characterized by typical development for at least 2 years followed by a regression in at least two of the following three areas: social interaction, communication, and behavior (characterized by restricted interests or repetitive behaviors.) Rett syndrome is a genetic syndrome caused by a mutation on the X chromosome that is characterized by regression in skills in the first year of life. Table 2–6 lists the DSM-IV-TR criteria for diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorders are relatively common, occur- ring in approximately 1 in 150 children. Males are overrepre- sented 3–4:1, with reports as high as 9.5:1 (especially when higher functioning individuals are included). No known etiology can be found in 80–90% of cases. A genetic syn- drome such as fragile X syndrome or chromosome 15q duplication is found in 10–20% of cases. There is a strong familial component. Parents of one child with autism of unknown etiology have a 2–9% chance of having a second child with autism. The concordance rate among monozygotic twins is high, and there is an increased incidence of speech, language, reading, attention, and affective disorders in family members of children with autism.  Evaluation & Management Children with autism are often not diagnosed until age 3–4 years, when their disturbances in reciprocal social interaction Table 2–6.

The term retardation was first used in an educational context to describe educationally compro- mised students. Indeed, during the early 20th century, educators and psychologists struggled to identify the causes of the problems these students encountered. Inter- estingly, their “differential diagnoses” included biologic, environmental, and emotional etiologies, not dissimilar to those we deal with in the 21st century. In addition, it was—and continues to be—acknowledged that the term mental retardation and earlier terms such as idiocy, feeble- mindedness, and mental deficiency are pejorative, demean- ing, and dehumanizing. Recently, a rethinking of the construct of disability has emerged that shifts the focus from limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive capability (a person-centered trait) to a human phenomenon with its source in biologic or social factors and contexts. The current view is a social-ecological conception of disability that articulates the role of disease or disorder leading to impairments in structure and function, limitations in activities, and restriction in participation in personal and environmental interactions. The term intellec- tual disability, which is consistent with this broader view, is increasingly being used and reflects an appreciation of the humanness and potential of the individual. The diagnostic criteria currently remain the same; however, the construct and context has changed. Having noted this, it is important to acknowledge that significant delays in the development of language, motor skills, attention, abstract reasoning, visual-spatial skills, and academic or vocational achievements are associated with "
117,Intellectual Disability/Mental Retardation,Child Development & Behavior ,4108,"intellectual disability/mental retardation (ID/MR). Deficits on standardized testing in cognitive and adaptive functioning greater than two standard deviations below the mean for the population are considered to fall in the range of ID/MR (Table 2–7). The most common way of reporting the results of these tests is by using an intelligence quotient. The intelli- gence quotient is a statistically derived number reflecting the ratio of age-appropriate cognitive function and the child’s actual level of cognitive function. A number of accepted standardized measurement tools, such as the Wechsler Intel- ligence Scale for Children, third edition, can be used to assess these capacities. To receive a diagnosis of ID/MR a child must not only have an intelligence quotient of less than 70, but also must demonstrate adaptive skills more than two standard deviations below the mean. Adaptive function refers to the child’s ability to function in his or her environment and can be measured by a parent or teacher interview recorded using an instrument such as the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. The prevalence of ID/MR is approximately 3% in the general population, although some states have reported a prevalence of less than 2%. Mild levels of ID/MR are more common and more likely to have a sociocultural cause than are more severe levels. Poverty, deprivation, or a lack of exposure to a stimulating environment can contribute to developmental delays and poor performance on standardized tests. In addition, physical problems such as hearing loss, blindness, and brain trauma can lead to developmental delays Table 2–7. Categories of intellectual  disability/mental retardation (ID/MR).

DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES How, where, why, and when adolescents seek health care depends on ability to pay, distance to health care facilities, availability of transportation, accessibility of services, time away from school, and privacy. Many common teenage health problems, such as unintended pregnancy and the need for contraception; STIs; and substance abuse, depression, and other emotional problems, have moral, ethical, and legal impli- cations. Teenagers are often reluctant to confide in their par- ents for fear of punishment or disapproval. Recognizing this reality, health care providers have established specialized pro- grams such as teenage family planning clinics, drop-in centers, STI clinics, hotlines, and adolescent clinics. Establishing a trusting and confidential relationship with adolescents is basic to meeting their health care needs. Patients who sense that the physician will inform their parents about a confidential prob- lem may lie or fail to disclose information essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. "
125,Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services,Child Development & Behavior ,1464,"GUIDELINES FOR ADOLESCENT  PREVENTIVE SERVICES The American Medical Association guidelines for adolescent preventive services and the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents cover health screening and guidance, immunization, and health care delivery. The goals of these guidelines are (1) to deter adolescents from participating in behaviors that jeopardize health; (2) to detect physical, emo- tional, and behavioral problems early and intervene promptly; (3) to reinforce and encourage behaviors that promote health- ful living; and (4) to provide immunization against infectious diseases. The guidelines recommend that adolescents between ages 11 and 21 years have annual routine health visits. Health services should be developmentally appropriate and culturally sensitive, and confidentiality between patient and physician should be ensured. RELATING TO THE ADOLESCENT PATIENT Adolescence is one of the physically healthiest periods in life. The challenge of caring for adolescents lies not in managing complex organic disease, but in accommodating the cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial growth that influences health behavior. How the physician initially approaches the adolescent may determine the success or failure of the visit. The physician should behave simply and honestly, without an authoritarian or excessively profes- sional manner. Because the self-esteem of many young adolescents is fragile, the physician must be careful not to overpower and intimidate the patient. To establish a com- fortable and trusting relationship, the physician should strive to present the image of an ordinary person who has special training and skills. Because individuals vary in the onset and termination of puberty, chronologic age may be a poor indicator of physi- cal, physiologic, and emotional development. In communi- cating with an adolescent, the physician must be sensitive to the patient’s developmental level, recognizing that outward appearance and chronologic age may not give an accurate assessment of cognitive development. Working with teenagers can be emotionally draining. Adolescents have a unique ability to identify hidden emo- tional vulnerabilities. The physician who has a personal need to control patients or foster dependency may be disap- pointed in caring for teenagers. Because teenagers are con- sumed with their own emotional needs, they rarely provide the physician with the ego rewards that younger or older patients do. The physician should be sensitive to the issue of counter- transference, the emotional reaction elicited in the physician by the adolescent. How the physician relates to the adoles- cent patient often depends on the physician’s personal char- acteristics. This is especially true of physicians who treat families that are experiencing parent-adolescent conflicts. It is common for young physicians to overidentify with the teenage patient and for older physicians to see the conflict from the parents’ perspective. Overidentification with the parents is readily sensed by the teenager, who is likely to view the physician as just another authority figure who cannot understand the prob- lems of being a teenager. Assuming a parental-authoritarian role may jeopardize the establishment of a working relation- ship with the patient. In the case of the young physician, overidentification with the teenager may cause the parents to become defensive about their parenting role and discount the physician’s experience and ability. THE SETTING Adolescents respond positively to settings and services that communicate sensitivity to their age. A pediatrician’s waiting room with toddlers’ toys and infant-sized examination tables makes adolescent patients feel they have outgrown the prac- tice. A waiting room filled with geriatric or pregnant patients can also make a teenager feel out of place. It is not uncommon to see a teenage patient who has been brought to the office against his or her wishes, especially for evaluations of drug and alcohol use, parent-child conflict, school failure, depression, or a suspected eating disorder.    ADOLESCENCE 109 what changes to expect. Figure 3–3 shows the relationship between height, penis and testes development, and pubic hair growth in the male, and Figure 3–4 shows the relation- ship between height, breast development, menstruation, and pubic hair growth in the female. Although teenagers may not admit that they are interested in this subject, they are usually attentive when it is raised. This discussion is particularly useful in counseling teenagers who lag behind their peers in physical development. Because teenagers are sensitive about their changing bodies, it is useful to comment during the examination: “Your heart sounds fine. I feel a small lump under your right breast. This is very common during puberty in boys. It is called gynecomastia and should disappear in 6 months to a year. Don’t worry, you are not turning into a girl.” If a teenage girl has not been sexually active and has no gynecologic complaints or abnormalities, a pelvic examina- tion is usually not necessary until about age 18 years. The following are indications for a pelvic examination in a younger teenage girl: 1. A history of sexual intercourse. (The pelvic examination should be done for purposes of contraceptive counseling and to rule out STI.) 2. Abnormal vaginal discharge. 3. Menstrual irregularities. 4. Suspicion of anatomic abnormalities, such as imperfo- rate hymen. 5. Pelvic pain. 6. Patient request for an examination.

135,Behavior & Psychological Health,Adolescence ,539,"BEHAVIOR & PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH It is not unusual for adolescents to seek medical attention for seemingly minor complaints. In early adolescence, teenagers may worry about normal developmental changes such as gynecomastia. They may present with vague symptoms, but have a hidden agenda of concerns about pregnancy or an STI. Adolescents with emotional disorders often present with somatic symptoms such as abdominal pain, headaches, dizziness, syncope, fatigue, sleep problems, and chest pain that appear to have no biologic cause. The emotional basis of such complaints may be varied: somatoform disorder, depression, or stress and anxiety. PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGIC SYMPTOMS  & CONVERSION REACTIONS The most common somatoform disorder of adolescence is conversion disorder or conversion reaction. (A conversion reaction is a psychophysiologic process in which unpleasant feelings, especially anxiety, depression, and guilt, are com- municated through a physical symptom.) Psychophysiologic symptoms result when anxiety activates the autonomic ner- vous system, causing tachycardia, hyperventilation, and vasoconstriction. The emotional feeling may be threatening or unacceptable to the individual, who expresses it as a physical symptom rather than verbally. The process is unconscious, and the anxiety or unpleasant feeling is dissi- pated by the somatic symptom. The degree to which the conversion symptom lessens anxiety, depression, or the unpleasant feeling is referred to as primary gain. Conversion symptoms not only diminish unpleasant feelings but also release the adolescent from conflict or an uncomfortable situation. This is called secondary gain. Secondary gain may intensify the symptoms, especially with increased attention from concerned parents and friends. Adolescents with con- version symptoms tend to have overprotective parents and become increasingly dependent on their parents as the symptom becomes a major focus of concern in the family.  Clinical Findings Symptoms may appear at times of stress. Nervous, gas- trointestinal, and cardiovascular symptoms are common and include paresthesias, anesthesia, paralysis, dizziness, syn- cope, hyperventilation, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomit- ing. Specific symptoms may reflect existing or previous illness (eg, pseudoseizures in adolescents with epilepsy) or modeling of a close relative’s symptom (eg, chest pain in a boy whose grandfather died of a heart attack). Conversion symptoms are more common in girls than in boys. Although they occur in patients from all socioeco- nomic levels, the complexity of the symptom may vary with the sophistication and cognitive level of the patient.  Differential Diagnosis History and physical findings are usually inconsistent with a physical cause of symptoms. Conversion symptoms occur most frequently during stress and in the presence of individ- uals meaningful to the patient. The common personality traits of these patients include egocentricity, emotional labil- ity, and dramatic and attention-seeking behaviors. Conversion reactions must be differentiated from hypo- chondriasis, which is a preoccupation with developing or having a serious illness despite medical reassurance that there is no evidence of disease. Over time, the fear of one disease may give way to concern about another. In contrast to patients with conversion symptoms, who seem relieved if an organic cause is considered, patients with hypochondria- sis become more anxious when such a cause is considered. Malingering is uncommon during adolescence. The malingering patient consciously and intentionally fabricates false or exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms. Such patients are motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work, evading criminal prosecution, obtaining drugs, or obtaining financial compensation. These patients may be hostile and aloof. Parents of patients with conversion disorders and malingering have a similar reaction to illness. They have an unconscious psychological need to have sick children and reinforce their child’s behavior. Somatic delusions are physical symptoms, often bizarre, that accompany other signs of mental illness. Examples are visual or auditory hallucinations, delusions, incoherence or loosening of associations, rapid shifts of affect, and confusion.  Treatment The physician must emphasize from the outset that both physical and emotional causes of the symptom will be consid- ered. The relationship between physical causes of emotional pain and emotional causes of physical pain should be described to the family, using examples such as stress causing an ulcer or making a severe headache worse. The patient should be encouraged to understand that the symptom may persist and that at least a short-term goal is to continue normal daily activities. Medication is rarely helpful. If the family will accept it, psychological referral is often the best initial step toward psychotherapy. If the family resists psychiatric or psychological referral, the pediatrician may need to begin to    CHAPTER 3 118 necessary cognitive capacity, study habits, concentration, motivation, interest, and emotional focus. Academic failure presenting at adolescence has a broad differential: 1. Limited intellectual abilities 2. Specific learning disabilities 3. Depression or emotional problems 4. Physical causes such as visual or hearing problems 5. Excessive school absenteeism secondary to chronic dis- ease such as asthma or neurologic dysfunction 6. Lack of ability to concentrate 7. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 8. Lack of motivation 9. Drug and alcohol problems Each of these causes must be explored. Evaluation requires a careful history, physical examination, and appro- priate laboratory tests, as well as standardized educational and psychological testing.  Treatment Management must be individualized to address specific needs, foster strengths, and implement a feasible program. For children with specific learning disabilities, an individual prescription for regular and special education courses, teach- ers, and extracurricular activities is important. Counseling helps these adolescents gain coping skills, raise self-esteem, and develop socialization skills. If the patient has hyperactiv- ity or attention-deficit disorder along with poor ability to concentrate, a trial of stimulant medication (eg, methyl- phenidate or dextroamphetamine) may be useful. If the teenager appears depressed or if other serious emotional problems are uncovered, psychological evaluation should be recommended.

140,Breast Disorders,Adolescence ,1812,"BREAST DISORDERS The breast examination should become part of the routine physical examination in girls as soon as breast budding occurs. The preadolescent thus comes to accept breast examination as a routine part of health care, and the procedure serves as an opportunity to offer reassurance about patient concerns. The breast examination begins with inspection of the breasts for symmetry and Tanner or sexual maturity rating (SMR) stage. Asymmetrical breast develop- ment is common in young adolescents, and is generally transient, although 25% of women may continue to have some degree of asymmetry into adulthood. Organic causes of breast asymmetry include unilateral breast hypoplasia, amastia, absence of the pectoralis major muscle, and unilat- eral virginal hypertrophy (massive enlargement of the breast during puberty). Palpation of the breasts is performed with the patient supine and the ipsilateral arm placed behind the head. The examiner palpates the breast tissue with the flat of the fingers in concentric circles from the sternum, clavicle, and axilla in to the areola. The areola should be compressed gently to check for discharge. Instructions for breast self-examination and its purpose can be given to older adolescents during this portion of the physical examination, and the patient older than 18 years should be encouraged to begin monthly self-examination after each menstrual flow. Because the vast majority of breast lesions in teens are benign, teaching younger adolescents breast self-examination may lead to unnecessary anxiety and overconcern with normal variants. BREAST MASSES Most breast masses in adolescents are benign (Table 3–1). Rare malignancies of adolescent girls include hemangiosar- coma, rhabdomyosarcoma, ductal carcinoma, cystosarcoma phyllodes, and metastatic tumor.  Table 3–1. Breast masses in adolescent females.  Common Fibroadenoma Fibrocystic changes Breast cysts (including retroareolar cysts) Breast abscess or mastitis Fat necrosis (after trauma) Less common or rare (benign) Lymphangioma Hemangioma Juvenile papillomatosis Giant fibroadenoma Neurofibromatosis Nipple adenoma or keratoma Mammary duct ectasia Intramammary lymph node Lipoma Hematoma Hamartoma Galactocele Rare (malignant potential) Adenocarcinoma Juvenile secretory carcinoma Fibrosarcoma Fibrous histiocytoma Cystosarcoma phyllodes Intraductal carcinoma Rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma Lymphosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma Metastatic cancer   CHAPTER 3 120 reported only in girls, usually prepubertally. Ductal ectasia, with dilation of the mammary ducts, fibrosis, and inflamma- tion, is benign and can present with bloody or brown nipple discharge. Bloody discharge with a mass can also result from papillomatosis, which has malignant potential. Galactorrhea may be present postpartum and after spon- taneous or induced abortions. Numerous prescribed and illicit drugs are possible causes (Table 3–3). Stimulation of the intercostal nerves (following surgery or due to herpes zoster infection), stimulation of the nipples, central nervous system disorders (hypothalamic injury), or emotional dis- tress may produce galactorrhea.  Clinical Findings TSH and serum prolactin levels should be determined. Ele- vated TSH confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Ele- vated prolactin and normal TSH, often accompanied by amenorrhea, in the absence of medications suggest a hypotha- lamic or pituitary tumor, and a magnetic resonance imaging scan is indicated. When the prolactin level is normal, uncom- mon causes such as adrenal, renal, or ovarian tumors should be considered. Males with a negative workup and normal puberty need to be followed intensively. Males with elevated prolactin levels require a magnetic resonance imaging scan every 12–18 months even if the galactorrhea resolves, because of the significant risk of a small pituitary adenoma that may become apparent with serial examinations.  Treatment Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Prolactinomas may be removed surgically or suppressed with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine. Bromocriptine may also be beneficial to some amenorrheic females with normal serum prolactin levels. The female with a negative workup and persistent galactorrhea may be followed with menstrual history and serum prolactin level every 6–12 months. In many cases, symptoms resolve spontaneously and no diag- nosis is made. The female with an elevated serum prolactin concentration but negative prolactinoma workup may be treated with bromocriptine if her symptoms are bothersome or may be observed with a magnetic resonance imaging scan every 1–2 years for several years. GYNECOMASTIA Gynecomastia is a common concern of male adolescents, 60– 70% of whom have transient subareolar breast tissue during SMR stages 2 and 3. Causes include testosterone-estrogen imbalance, increased serum prolactin level, and abnormal serum protein binding levels.  Clinical Findings In type I idiopathic gynecomastia, the adolescent has a unilateral (20% bilateral) tender, firm mass beneath the areola. Generalized breast enlargement is classified as type II. Pseudogynecomastia refers to excessive fat tissue or promi- nent pectoralis muscles.  Differential Diagnosis Gynecomastia may be drug-induced (Table 3–4). Testicular, adrenal, or pituitary tumors, Klinefelter syndrome, primary hypogonadism, thyroid or hepatic dysfunction, or malnutri- tion may also be associated with gynecomastia (Table 3–5). Onset of gynecomastia in late (rather than early or middle) adolescence is more likely to be indicative of organic disease.  Treatment If gynecomastia is idiopathic, reassurance about the common and benign nature of the process can be given. Resolution may take up to 2 years. Surgery is reserved for those with significant psychological trauma or severe breast enlargement. ACOG Committee Opinion: Breast concerns in the adolescent.

The short- and long-term health, social, emotional, legal, and behavioral consequences of substance abuse are particularly damaging during child- hood and adolescence. Not only does early substance use portend chronic, severe polysubstance abuse later in life, but substance use may also compromise physical, cogni- tive, and psychosocial aspects of adolescent development if this maladaptive behavior becomes the preferred response to environmental stressors. Substance abuse tends to be a chronic, progressive disease. The first or initiation stage—from nonuser to user—is such a common feature of becoming an American adult that many authorities call it normative behavior. At this stage, substance use is typically limited to experimen- tation with tobacco or alcohol (so-called gateway sub- stances). During adolescence, young people are expected to establish an independent, autonomous identity. They try out a variety of behaviors within the safety of their family circles and peer groups. This process often involves experi- mentation with psychoactive substances, usually in cultur- ally acceptable circumstances. Progression to the second or continuation stage of substance abuse is a nonnormative risk behavior with the potential to compromise adolescent development. The American Psychiatric Association has outlined criteria that can be used to judge the severity of substance use that progresses beyond the experimentation stage to substance abuse or substance dependency (the former being more severe). Maintenance and progression within a class of substances (eg, from beer to liquor) and progression across classes of substances (eg, from alcohol to marijuana) represent the third and fourth stages of substance abuse. Individuals at these stages are polysub- stance abusers, and most manifest one or more of the symptoms of dependency such as tolerance or withdrawal. The transition from one stage to the next is typically a cyclic process of regression, cessation, and relapse. Common symptoms and physiologic effects of intoxication (which can occur at any stage) and withdrawal (a symptom of dependency) for the major classes of substances are pre- sented in Tables 4–1 and 4–2.

159,Scope of the Problem,Adolescence ,3068,"SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM The best source of information about the prevalence of substance abuse among American children and adolescents is the annual Monitoring the Future Study, which tracks health-related behaviors in a sample of 50,000 8th, 10th, and 12th graders in more than 400 schools across the United States. This study probably understates the magnitude of the problem of substance abuse because it excludes two high- risk adolescent groups—school dropouts and runaways. Although the exclusion of these youngsters may minimize prevalence estimates only moderately for the entire popula- tion, errors in estimating drug use among subgroups with high rates of school dropout (eg, urban minority youths) are thought to be substantial. Data from this survey and others show that alcohol is the most frequently abused substance in our society. Experimentation with alcohol typically begins in or before middle school; is more common among boys than girls; and is most common among whites, less common among Hispanics and Native Americans, and least common Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

The use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs doubles from 8th grade to 12th grade. The rate of alcohol and cigarette use more than triples from adolescence (12– 17 years) to young adulthood (18–25 years). The preva- lence of marijuana use among 12th graders in 2006 was 32%. In the past decade, LSD, ecstasy, and methamphet- amine use decreased but cocaine use increased. The most disturbing trend among adolescents is the recreational use of prescription medications, particularly psychotherapeutic agents. Studies indicate that the rise and fall in use of a substance is heralded by changes in the perceived risks and benefits of using the substance. The use of inhalants had been rising until 2006, when both experience and educa- tional efforts resulted in a perception of these substances as being “dangerous.” Becker CE et al: Glue sniffing polyneuropathy: An under recog- nized aspect of a public health hazard.

163,Morbidity Data,Adolescence ,2854,"MORBIDITY DATA Use and abuse of alcohol or other mood-altering substances is tightly linked with the leading causes of death among adoles- cents in the United States (ie, motor vehicle accidents, unin- tentional injury, homicide, and suicide). Substance abuse is also associated with physical and sexual abuse. Up to two thirds of sexual assaults and acquaintance or date rapes are linked to alcohol or other drug use. Drug use and abuse also contribute to other high-risk behaviors, such as unsafe sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, and sexually transmitted dis- eases. The use of drugs during periods of low self-esteem and depression increases the risk of suicide. Adolescents are also involved with selling of drugs. The risks associated with tobacco, alcohol, and cocaine are listed in Table 4–2. Less well known are the long- and short- term adolescent morbidities connected with the currently most popular illicit drugs, marijuana and ecstasy. The active ingredient in marijuana, δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), transiently causes tachycardia, mild hypertension, and bron- chodilation. Regular use can cause lung changes similar to those seen in tobacco smokers. Heavy use decreases fertility in both sexes and immunocompetence. It is also associated with Anabolic steroidsa Bind steroid receptor Stacking: use many types  simultaneously; pyramid- ing: increase dosage Increased muscle bulk, strength,  endurance, increased drive,  hypogonadism, low sperm count,  gynecomastia, decreased libido,  virilization, irregular menses,  hepatitis, early epiphysial clo- sure, aggressiveness Drug craving, dysphoria, irri- tability, depression Tendon rupture, car- diomyopathy, athero- sclerosis, peliosis  hepatis (orally active  C17 derivatives of  testosterone are  especially hepato- toxic) aDespite conventional assumptions, scientific studies show that anabolic steroids do not improve aerobic athletic performance and improve strength only in  athletes trained in weight lifting before they begin using steroids who continue to train and consume a high-protein diet.

(Continued) Substance Pharmacology Intoxication Withdrawal Chronic Use   CHAPTER 4 142 damage to the hippocampus and basal ganglia, which causes abnormalities of cognition, learning, coordination, and mem- ory. It is possible that heavy marijuana use is the cause of the so-called amotivational syndrome, characterized by inatten- tion to environmental stimuli and impaired goal-directed thinking and behavior. Analysis of confiscated marijuana has shown increasing THC concentration and adulteration with other substances. Ecstasy is gaining in both popularity and accessibility among adolescents. Chronic use destroys the serotonin system of the brain and is associated with progressive decline of immediate and delayed memory and with alterations in mood, sleep, and appetite that may be permanent. Even first- time users may develop frank psychosis indistinguishable from schizophrenia. Irreversible cardiomyopathy, noncardio- genic pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension may occur with long-term use. Acute overdose can cause hyper- thermia and multiorgan system failure. A growing problem is the abuse of prescribed and over- the-counter (OTC) medications by adolescents. Medication used in the medical management of chronic pain, depres- sion, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can be drugs of abuse either by the patients or by those they supply with the drug. Environmental and prenatal exposure to abused sub- stances carries health risks. Parental tobacco smoking is associated with low birth weight in newborns, sudden infant death syndrome, bronchiolitis, asthma, otitis media, and fire-related injuries. Paternal use of marijuana during preg- nancy is associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. In utero exposure to cocaine and alcohol may produce fetal malformations, intrauterine growth restriction, and brain injury.

164,Supplement Use & Abuse,Adolescent Substance Abuse ,3970,"SUPPLEMENT USE & ABUSE Use of supplements or special diets to enhance athletic perfor- mance dates to antiquity. Today, many elite and casual ath- letes use ergogenic supplements in an attempt to improve performance. The most popular products used by adolescents are protein supplements, creatine, and the prohormones. Strength athletes (ie, weight lifters) use protein powders and shakes to enhance muscle repair and mass. The amount of protein consumed by athletes often greatly exceeds the recom- mended daily allowance for weight lifters and other resistance- training athletes (1.6–1.7 g/kg/d). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) condemns the use of performance-enhanc- ing substances. Excess consumption of protein provides no added strength or muscle mass and can provoke renal failure in teens with underlying renal dysfunction. Sales of creatine supplements are over $400 million (U.S.) per year. Creatine—a combination of glycine, arginine, and methionine that is produced naturally in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas—facilitates production of adenosine triphosphate and increases free energy for muscle contraction. It maximizes power during short-duration, intense exercise and improves baseline strength in adults. Creatine does not improve perfor- mance in longer-duration, aerobic exercise nor has its effective- ness been analyzed in children. Although the American College of Sports Medicine discourages its use by people younger than 18 years of age, recent studies show that creatine is extensively used by athletes in grades 6–12. Side effects include weight gain, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and increased muscle strain. There are conflicting reports about the risk of renal damage. There has been a disturbing increase in the availability and use of prohormones, specifically dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. Sold as dietary supplements, these precursors to testosterone and other sex hormones are sold without federal regulation. Endogenous DHEA is pro- duced in the adrenal cortex as a precursor of gonadal hor- mones. Putative benefits of DHEA are increased fat catabo- lism; increased muscle mass; increased libido; “improved” immune function; and decreased memory loss, heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer and Parkin- son disease. Although its effects on strength and performance in athletes remain unstudied and unproven, the advertised   ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE 143 benefits are attractive to many athletes. Its effect on young, healthy individuals (ie, those with higher baseline DHEA levels) has not been studied. In adults, two studies have shown that doses of 50–100 mg/d cause increased androgenic steroid plasma levels and increased subjective perception of physical and psychological well-being. Users of DHEA report few adverse effects. Androstenedione, which is banned by the International Olympic Committee, National Collegiate Athletic Associa- tion, and National Football League, is converted to testoste- rone in the liver. A recent study of young athletes concluded that oral androstenedione does not increase plasma testoste- rone concentration. In young eugonadal men it has no anabolic effect on muscle protein metabolism. Other studies have shown increased biologically active estrogen levels. No long-term studies have been conducted. Its side effects are believed to be similar to those of other anabolic and andro- genic agents. Most side effects are secondary to androgen excess—hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinism, depression, aggression, paranoia, acne, male pattern baldness, alopecia, and priapism. Most effects are reversible with cessation of use. Irreversible side effects include virilization in females (hair loss, clitoromegaly, hir- sutism, and voice-deepening) and gynecomastia in males. As the use of supplements and herbs increases, it will be increasingly important for pediatric care providers to be familiar with their common side effects. The Internet has become a source for information about and distribution of these products. The easy accessibility, perceived low risk, and low cost of these products significantly increase the likeli- hood that they will become substances of abuse by the pediatric population.

165,Response to the Problem,Adolescent Substance Abuse ,3134,"RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM Federal, state, and local governments attempt to control the damage caused by substance abuse by prohibiting use and by legislating against associated high-risk behaviors (eg, enact- ing drunk-driving laws and nighttime curfews). However, neither these legal actions nor the large sums of money spent on school- and community-based drug abuse prevention and treatment programs have curbed the problem. Hence, the AAP recommends that pediatricians become knowledge- able about the extent and nature of drugs used in their community, provide anticipatory guidance to parents start- ing with the first prenatal visit, and be aware of community referral and treatment resources. The Internet has made the task of limiting drug use more difficult. For example, poor methods for age verification make it easy for minors to purchase tobacco products online. The media also glamorize use of tobacco and alcohol. Pro- tobacco marketing and media stimulate tobacco use among youth while recent state budget crises have cut anti-tobacco advertising.

165,Predicting the Progression from Use to Abuse,Adolescent Substance Abuse ,5763,"PREDICTING THE PROGRESSION  FROM USE TO ABUSE Most adolescents use mood-altering substances intermittently or experimentally at the start. The challenge to pediatric health care providers is to recognize the warning signs, identify poten- tial abusers early, and intervene in an effective and timely fashion before acute or chronic use results in morbidity. The   CHAPTER 4 144 best predictors of ethanol and drug abuse are male sex, young age at first use, and associating with drug-using peers. It is still unclear why only a minority of the young people exhibiting the high-risk characteristics listed in Table 4–3 go on to abuse substances. Substance abuse is a symptom of personal and social maladjustment as often as it is a cause. Because there is a direct relationship between the number of risk factors listed in Table 4–3 and the frequency of substance abuse, a combination of risk factors is the best indicator of risk. Even so, most teenagers with multiple risk characteristics never develop a substance abuse problem, presumably because the protective factors listed in Table 4–3 give them enough resilience to cope with stress in more socially adaptive ways. Being aware of the risk domains in Table 4–3 will help physicians identify young- sters most apt to need counseling about substance abuse. Brown RT: Risk factors for substance abuse in adolescents.

Given the high incidence of substance abuse and the subtlety of its early signs and symptoms, a general psychoso- cial assessment is the best way to screen for substance abuse among adolescents. Interviewing and counseling techniques and methods for taking a psychosocial history are discussed in Table 4–3. Factors that influence the progression from substance use to substance abuse.

Household products such as bleach, vinegar, Visine eye drops (for marijuana), strong alkali drain cleaners, and detergents are also used. (Teenagers should be advised that despite street lore, ingesting these compounds is an ineffec- tive and potentially dangerous way to prevent drug detection in the urine.) Close observation during collection and pre- testing the temperature, specific gravity, and pH of urine samples may detect attempts at deception. Internet-based home drug-testing products are avail- able for parents; however, these products have limitations and potential risks. The AAP recommends that home and school-based drug testing not be implemented until the safety and efficacy of these procedures can be established. It further recommends that parents be encouraged to consult the adolescent’s primary care provider rather than relying on home drug-testing products.

169,Treatment & Referral,Adolescent Substance Abuse ,2371,"TREATMENT & REFERRAL Office-Based Treatment The AMA and the AAP recommend that all children and adolescents receive counseling about the dangers of sub- stance use and abuse from their primary care providers. By offering confidential health care services and routinely coun- seling about the risks associated with drug abuse, primary care providers can help most patients avoid the adverse consequences of experimentation with mood-altering sub- stances. However, more intervention is required for young- sters in environments where substance abuse is regarded as acceptable recreational behavior. Counseling strategies appropriate for patients who wish to change their behavior may be ineffective for patients who do not consider use of mood-altering substances to be a problem. It may therefore be preferable to begin discussions about treatment by help- ing youngsters consider alternative ways of meeting the needs that substance use is currently providing.

J Subst Abuse Treat 2006;31:59 [PMID: 16814011]. PREVENTION Prevention of substance abuse has been a public health priority since the 1980s. Pediatric health care providers are important as advocates and educators of the community and government on developmentally appropriate pro- grams. Primary level programs focus on preventing the initiation of substance use. The Drug Awareness and Resis- tance Education (D.A.R.E.) program is a familiar example of a primary prevention program that attempts to educate elementary and middle school students about the adverse consequences of substance abuse and enable them to resist peer pressures. Secondary level programs target populations at increased risk for substance use. The aim is to prevent progression from initiation to continuance and maintenance, relying on individualized intervention to reduce the risk and enhance the protective factors listed in Table 4–3. This approach enables the provider to focus scarce resources on those who are most likely to benefit from them. Alateen, which sup- ports the children of alcoholic parents, typifies secondary level prevention. Tertiary level prevention programs target young people who have been identified as substance abusers. The aim is to prevent the morbid consequences of substance use. One example is identifying adolescents who misuse alcohol and drugs at parties and providing them with a safe ride home. Because prevention is more effective when targeted at reduc- ing the initiation of substance use than at decreasing use, tertiary prevention is the least effective approach. Very few population-based programs undergo rigorous scientific evaluation. It is the consensus among drug educa- tors that primary prevention programs, such as D.A.R.E., have minimal effect in decreasing the use of illicit substances. During the 1990s, when these programs were most popular, a smaller proportion of middle- and high-school students perceived illicit drug and alcohol use as dangerous, and substance use actually increased. Even when knowledge- and resistance-based programs do increase student understand- ing of adverse consequences, there is no evidence that they change attitudes or abuse rates. The failure of resistance education programs has fostered interest in a potentially more effective type of program, exemplified by the Adolescents Training and Learning to Avoid Steroids program. This program, a same-sex, peer- educator program designed to simultaneously reduce the use of steroids and improve dietary and exercise habits of teen athletes has proven effective in randomized controlled trials. Pediatric health care providers should promote developmen- tally appropriate prevention programs like this one that address the social and psychological problems predisposing youngsters to substance abuse and provide realistic alterna- tive solutions. Parents and others should understand that most adoles- cents who abuse alcohol and drugs do not do so just for the high. Rather, these behaviors are often purposeful, develop- mentally appropriate coping strategies. To the extent that these behaviors meet young peoples’ developmental needs, they are not apt to be abandoned unless equally attractive alternatives are available. For example, even though many teenagers cite stress and anxiety as reasons for smoking, teen-oriented smoking cessation programs rarely address the young smoker’s need for alternative coping strategies by offering stress management training. Similarly, for the youngster growing up in an impoverished urban environ- ment, the real costs of substance abuse may be too low and the rewards too high to be influenced by talk and knowledge alone. It is unreasonable to expect a talk-based intervention to change attitudes and behaviors in a direction that is opposite to that of the child’s own social milieu. The efficacy of the most promising prevention models and interventions is apt to decay over time unless changes in the social environment provide substance-abusing children and ado- lescents with realistic alternative ways to meet their develop- mental needs.

Sigel, MD Teenagers and younger children continue to develop eating disorders at a significant rate. The spectrum of eating disor- ders includes anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), and binge-eating disorder. The relationship between genetics and environment in the development of eating disorders is com- plex. These disorders are best defined in a biopsychosocial context. "
174,Etiology,Adolescent Substance Abuse ,466,"ETIOLOGY A genetic susceptibility to develop eating disorders probably exists. The incidence of AN is 7% in first-degree relatives of anorexic patients compared with 1–2% in the general popu- lation. The concordance rate in monozygotic twins is 55%, compared with 7% in dizygotic twins. Twin studies estimate the heritability of AN as 33–84%, and BN as 28–83%. First- degree female relatives of males with AN have a 20-fold relative risk of AN. Most studies have found a higher inci- dence of eating disorders among first-degree relatives of bulimic patients as well. Genomic regions on chromosome 1 (for AN) and chromosome 10 (for BN) appear to harbor susceptibility genes. Abnormalities of leptin, a hormone secreted by adipo- cytes that regulates energy homeostasis and satiety signaling, do not appear to cause AN primarily, but may mediate energy changes that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and play a role in perpetuating AN. Leptin physiology is deranged in patients with AN. Leptin levels increase to excessive levels as individuals regain weight. The idiosyn- cratic higher levels of leptin may contribute to the difficulty AN patients have when trying to regain weight, as higher leptin levels signal the body to decrease energy intake. Leptin also plays a significant role in some of the sequelae of AN, with low levels signaling the hypothalamus to inhibit repro- ductive hormone production. There is evidence of persistently altered serotonergic and dopaminergic function in AN. Other alterations in neu- ropeptides and gut peptides are found both in AN and BN. Adiponectin appears elevated in AN, although it is unclear whether this is due to the malnourished state, or elevated independently of malnutrition. Cholecystokinin is decreased in BN, perhaps contributing to the lack of postingestion satiety that perpetuates a binge. An alteration in dopamine has also been recognized, although its significance is not clear. Ghrelin, a gut peptide, is elevated in patients with AN and does not decrease in the normal fashion after a meal in these patients. Despite significant research into the neurobiology of eating disorders, it remains unclear whether alterations contribute to the development of eating disorders or are present as a consequence of the physiologic changes associ- ated with the disorders. Patients with BN or binge-eating disorder appear to have a blunted serotonin response to eating and satiety. With a decreased satiety response, patients continue to eat, leading to a binge. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) tends to equilibrate satiety regulation. More research is needed to determine which factors are causative and which are results of the eating disorder. Traditional psychological theory has suggested many environmental factors that might promote the development of eating disorders. Enmeshment of mother with daughter to the point that the teenager cannot develop her own identity (a key developmental marker of adolescence) may be a predisposing factor. The teenager may cope by asserting control over food, as she senses her lack of control in the developmental realm. A second theory involves father- daughter distancing. As puberty progresses and a girl’s sexu- ality blossoms, a father may experience difficulty in dealing with his daughter as a sexual being and may respond by withdrawing both emotionally and physically. The teenage girl may intuitively recognize this and subconsciously decrease her food intake in order to become prepubertal again. A third theory is related to puberty itself. Some teenagers may fear or dislike their changing bodies. By Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

175,Incidence,Adolescent Substance Abuse ,1728,"INCIDENCE AN is the third most common chronic illness of teenaged girls in the United States. The incidence has been increasing steadily in the United States since the 1930s. Although ascer- taining exact incidence is difficult, most studies show that 1– 2% of teenagers develop AN and 2–4% develop BN. Adoles- cents outnumber adults 5 to 1, although the number of adults with eating disorders is rising. Incidence is also increasing among younger children. Prepubertal patients often have significant associated psychiatric diagnoses. Males comprise about 10% of the patients with eating disorders, and this prevalence appears to be increasing. Prevalence of full or partial syndrome BN is 1.1% in males and 3.2% in females (1:2.9 male-to-female ratio). Prevalence of full or partial syndrome AN is 0.9% in males and 1.8% in females (1:2 ratio). The increasing number of males with eating disorders corre- lates with the increased media emphasis on muscular, chiseled appearance as the male ideal. Recent literature on preadolescents with eating disorders suggests that patients younger than 13 years are more likely to be male and more likely to have EDNOS. Younger patients are less likely to engage in behaviors characteristic of BN. They present with more rapid weight loss and lower percentile body weight than adolescents. Many youth engage in some eating disorder behaviors. In the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey of U.S. teenag- ers published by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion (Eaton et al, 2005), 62% of females and 30% of males had attempted to lose weight during the 30 days preceding the survey. Twelve percent had fasted for more than 24 hours to lose weight, and 6.1% had used diet pills, powders, or liquids to lose weight (8.1% of girls and 4.6% of boys). Self- induced vomiting or laxative use was common; 6.2% of females and 2.8% of males used one or the other. Forty-six percent of females and 30% of males reported at least one bingeing episode during their lifetime. Although the number of youth with full-blown eating disorders is low, it is alarm- ing that so many youth experiment with unhealthy weight control habits. These signs may be precursors to the develop- ment of eating disorders, and clinicians should explore these practices with all of their adolescent patients.

Demographics have changed, and eating disor- ders now occur across all racial and ethnic groups. There is no difference among blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and whites in the frequency of eating disorder symptoms or eating disorder risk factors. Children involved in gymnastics, figure skating, and ballet—activities that emphasize (and in which coaches often require) thin bodies—are at higher risk for anorexia than are children in sports that do not emphasize body image. Adoles- cents who believe that being thin represents the ideal frame for a female, those who are dissatisfied with their bodies, and those with a history of dieting are at increased risk for eating disorders. Sudden changes in dietary habits, such as becoming vegetarian, may be a first sign of anorexia, especially if the change is abrupt and without good reason. The typical bulimic patient is more impulsive, tending to engage in risk-taking behavior such as alcohol use, drug use, and sexual experimentation. Bulimic patients are often an appropriate weight for height or slightly overweight. They have average academic performance. Some studies report that 50% of bulimic patients have been sexually abused. Youth with diabetes have an increased risk of BN. In males, wrestling predisposes to BN, and homosexual orientation is associated with binge eating.   EATING DISORDERS 153 restricting food intake they lose weight, stop menstruating, and effectively reverse pubertal development.

ANOREXIA NERVOSA Table 5–1 lists the diagnostic criteria for AN, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). There are two forms of AN. In the restricting type, patients do not regularly engage in binge eating or purging. In the purging type, classic AN is combined with binge eating or purging behavior, or both. Distinguishing between the two is important as they carry different implications for prognosis and treatment. There is ongoing debate about the criteria for AN. Some experts suggest eliminating amenorrhea as a specific crite- rion. Though patients may not demonstrate all features of AN, they may still exhibit the deleterious symptoms associ- ated with AN.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Clinicians should recognize the early symptoms and signs of AN because early intervention may prevent the full-blown syndrome from developing. Patients may show some of the behaviors and psychology of AN, such as reduction in dietary fat and intense concern with body image, even before weight loss or amenorrhea occurs. Making the diagnosis of AN can be challenging because adolescents may try to conceal their illness. Assessing the patient’s body image is essential to determining the diagno- sis. Table 5–2 lists screening questions that help tease out a teenager’s perceptions of body image. Other diagnostic screening tools (eg, Eating Attitudes Test) assess a range of eating and dieting behaviors. Parental observations are criti- cal in determining whether a patient has expressed dissatis- faction over body habitus and determining which weight loss techniques the child has used. If the teenager is unwilling to share his or her concerns about body image, the clinician may find clues to the diagnosis by carefully considering other presenting symptoms. Weight loss from a baseline of normal body weight is an obvious red flag and should raise the clinical suspicion for the presence of an eating disorder. Additionally, AN should be considered in any girl with secondary amenorrhea who has lost weight. Physical symptoms are usually secondary to weight loss and proportional to the degree of malnutrition. The body effectively goes into hibernation, becoming functionally hypothyroid (euthyroid sick) to save energy. Body tempera- ture decreases, and patients report being colder than normal. Patients become bradycardic, especially in the supine posi- tion. Dizziness, lightheadedness, and syncope may occur as a result of orthostasis and hypotension secondary to impaired cardiac function. Left ventricular mass is decreased (as is the mass of all striated muscle), stroke volume is compromised, and peripheral resistance is increased, contributing to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients can develop pro- longed QTc syndrome  and increased QT dispersion, putting them at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Peripheral circulation is reduced. Hands and feet may be blue and cool. Hair thins, nails become brittle, and skin becomes dry. Lanugo develops as a primitive response to starvation. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract may be affected. Inability to take in normal quantities of food, early satiety, and gastroesophageal reflux can develop as the body adapts to reduced intake. The normal gastrocolic reflex may be lost due to lack of stimula- tion by food, causing bloating and constipation. One study Table 5–1. Diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. A. Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal  weight for age and height (eg, weight loss leading to maintenance  of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make  expected weight gain during a period of growth, leading to body  weight less than 85% of that expected). B. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though  underweight. C.

Long-term physical rehabilitation improves gastric emptying and dyspeptic symptoms in AN restricting type, but not inpurgers. Neurologically, patients may experience decreased cogni- tion, inability to concentrate, increased irritability, and depression, which may be related to structural brain changes and decreased cerebral blood flow. A combination of malnutrition and stress causes hypotha- lamic hypogonadism. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis shuts down as the body struggles to survive, directing finite energy resources to vital functions. This may be mediated by the effect of low serum leptin on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Both males and females experience decreased libido and inter- ruption of pubertal development, depending on the timing of the illness. Skeletal growth may be interrupted. Nutritional assessment is vital. Often patients eliminate fat from their diets and may eat as few as 100–200 kcal/d. A gown-only weight after urination is the most accurate way to assess weight. Patients tend to wear bulky clothes and may hide weights in their pockets or drink excessive fluid (water- loading) to trick the practitioner. Calculating body mass index (BMI)—weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared—is an efficient way to interpret degree of malnutrition. BMI below the 25th percentile indicates risk for malnutrition, and one below the fifth percentile signifi- cant malnutrition. Ideal body weight (IBW) for height should be calculated, using the 50th percentile of BMI for age. A weight less than 85% IBW is one of the diagnostic criteria for AN. A hallmark physical sign of girls with AN is amenorrhea, which occurs for two reasons. The hypothalamic-pituitary- ovarian axis shuts down under stress, causing hypothalamic amenorrhea. Additionally, adipose tissue is needed to convert estrogen to its activated form. When weight loss is significant, adipose tissue is lost and there is not enough substrate to activate estrogen. Resumption of normal menses occurs only when both body weight and body fat increase. Approximately 73% of postmenarchal girls will resume menstruating if they reach 90% of IBW. An adolescent female needs about 17% body fat to restart menses and 22% body fat if she has primary amenorrhea. One study demonstrated that target weight gain for return of menses is approximately 1 kg higher than the weight at which menses ceased. B. Laboratory Findings Most organ systems can suffer some degree of damage in the anorexic patient, related both to severity and duration of illness (Table 5–3). Initial screening should include complete blood count with differential; serum levels of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, mag- nesium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone; liver function tests; and urinalysis. An electrocardiogram should be per- formed, because significant electrocardiographic abnormali- ties may be present, most importantly prolonged QTc syn- drome. Bone densitometry should be done if amenorrhea has persisted for 6 months, as patients begin to accumulate risk for osteoporosis.  Differential Diagnosis If the diagnosis is unclear (ie, the patient has lost a significant amount of weight but does not have typical body image distortion or fat phobia), then the clinician must consider the differential diagnosis for weight loss in adolescents. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, hyperthy- roidism, malignancy, and depression. Less common diag- noses include adrenal insufficiency and malabsorption syn- dromes such as celiac disease. The history and physical examination should direct specific laboratory and radiologic evaluation.  Complications (Table 5–4) A. Short-Term Complications 1. Early satiety—Patients may have significant difficulty tolerating even modest quantities of food as their bodies adapt to increased caloric intake. Gastric emptying is poor. Pancreatic and biliary secretion is diminished. Patients may benefit from a gastric-emptying agent such as metoclopra- mide. This complication usually resolves after a patient has become used to larger meals. 2. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome—As patients become malnourished, the fat pad between the superior mesenteric artery and the duodenum may shrink, compress- ing the transverse duodenum and causing vomiting and intolerance of oral intake, especially solids. Diagnosis is made by an upper GI series showing to and fro movement of barium in the descending and transverse duodenum proxi- mal to the obstruction. Treatment involves a liquid diet or Table 5–3. Laboratory findings: anorexia nervosa. Increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine secondary to renal  insufficiency Decreased white blood cells, platelets, and less commonly red blood  cells and hematocrit secondary to bone marrow suppression or fat  atrophy of the bone marrow Increased AST and ALT secondary to malnutrition Increased cholesterol, thought to be related to fatty acid metabolism Decreased alkaline phosphatase secondary to zinc deficiency Low to low-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine Decreased follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estra- diol, and testosterone secondary to shutdown of hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis Abnormal electrolytes related to hydration status Decreased phosphorus Decreased insulin-like growth factor Increased cortisol Decreased urine specific gravity in cases of intentional water intoxication ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase.  CHAPTER 5 156 nasoduodenal feedings until restoration of the fat pad has occurred, coincident with weight gain. 3. Constipation—Patients may have prolonged constipa- tion, often not having a bowel movement for several weeks. Two mechanisms contribute: loss of the gastrocolic reflex and loss of colonic muscle tone. Typically stool softeners are not effective because the colon has decreased peristaltic amplitude. Agents that induce peristalsis, such as bisacodyl, as well as osmotic agents, such as polyethylene glycol- electrolyte solution (MiraLax), are helpful. Constipation can persist for up to 6–8 weeks after refeeding. Occasionally enemas are required. 4. Refeeding syndrome—This is described in the Treat- ment section. B. Long-Term Complications 1. Osteoporosis—Approximately 50% of females with AN have reduced bone mass at one or more sites. The causes of osteopenia and osteoporosis are multiple. Estrogen and testos- terone are essential to potentiate bone development. Higher ghrelin level is an independent predicator of bone density in healthy adolescents; however, it does not appear to contribute to bone loss in patients with AN. Teenagers are particularly at risk as they accrue 40% of their bone mineral during adoles- cence. Low body weight is most predictive of bone loss. Amenorrhea, an indicator of estrogen deficiency and hypotha- lamic amenorrhea, is highly correlated with osteoporosis. Bone minerals begin to resorb without estrogen. Elevated cortisol levels and decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 also contribute to bone resorption. Studies show that as few as 6 months of amenorrhea can lead to osteopenia or osteoporosis. In one study, 44% of adolescents with anorexia had osteopenia of the lumbar spine. Males also can develop osteoporosis due to decreased testosterone and elevated cortisol. A recent finding has shown that depression in adolescent females with AN is associated with a higher risk of osteopo- rosis, compared with AN alone. The reason for this associa- tion is unknown. The only proven treatment for osteoporosis in girls with AN is regaining sufficient weight and body fat to restart the menstrual cycle. Most studies do not support use of hormone replacement therapy to improve bone recovery; however, some Table 5–4. Complications of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.

Some practitioners use hormone replacement therapy if amenorrhea has been present for more than 1 year and the patient is not able to achieve normal body weight. Bisphosphonates used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis are currently being studied in adolescents. Two small randomized controlled trials have shown small positive effects on bone density with alendronate and risedronate, although clinical effectiveness has not yet been determined. Newer treatments with possible effectiveness, including recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 injection and dehydroepiandrosterone, are still under investigation. 2. Brain changes—As malnutrition becomes more pro- nounced, brain tissue—both white and gray matter—is lost, with a compensatory increase in cerebrospinal fluid in the sulci and ventricles. Follow-up studies of weight-recovered anorexic patients show a persistent loss of gray matter, although white matter returns to normal. Functionally there does not seem to be a direct relationship between cognition and brain tissue loss, although studies have shown a decrease in cognitive ability and decreased cerebral blood flow in very malnourished patients. Making patients and family aware that brain tissue can be lost may improve their perception of the seriousness of this disorder.

Mortality Patients with eating disorders are at a higher risk of death than the general population. Meta-analysis shows that the risk of dying is 5.9% in such patients. Mortality estimates vary between 0% and 18%, depending on the patient population and the duration of follow-up. One study showed the risk of dying to be 0.56% per year. Death in anorexic patients is due to suicide, abnormal electrolytes, and cardiac arrhythmias. Herzog DB et al: Mortality in eating disorders: A descriptive study. Int J Eat Disord 2000;28:20 [PMID: 10800010].  Treatment A. General Approach Factors that determine treatment interventions are severity of illness, duration of illness, specific manifestations of disease, previous treatment approaches and outcomes, pro- gram availability, financial resources, and insurance cover- age. Treatment options include outpatient management, day treatment hospitalization, and inpatient medical or psychiat- ric hospitalization. Residential treatment is most often used when outpatient management or short-term hospitalization fails and the eating disorder becomes chronic. Residential treatment usually lasts 2–6 months. Day treatment programs are a good intervention for patients who do not yet need inpatient care but who are not improving with outpatient management. Treatment is costly. Many patients do not have insurance benefits that adequately cover the cost of treat- ment, leaving parents and practitioners with profound dilemmas as to how to best provide treatment in the face of financial constraints. Regardless of the treatment program, a multidisciplinary approach is most effective and should include medical mon- itoring, nutrition therapy, and individual and family psycho- therapy by experienced practitioners. Family therapy is especially helpful with younger teenagers, whereas older teenagers tend to benefit more from individual therapy. Family therapy is an important means of helping families understand the development of the disease and addressing issues that may be barriers to recovery. Both types of therapy are encouraged in most treatment programs, and recovery without psychotherapy is unusual. The average length of therapy is roughly 6–9 months, although some individuals continue therapy for extended periods. Adjunctive modali- ties include art and horticulture therapy, therapeutic recre- ation, and massage therapy. A newer family therapy approach, manualized family therapy, developed in Britain by Maudsley and adapted by Lock and LeGrange, has shifted the therapeutic approach to adolescents with AN. Traditional therapy allowed the adoles- cent to control his or her eating, and the parents to remain uninvolved with the food-portion of recovery. The manual- ized approach gives power and control back to parents. Treatment is prescribed for 20 weekly sessions. The first 10 weeks are devoted to empowering parents, putting them in control of their child’s nutrition and exercise. Parents are educated about the dangers of malnutrition and are instructed to supervise each meal. The next phase—sessions 11–16—returns control over eating to the adolescent once he or she accepts the demands of the parents. The last phase of treatment, sessions 17–20, occurs when the patient is main- taining a healthy weight, and shifts the focus away from the eating disorder, examining instead the impact that the eating disorder has had on establishing a healthy adolescent iden- tity. This approach is reported to result in good or interme- diate outcomes in 90% of treated adolescents.  CHAPTER 5 158 Careful instruction in nutrition helps the teenager and family dispel misconceptions about nutrition, identify realis- tic nutritional goals, and normalize eating. Initially, nutrition education may be the most important intervention as the teenager slowly works through his or her fears of fat-contain- ing foods and weight gain. The teenager begins to trust the nutrition therapist and restore body weight, eventually eating in a well-balanced, healthy manner. The key to determining level of intervention is the degree of malnutrition, the rapidity of weight loss, the degree of medical compromise, and the presence of life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities. No absolute criteria determine level of intervention. The practitioner must examine the degree of medical compromise and consider immediate risks and the potential for an individual to reverse the situation on his or her own. B. Inpatient Treatment Table 5–5 lists the criteria for hospital admission generally used in the medical community. It is usually quite difficult for a patient who is losing weight rapidly (> 2 lb/wk) to reverse the weight loss because the body is in a catabolic state. Goals of hospitalization include arresting weight loss and stabilizing hemodynamics. Nutrition is the most vital inpa- tient medicine. Clinicians can safely begin with a meal plan containing approximately 250 kcal more than the patient has been routinely eating, which can usually be accomplished orally. Ideally, with the help of a nutritionist, patients should start with a well-balanced meal plan, with appropriate pro- portions of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Usually patients tolerate oral meals. If the patient resists, nasogastric or intra- venous alimentation can be used for a short time. Aside from caloric needs, the clinician needs to consider the patient’s hydration and include the appropriate amount of fluid with the meal plan. Dehydration should be corrected slowly. The oral route is usually adequate. Aggressive intravenous fluid administration should be avoided because left ventricular mass is compromised and a rapid increase in volume may not be tolerated. Regulating fluid intake is important, because water intoxication can contribute to abnormal electrolytes and falsified weights. During the initial introduction of food, the clinician should monitor the patient for refeeding syndrome, a phe- nomenon that occurs if caloric intake is increased too rap- idly. Signs of refeeding syndrome are decreased serum phos- phorus (as the body resumes synthesis of adenosine triphosphate), decreased serum potassium (as increased insulin causes K+ to shift from extracellular fluid into K+- depleted cells), and rarely, edema related to fluid shifts or congestive heart failure. Although specific guidelines do not exist, many practitio- ners begin phosphorus supplementation if patients are severely malnourished (< 70% IBW) or their intake has been consistently less than 500 kcal/d. Caloric intake can be increased 250 kcal/d as long as refeeding syndrome does not occur. Weight goals vary depending on programmatic approach. Typically intake is adjusted to reach a goal of 0.1–0.25 kg/d weight gain. Overnight monitoring for bradycardia is helpful in assessing degree of metabolic compromise. Usually the more rapid and severe the weight loss is, the worse the bradycardia. Improving bradycardia correlates with weight recovery. Orthostatic hypotension is most severe around hospital day 4, improving steadily and correcting by the third week of nutritional rehabilitation. An electrocardiogram should be obtained because the patient is at risk for prolonged QTc syndrome and junctional arrhythmias related to the severity of bradycardia. It usually takes 2–3 weeks to reach the initial goals of hospitalization—steady weight gain, toleration of oral diet without signs of refeeding syndrome, corrected bradycardia (heart rate > 45 beats/min for three consecutive nights), and correction of orthostasis. Specific weight criteria are used by many programs when considering discharge. This depends partly on admission weight. Ideally a patient gains at least 5% of his or her ideal weight. Some programs set discharge at 80%, 85%, or 90% IBW. Patient outcomes are improved with discharge at a higher body weight. One study has shown that patients do better if discharged at 95% IBW. Frequently, insurance companies do not pay for hospital stays beyond strict medical stabilization (normal vital signs and normal electrolytes). In many practitioners’ experience, relapse rate is high if patients are discharged at less than 75% IBW. Extremely malnourished patients may not benefit from individual psychotherapy or nutritional instruction initially because of their cognitive impairment. Beginning family psychotherapy at first, with the addition of individual psy- chotherapy after the first week of refeeding, may be more effective. C. Pharmacotherapy Use of psychotropic medications is common in treatment of AN, despite lack of solid proof of efficacy. The most promis- ing class of medication is the atypical antipsychotics. Several open label trials support the use of atypical antipsychotics (risperidone olanzapine, quetiapine), which target specifically the body image distortion of these patients. One review found that olanzapine (2.5–15 mg/d) was associated with improved Table 5–5. Criteria for inpatient  treatment of anorexia nervosa.

181,Bulimia Nervosa,Eating Disorders ,3248,"BULIMIA NERVOSA Table 5–6 lists the diagnostic criteria for BN. Binge eating is either eating excessive amounts of food during a normal mealtime or having a meal that lasts longer than usual. Bulimic individuals feel out of control while eating, unable or unwilling to recognize satiety signals. Any type of food may be eaten in a binge, although typically it is either carbohydrates or junk food. Extreme guilt is often associated with the episode. At some point, either prior to or during a binge, bulimic individuals often decide to purge as a means of preventing weight gain. The most common ways to purge are self-induced vomiting, exercise, and laxative use. Some indi- viduals will vomit multiple times during a purge episode, after using large amounts of water to cleanse their system. This can induce significant electrolyte abnormalities such as hypona- tremia and hypokalemia, which may put the patient at acute risk for arrhythmia or seizure. Other methods of purging include diuretics, diet pills, cathartics, and nutritional supple- ments, including Metabolife. Diagnosing BN can be difficult unless the teenager is forth- coming or parents or caregivers can supply direct observations. Bulimic patients are usually average or slightly above average in body weight and have no physical abnormalities. Screening all teenagers for body image concerns is crucial. If the teenager Table 5–6. Diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is  characterized by both of the following: (1) eating, in a discrete period of time (eg, within any 2-hour  period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most  people would eat during a similar period of time and under  similar circumstances. (2) a sense of lack of control over eating during the episodes (eg,  a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how  much one is eating). B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent  weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives,  diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive  exercise. C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both  occur, on average, at least twice a week for 3 months. D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. E.

PROGNOSIS Outcome in eating disorders, especially AN, has been studied extensively. Unfortunately, most studies have focused on specific inpatient treatment programs, and few have evalu- ated the less ill patients who do not need hospitalization. About 40–50% of patients receiving treatment recover; 20– 30% have intermittent relapses; and 20% have chronic, unremitting illness. As time from initial onset lengthens, the recovery rate decreases and mortality associated with AN and BN increases. The course of AN often includes significant weight fluctuations over time, and it may be a matter of years until recovery is certain. The course of BN often includes relapses of bingeing and purging, although bulimic patients initially recover faster than do anorexic patients. Up to 50% of anorexic patients may develop bulimia, as well as major psychological complications, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. Bulimic patients also develop similar psychological illness but rarely develop anorexia. Long-term medical sequelae, aside from low body weight and amenorrhea, have not been studied in an outcome format, although AN is known to have multiple medical consequences, including osteoporosis and structural brain changes. It is unclear whether age at onset affects outcome, but shorter length of time between symptom onset and ther- apy tends to improve outcome. Various treatment modal- ities can be equally effective. Favorable outcomes have been found with brief medical hospitalization and long psychiatric or residential hospitalization. Higher dis- charge weight seems to improve the initial outcome. It is difficult to compare treatment regimens, because the numbers are small and the type of patient and illness varies between studies. No existing studies compare out- patient to inpatient treatment or the effects of day treat- ment on recovery. Binge-eating disorder has been recognized only recently, and outcomes have not been studied. Intervention with an SSRI appears to help the bingeing, but little is known regarding long-term prognosis.

The prevalence is higher for those juveniles living in poor socioeconomic circumstances. Unfortunately, the shortage of "
185,Mental Health in the Primary Care Setting,Eating Disorders ,336,"mental health providers, stigma attached to receiving mental health services, chronic underfunding, institutional barriers of the public mental health system, and disparate insurance benefits have contributed to the fact that only 2% of these children are actually seen by mental health specialists. About 75% of children with psychiatric distur- bances are seen in primary care settings, and half of all pediatric office visits involve behavioral, psychosocial, or educational concerns. Parents and children often prefer discussing these issues with someone they already know and trust. As a result, primary care physicians are compelled to play an important role in the identification, initiation, man- agement, and coordination of mental health care in children and adolescents. Despite being strategically positioned as the gatekeeper for identifying these concerns, primary care physicians iden- tify fewer than 20% of children with emotional and behav- ioral problems during health supervision visits when these concerns are also present. In addition, these problems are not identified when they begin (and are more readily amena- ble to treatment). This gatekeeper role has become more important over the past decade as advances in mental health awareness and treatment have improved opportunities for early identification and intervention. This role is especially critical since child psychiatry remains an underserved medi- cal specialty, with only 7000 board-certified child and ado- lescent psychiatrists in the United States. In contrast, the more than 50,000 board-certified pediatricians in the United States are in a unique position to identify issues affecting the emotional health of children and to initiate treatment or referrals to other providers. Emotional problems that develop during childhood and adolescence can have a significant impact on development and may continue into adulthood; in fact, most “adult” psychiatric disorders have their onset during childhood. Most disorders do not present as an “all-or-none” phenom- enon; rather, they progress from adjustment concerns to perturbations in functioning to significant disturbances and severe disorders. Pediatricians have the capacity to manage emotional problems and behavioral conditions early on, when improvement can be achieved with less intensive interventions. If pediatricians and schools do not appropri- ately identify mental health problems, provide education about the benefits of intervention, and encourage and ini- tiate intervention, childhood-onset disorders are more likely to persist, cause worsening impairment, and lead to a down- ward spiral of school and social difficulties, poor employ- ment opportunities, and poverty in adulthood. Pediatricians and other primary care providers may be the first or sometimes only medical professional in a position to identify a mental health problem. This chapter reviews prevention, surveillance, and screening for mental illness; situations that may arise in the context of such assessments; illnesses that are often diagnosed during childhood or ado- lescence; current recommendations for interventions and use of psychotropic medications; and indications for referral to mental health professionals.

MODELS OF CARE ENCOMPASSING MENTAL  HEALTH IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING Given the many barriers to receiving mental health care, new approaches to providing mental health professional services have been recently explored. Usual or typical pediatric care of emotional and behav- ioral problems is related to the comfort level of the individ- ual pediatric provider and available resources.

However, as stated earlier, the majority of emotional and behavioral "
186,Problems,Eating Disorders ,230,"problems are not identified in this model of care. In addition, when they are identified, the logistics of referral can be problematic. Although pediatricians often refer to mental health provid- ers, only 50% of families will actually attend an appointment and the average number of appointments attended is only slightly greater than one. Based on level of comfort and training, the primary clinician in this model is more likely to be responsible for psychiatric medications if prescribed. Among the technological interventions that can enhance identification of problems and target specific symptoms for assessment is the Child Health and Interactive Developmen- tal System (CHADIS) (http://www.childhealthcare.org). In this system, parents use a computer kiosk to note their level of concern about various behaviors, which triggers algorith- mic interviews for each concern based on psychiatric diag- nostic criteria. The CHADIS system provides an electronic worksheet of analyzed results, school communication tools, as well as other resources. Enhanced care is a model of care in which a pediatric developmental or behavioral specialist is embedded in the clinic, thus making for improved referral and communica- tion and management. This “co-location” creates easier access for patients and improved communication with men- tal health professionals. Collaborative care provides high-quality, multidisci- plinary and collaborative care through the co-location of educators, consultants, or direct service providers in the clinic. Successful collaborative care results in greater special- ist involvement by negating identification and referral and other system-of-care barriers. Successful components include a leadership team, primary clinicians, mental health and developmental specialists, administrators, clinical informat- ics specialists, and care managers. Collaborative care implies that nearly all visits are done jointly and that mental health professionals are always available for consultation, in con- trast to the approach in the enhanced care model, which requires the scheduling of an appointment with a mental health specialist in the practice. These interventions can be accomplished through collaboration among mental health and primary care providers, mental health systems and primary care practices, and in academic settings with inter- departmental collaboration. Typically, philanthropic or other foundation grants are necessary to start a collaborative program so that reimbursement and sustainability concerns can be identified and remedied.

EARLY IDENTIFICATION &  PREVENTION OF DEVELOPMENTAL & SOCIOEMOTIONAL PROBLEMS The role of the primary care pediatrician continues to expand to include public health, mental health, and community con- cerns. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Policy Statement on Community Pediatrics addresses the fact that today’s children and families live in a period of rapid social change. In addition, the economic organization of the health care and social service systems in the United States is undergo- ing profound changes. For many pediatricians, efforts to pro- mote the health of children have been directed at attending to the needs of particular children in a practice setting, on an individual basis, and providing them with a medical home. This approach, in combination with pediatricians’ own per- sonal community interests and commitments, has been dra- matically successful. Increasingly, however, the major threats to the health of U.S. children—the new morbidity—arise from problems that cannot be adequately addressed by the practice model alone. These problems include unacceptably high infant mortality rates in certain communities, extraordinary levels of intentional and unintentional injuries, chemical dependency, behavioral and developmental consequences of inappropriate care and experience, family dysfunction, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births, and lack of a medical home. The Policy Statement concludes that “We must become partners with others, or we will become increasingly irrelevant to the health of children.” Today’s community pediatrician seeks to provide a far more realistic and complete clinical picture by taking responsibility for all children in a community, providing preventive and curative services, and understanding the determinants and consequences of child health and illness, as well as the effectiveness of services provided. Bright Futures The Bright Futures Task Force, a partnership initiated by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) over a decade ago, is a philosophy and approach that is dedicated to the principle that every child deserves to be healthy, and that optimal health involves a trusting relationship between the health profes- sional, the child, the family, and the community. As part of this initiative, Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents was developed to provide comprehensive health supervision guidelines, including rec- ommendations on immunizations, routine health screenings, and anticipatory guidance. In addition, Bright Futures for Mental Health provides numerous guidelines, tools, and strat- egies for improving mental health identification, assessment, initiation, management, and coordination.   CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 165 Surgeon General’s National Action Plan The U.S. Surgeon General also recommends that pediatrics continue to evolve and include lifestyle, health system, and other psychosocial areas. The U.S. Surgeon General’s National Action Agenda on Mental Health includes several calls to primary care pediatricians, including the following: engage other professional organizations in educating new frontline providers in various systems (eg, teachers, physi- cians, nurses, hospital emergency personnel, day care pro- viders, probation officers, and other child health care pro- viders) in child development; equip them with skills to address and enhance children’s mental health; and train them to recognize early symptoms of emotional or behav- ioral problems for proactive intervention. Such training must focus on developmental and cultural differences in cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral functioning, and understanding these issues in familial and ecological context.

187,Identification & Assessment during Health  Maintenance Visits,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,1702,"IDENTIFICATION & ASSESSMENT  DURING HEALTH MAINTENANCE VISITS Most families seek help from their primary care providers when they are concerned about a child’s health, growth, or development. Historically, the most efficient indicator in eliciting psychosocial problems is the history provided by parents or guardians, and interview and observation of the child. The possible approaches to identification of problems include surveillance, screening, and assessment Surveillance consists of the following elements: checking in, eliciting concerns, asking open-ended questions, watching and waiting, listening for red flags, identifying risk factors, and monitoring closely over time. Like vital signs, which represent an essential component of the physical evaluation, the essential components of the primary care surveillance for mental health concerns should generally include a review of the youth’s general functioning in different aspects of their life. Five questions forming the mnemonic PSYCH can be addressed to parents and youth as a surveillance means of uncovering areas of concern. 1. Parent-child interaction: How are things going with you and your parents? Or you and your infant (or toddler)? 2. School: How are things going in school (or day care)? (academically and behaviorally) 3. Youth: How are things going with peer relationships? 4. Casa: How are things going at home? (including siblings, family stresses, and relationship with parents) 5. Happiness: How would you describe your mood? Many pediatric practices are strapped by lack of continu- ity and not enough time to do in-depth surveillance. In addition, surveillance is notoriously tied to office and pro- vider characteristics. Given current time constraints for current pediatric visits, and the fact that only 18% of parents reporting elevated behavior problems in children actually told their providers about it, surveillance is currently consid- ered nonoptimal. Although part of the clinical interview with families, surveillance is not, under current Medicaid and insurance reimbursement plans, a separate and billable ser- vice, whereas formal screening is. Screening is the process of using standardized instru- ments to determine the existence of a problem. Newborn, hearing, vision, and developmental screenings are common in today’s pediatric practice. However, the morbidity associ- ated with developmental, emotional, and psychosocial prob- lems requires that socioemotional screening to identify the presence of symptoms of emotional, behavioral, or relation- ship disorders be performed, as well. Screening tools are brief, easy to use, and can be administered as a questionnaire Table 6–1. The pediatric primary care  provider’s role in mental health.

Pediatricians who feel comfortable implementing the rec- ommendations of a mental health professional with whom they have a collaborative relationship should consider remain- ing involved in the management and coordination of treat- ment of mental illness in their patients. The local branches of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Psychological Association should be able to provide a list of mental health professionals who are trained in the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents. "
194,Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,675,"CONSULTATION-LIAISON PSYCHIATRY The field of consultation-liaison psychiatry was developed to address the need for mental health assessment and interven- tion of medically hospitalized pediatric patients. Psychiatric consultation on the medical floor and in the intensive care units can be complex and often requires assessment and intervention beyond the individual patient. The psychiatric consultation, in addition to evaluating the patient’s symp- tom presentation, should also include assessment of family dynamics as related to the patient, and may include evalua- tion of how the medical team is addressing care of the patient and family. The psychiatric consultation focuses on the various hierarchies related to the interaction of the patient and staff, or staff and staff, in addition to the patient per se; this evaluation can be quite enlightening and may lead to more productive interventions. When requesting a psychiatric consultation, as with any medical specialty it is critical that the concern and focus of the consultation request be as specific as possible. Psychiatric consultation on the medical floor is often requested when the patient’s emotional state is affecting his or her response to medical care, or when an underlying mental illness may be contributing to the presenting symptoms. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit or a medical floor after a suicide attempt or supposed unintentional overdose should be eval- uated by a psychiatric consultant before discharge. Another common reason for requesting a psychiatric consultation on the medical floor is change in mental status. Be alert to the likelihood that acute mental status changes in the medical setting can represent delirium, as this has signif- icant assessment and treatment implications. Delirium is defined as an acute and fluctuating disturbance of the senso- rium (ie, alertness and orientation). Delirium can be mani- fested by a variety of psychiatric symptoms including para- noia, hallucinations, anxiety, and mood disturbances. However, aside from dementia and possibly dissociation and malinger- ing, primary psychiatric presentations do not typically involve disturbances of alertness and orientation that are always present in delirium. THE CHRONICALLY ILL CHILD Advances in the treatment of pediatric and adolescent illness have transformed several previously fatal conditions into life-threatening but potentially survivable conditions. These include advances in the fields of neonatal medicine, cardiac surgery, and hematology-oncology, including bone marrow transplantation. Additionally, solid organ transplantation, including heart, liver, kidney, and lung, among others, has revolutionized the potential treatment options for a whole host of once-fatal illnesses. However, the intensity of treatment can in itself be highly stressful and even traumatic physically, financially, and psy- chologically, for children as well as their parents and siblings. Survivors are at risk of long-term medical and psychological sequelae. Those who are fortunate enough to survive the initial treatment of a potentially life-threatening condition often exchange a life-threatening biologic illness for a chronic emotional condition. Phase-Oriented Intervention Psychosocial interventions should vary depending on the developmental level of the patient, siblings, and family, and the phase of the illness. A first crisis is dealt with differently than interventions made during a long course of illness, or a period of stabilization or remission. With this in mind, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing established new by-laws in August 2004 which set minimum requirements for the psychosocial services available as part of an accredited solid organ transplant program. Included in these guidelines is the establishment of a team comprising a transplantation psy- chiatrist, psychologist, nurse practitioner, and psychiatric social worker. Additional guidelines include a formal psychi- atric and substance abuse evaluation of prospective trans- plantation candidates as well as evaluation of any potential renal or hepatic living donors. These guidelines include the availability of individual supportive counseling, crisis inter- vention, support groups, and death, dying, and bereavement counseling to transplantation patients and their families.

Periodically Review Family Coping Families are often so immersed in the crisis of their child’s illness that they neglect their own needs or the needs of other family members. From time to time, the physician should ask “How is everyone doing?” The feelings of the patient, the parents, and other children in the family are explored. Parents should be encouraged to stay in touch with people in their support system, and to encourage their children in such efforts as well. Feelings of fear, guilt, anger, and grief should be monitored and discussed as normal reactions to difficult circumstances. If these experi- ences are interfering with the family’s functioning, involvement of the pediatric social worker or a therapist can be helpful. Appropriate lay support groups for the patient and family should be recommended. Many hospitals have such groups, and hospital social workers can facilitate participation for the patient and family.

198,Psychiatric Disorders of Childhood  & Adolescence,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,3277,"PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS OF  CHILDHOOD & ADOLESCENCE A psychiatric disorder is defined as a characteristic cluster of signs and symptoms (emotions, behaviors, thought patterns, and mood states) that are associated with subjective distress or maladaptive behavior. This definition presumes that the individual’s symptoms are of such intensity, persistence, and duration that the ability to adapt to life’s challenges is compromised. Psychiatric disorders have their origins in neurobiologic, genetic, psychological (life experience), or environmental sources. The neurobiology of childhood disorders is one of the most active areas of investigation in child and adolescent psychiatry. Although much remains to be clarified, data from genetic studies point to heritable transmission of atten- tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders, eating disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, learning disorders, and tic disor- ders, among others. About 3–5% of children and 10–15% of adolescents will experience psychiatric disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) is the formal reference text for psychiatric disorders and includes the criteria for each of the mental illnesses, including those that begin in childhood and adolescence. Psychiatric diagnoses are given on five axes to allow the physician to address the developmental, medical, psychosocial, and overall adaptive issues that contribute to the primary diagnosis on axis I or II. Axis I: Clinical disorders Axis II: Personality disorders, mental retardation, learn- ing disabilities Axis III: General medical conditions Axis IV: Psychosocial and environmental problems Axis V: Global assessment of functioning (on a scale of 0– 100, with 100% being the highest level of functioning) Unfortunately, available mental health classification sys- tems are infrequently used in pediatric primary care settings since they address the more severe and extensive conditions. As previously stated, primary care providers frequently see a spectrum of disturbances in their clinical practice, many not achieving full DSM-IV-TR criteria. In order to combat the fact that current nosologies do not provide enough detail about common problems and situations that primary care pediatric providers come across, the AAP and the American Psychiatric Association (APA) collaboratively developed the DSM-IV Primary Care (DSM-PC), including a child and adolescent version. The key assumptions of the DSM-PC (C&A) are based on the fact that children’s environments have an impact on their mental health, and that children demonstrate a continuum of symptoms from normality to severe disorders. The DSM-PC is compatible with the DSM- IV-TR, is clear and concise, and is available for research testing and subsequent refinement. It is organized into sec-    CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 177 tions covering environmental situations, child manifestations, and severity (Table 6–6). Categories of the major environ- mental factors that may affect a child, ranging from eco- nomic issues to family violence, are described and given V codes. Specific behavioral manifestations are listed under broad groupings and include complaints, definitions, symp- toms, differential diagnosis, developmental variation, and etiology. Severity, in the DSM-PC, has several dimensions including symptoms, functioning, burden of suffering, and risk and protective factors. The DSM-PC has a great deal of promise, not only as a mechanism to classify the complexi- ties of children’s behavior problems, but also as a mechanism for the future to facilitate financial reimbursement for early identification of and intervention for children’s behavioral problems. Pediatricians should find this manual to be a valuable tool in the care of children and their families. The descriptions of disorders in this chapter follow the DSM-IV-TR nosology rather than the DSM-PC criteria. Pediatricians are encouraged to become familiar with the DSM-PC, perhaps mastering one section at a time. A revised DSM-PC is being developed.

199,Pervasive Developmental Disorders  & Autism,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,1572,"PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL  DISORDERS & AUTISM Pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) and childhood autism are early-onset, severe neuropsychiatric disorders that were once referred to as childhood psychoses. PDDs (including autistic disorder) are now distinguished from childhood schizophrenia on the basis of clinical differences and family histories. The term pervasive developmental disorder denotes a group of disorders with the common findings of impairment of socialization skills and characteristic behavioral abnormalities (Table 6–7). Speech and language deficits are common as well. 1. Autistic Disorder ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Severe deficits in social responsiveness and interper- sonal relationships.  Abnormal speech and language development.  Behavioral peculiarities such as ritualized, repetitive, or stereotyped behaviors; rigidity; and poverty of age- typical interests and activities.  Onset in infancy or early childhood (before age 3 years).  General  Considerations Improved identification of autistic disorder has led to earlier interventions as well as confusion about etiology and fear about supposed rising incidence. Autism is more common than was once thought, with an incidence of approximately 16–40 cases per 10,000 school-aged children. More boys than girls are affected (3–4:1). Although the cause of autism is unknown, central nervous system dysfunction is suggested by its higher incidence in populations affected by perinatal disorders: rubella, phenylketonuria, tuberous sclerosis, infan- tile spasms, encephalitis, and fragile X syndrome. Studies of twins reveal over 90% concordance for autistic disorder in Table 6–6. Areas of focus in the Diagnostic  and Statistical Manual, Primary Care (DSM-PC). DSM-PC Section Area of Focus Environmental  situations Challenges to primary support group Changes in caregiving Community or social changes Educational challenges Parent or adolescent occupational challenges Housing challenges Economic challenges Inadequate access to health or mental health  services Legal system or crime problem Other environmental situations Health-related situations Child manifesta- tions Developmental competencies Impulsive, hyperactive, and inattentive behaviors Negative and antisocial behaviors Substance use and abuse Emotions and moods, and emotional behaviors Somatic behaviors Feeding, eating, and elimination Illness-related behaviors Sexual behaviors Atypical behaviors Severity of  disorder Mild Unlikely to cause serious developmental difficul- ties or impairment in functioning Moderate May cause, or is causing, some developmental  difficulties or impairment. Further evaluation and  intervention planning are warranted. Severe Is causing serious developmental difficulties and  dysfunction in one or more key areas of the  child’s life. Mental health referral and compre- hensive treatment planning are often indicated,  possibly on an urgent basis.   CHAPTER 6 180  Prognosis These are lifelong disorders.

202,Mood Disorders,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,624,"MOOD DISORDERS 1. Depression in Children & Adolescents ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Dysphoric mood, mood lability, irritability or depressed appearance, persisting for days to months at a time.  Characteristic neurovegetative signs and symptoms (changes in sleep, appetite, concentration, and activity levels).  Suicidal ideation, feeling of hopelessness.  General Considerations The incidence of depression in children increases with age, from 1–3% before puberty to around 8% for adolescents. The rate of depression in females approaches adult levels by age 15. The lifetime risk of depression ranges from 10–25% for women and 5–12% for men. The incidence of depression in children is higher when other family members have been affected by depressive disorders. The sex incidence is equal in childhood, but with the onset of puberty the rates of depres- sion for females begin to exceed those for males by 5:1.  Clinical Findings Clinical depression can be defined as a persistent state of unhappiness or misery that interferes with pleasure or pro- ductivity. The symptom of depression in children and adoles- cents is as likely to be an irritable mood state accompanied by tantrums or verbal outbursts as it is to be a sad mood. Typically, a child or adolescent with depression begins to look unhappy and may make comments such as “I have no friends,” “Life is boring,” “There is nothing I can do to make things better,” or “I wish I were dead.” A change in behavior patterns usually takes place that includes social isolation, deterioration in schoolwork, loss of interest in usual activities, anger, and irritability. Sleep and appetite patterns commonly change, and the child may complain of tiredness and nonspe- cific pain such as headaches or stomach aches (Table 6–8).  Differential Diagnosis Clinical depression can usually be identified simply by asking about the symptoms. Children are often more accurate than their caregivers in describing their own mood state. When several depressive symptoms cluster together over time, are persistent (2 weeks or more) and cause impairment, a major depressive disorder may be present. When depressive symp- toms are of lesser severity but have persisted for 1 year or more, a diagnosis of dysthymic disorder should be consid- ered. Milder symptoms of short duration in response to some stressful life event may be consistent with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The Center for Epidemiologic Study of Depression–Child Version (CESD-C), Child Depression Inventory (CDI), Beck Depression Rating Scale, and Reynolds Adolescent Depres- sion Scale are self-report rating scales that are easily used in primary care to assist in assessment and monitoring response to treatment. Depression often coexists with other mental illnesses such as ADHD, conduct disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse disorders. Medically ill patients also have an increased incidence of depression. Every child and adolescent with a depressed mood state should be asked directly about suicidal ideation and physical and sexual abuse. Depressed adolescents should also be screened for hypothyroidism and substance abuse.  Complications The risk of suicide is the most significant risk associated with depressive episodes. In addition, adolescents are likely to self- medicate their feelings through substance abuse, or indulge in self-injurious behaviors such as cutting or burning them- selves (without suicidal intent). School performance usually suffers during a depressive episode, as children are unable to Table 6–8. Clinical manifestations of  depression in children and adolescents.

206,Suicide,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,994,"SUICIDE IN CHILDREN & ADOLESCENTS The suicide rate in young people has remained high for several decades. In 2007, suicide was the third leading cause of death among children and adolescents aged 10–24 years in the United States. The suicide rate among adolescents aged 15–19 years quadrupled from approximately 2.7 to 11.3 per 100,000 since the 1960s. It is estimated that each year, approximately 2 million U.S. adolescents attempt suicide, yet only 700,000 receive medical attention for their attempt. Suicide and homi- cide rates for children in the United States are two to five times higher than those for the other 25 industrialized coun- tries combined, primarily due to the prevalence of firearms in the United States. For children younger than 10 years old, the rate of completed suicide is low, but from 1980 to 1992 it increased by 120%, from 0.8 to 1.7 per 100,000. Adolescent girls make three to four times as many suicide attempts as boys of the same age, but the number of completed suicides is three to four times greater in boys. Firearms are the most commonly used method in successful suicides, accounting for 40–60% of cases; hanging, carbon monoxide poisoning, and drug overdoses each account for approximately 10–15% of cases. Suicide is almost always associated with a psychiatric disorder and should not be viewed as a philosophic choice about life or death or as a predictable response to over- whelming stress. Most commonly it is associated with a mood disorder and the hopelessness that accompanies a severe depressive episode. Suicide rates are higher for Native American and Native Alaskan populations than for white, black, and Latinos/Hispanic populations. Although suicide attempts are more common in individuals with a history of behavior problems and academic difficulties, other suicide victims are high achievers who are temperamentally anxious and perfectionistic and who commit suicide impulsively after a failure or rejection, either real or perceived. Mood disorders (in both sexes, but especially in females), substance abuse disorders (especially in males), and conduct disorders are commonly diagnosed at psychological autopsy in adoles- cent suicide victims. Some adolescent suicides reflect an underlying psychotic disorder, with the young person usu- ally committing suicide in response to auditory hallucina- tions or psychotic delusions. The vast majority of young people who attempt suicide give some clue to their distress or their tentative plans to commit suicide. Most show signs of dysphoric mood (anger, irritability, anxiety, or depression). Over 60% make com- ments such as “I wish I were dead” or “I just can’t deal with this any longer” within the 24 hours prior to death. In one study, nearly 70% of subjects experienced a crisis event such as a loss (eg, rejection by a girlfriend or boyfriend), a failure, or an arrest prior to completed suicide. Assessment of Suicide Risk Any clinical assessment for depression must include direct questions about suicidal ideation. If a child or adolescent expresses suicidal thinking, the physician must ask if he or she has an active plan. Suicidal ideation accompanied by any plan warrants immediate referral for a psychiatric crisis assessment. This can usually be accomplished at the nearest emergency department. Assessment of suicide risk calls for a high index of suspicion and a direct interview with the patient and his or her parents or guardians. The highest risk of suicide is among white adolescent boys. High-risk factors include previous suicide attempts, a suicide note, and a viable plan for suicide with the availability of lethal means, close per- sonal exposure to suicide, conduct disorder, and substance abuse. Other risk factors are signs and symptoms of major depression or dysthymia, a family history of suicide, a recent death in the family, and a view of death as a relief from the pain in the patient’s life. Intervention Suicidal ideation and any suicide attempt must be consid- ered a serious matter. The patient should not be left alone, and the physician should express concern and convey a desire to help. The physician should meet with the patient and the family, both alone and together, and listen carefully to their problems and perceptions. It should be made clear that with the assistance of mental health professionals, solu- tions can be found. The majority of patients who express suicidal ideation and all who have made a suicide attempt should be referred for psychiatric evaluation and possible hospitalization. Most providers feel uncomfortable and have little experience in evaluating suicidality and risk. In addition, this evaluation frequently takes considerable time and requires contact with multiple informants. The physician should err on the side of caution as referral for further assessment is always appropriate when there is concern about suicidal thinking and behavior.   CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 185 An evaluation in a psychiatrist’s office or the emergency department will help determine level of risk and disposition. If the patient has suicidal ideation without a plan, has a therapist he or she can see the next day, is able to “contract for safety,” and the family is able to provide supervision and support, then the evaluating physician can consider sending the patient and family home that day from the office or emergency department without need for hospitalization. If there appears to be potential for suicide as determined by suicidal ideation with a plan, there are no available resources for therapy, and the patient is not able to cooperate with a plan to ensure safety; if the patient is severely depressed or intoxicated; if the family does not appear to be appropriately concerned; or if there are practical limitations on providing supervision and support to ensure safety, the individual should be hospitalized on an inpatient psychiatric unit. Any decision to send the patient home from the emergency department without hospitalization should be made only after consultation with a mental health expert. The decision should be based on lessening of the risk of suicide and assurance of the family’s ability to follow through with outpa- tient therapy and provide appropriate support and supervi- sion. Guns, knives, and razor blades should be removed from the home, and as much as possible, access to them outside the home must be denied. Medications and over-the-counter drugs should be kept locked in a safe place with all efforts made to minimize the risk of the patient having access (eg, key kept with a parent, or use of combination lock on the medicine chest). The patient should be restricted from driving for at least the first 24 hours to lessen the chance of impulsive motor vehicle crashes. Instructions and phone numbers for crisis services should be given, and the family must be com- mitted to a plan for mental health treatment. Suicide prevention efforts include heightened awareness in the community and schools to promote identification of at-risk individuals and increasing access to services, includ- ing hotlines and counseling services. Restricting young peo- ple’s access to firearms is also a critical factor, as firearms are responsible for 85% of deaths due to suicide or homicide in youth in the United States. Finally, the physician should be aware of his or her own emotional reactions to dealing with suicidal adolescents and their families. Because the assessment can require considerable time and energy, the physician should be on guard against becoming tired, irritable, or angry. The physician should not be afraid of precipitating suicide by direct and frank discus- sions of suicidal risk. Reviewing difficult cases with colleagues, developing formal or informal relationships with psychiatrists, and attending workshops on assessment and management of depression and suicidal ideation can decrease the anxiety and improve competence for primary care providers.

207,Adjustment Disorders,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,4374,"ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS The most frequent and most disturbing stresses for children and adolescents are marital discord, separation and divorce, family illness, the loss of a loved one, a change of residence, and for adolescents, peer relationship problems. When faced with stress, children can experience many different symp- toms, including changes in mood, changes in behavior, anxi- ety symptoms, and physical complaints. Key findings for the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder include the following: • The precipitating event or circumstance is identifiable. • The symptoms have appeared within 3 months after the occurrence of the stressful event. • Although the child experiences distress or some func- tional impairment, the reaction is not severe or disabling. • The reaction does not persist more than 6 months after the stressor has terminated.  Differential Diagnosis When symptoms are a reaction to an identifiable stressor but are severe, persistent, or disabling, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and conduct disorders must be considered.  Treatment The mainstay of treatment is the physician’s genuine empathy and assurance to the parents and the patient that the emotional or behavioral change is a predictable consequence of the stress- ful event. This validates the child’s reaction and encourages the child to talk about the stressful occurrence and its aftermath. Parents are encouraged to help the child with appropriate verbal expression of feelings, while defining boundaries for behavior that prevent the child from feeling out of control.  Prognosis The duration of symptoms in adjustment reactions depends on the severity of the stress; the child’s personal sensitivity to   CHAPTER 6 186 stress and vulnerability to anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders; and the available support system. "
208,Schizophrenia,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,132,"SCHIZOPHRENIA The incidence of schizophrenia is about 1 per 10,000 per year. The onset of schizophrenia is typically between the middle to late teens and early 30s, with onset before puberty being relatively rare. Symptoms usually begin after puberty, although a full “psychotic break” may not occur until the young adult years. Childhood onset (before puberty) of psychotic symptoms due to schizophrenia is uncommon and usually indicates a more severe form of the spectrum of schizophrenic disorders. Childhood-onset schizophrenia is more likely to be found in boys. Schizophrenia is a biologically based disease with a strong genetic component. Other psychotic disorders that may be encountered in childhood or adolescence include schizoaffec- tive disorder and psychosis not otherwise specified (psychosis NOS). Psychosis NOS may be used as a differential diagnosis when psychotic symptoms are present, but the cluster of symptoms is not consistent with a schizophrenia diagnosis. ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Delusional thoughts.  Disorganized speech (rambling or illogical speech pat- terns).  Disorganized or bizarre behavior.  Hallucinations (auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory).  Paranoia, ideas of reference.  Negative symptoms (ie, flat affect, avolition, alogia).  Clinical Findings Children and adolescents display many of the symptoms of adult schizophrenia. Hallucinations or delusions, bizarre and morbid thought content, and rambling and illogical speech are typical. Affected individuals tend to withdraw into an internal world of fantasy and may then equate fantasy with external reality. They generally have difficulty with school- work and with peer relationships. Adolescents may have a prodromal period of depression prior to the onset of psy- chotic symptoms. The majority of patients with childhood- onset schizophrenia have had nonspecific psychiatric symp- toms or symptoms of delayed development for months or years prior to the onset of their overtly psychotic symptoms.  Differential Diagnosis Obtaining the family history of mental illness is critical when assessing children and adolescents with psychotic symptoms. Psychological testing is often helpful in identifying or ruling out psychotic thought processes. Psychotic symptoms in children younger than age 8 years must be differentiated from manifestations of normal vivid fantasy life or abuse- related symptoms. Children with psychotic disorders often have learning disabilities and attention difficulties in addi- tion to disorganized thoughts, delusions, and hallucinations. In psychotic adolescents, mania is differentiated by high levels of energy, excitement, and irritability. Any child or adolescent exhibiting new psychotic symptoms requires a medical evaluation that includes physical and neurologic examinations (including consideration of magnetic reso- nance imaging and electroencephalogram), drug screening, and metabolic screening for endocrinopathies, Wilson dis- ease, and delirium.  Treatment The treatment of childhood and adolescent schizophrenia focuses on four main areas: (1) decreasing active psychotic symptoms, (2) supporting development of social and cogni- tive skills, (3) reducing the risk of relapse of psychotic symp- toms, and (4) providing support and education to parents and family members. Antipsychotic medications (neurolep- tics) are the primary psychopharmacologic intervention. In addition, a supportive, reality-oriented focus in relationships can help to reduce hallucinations, delusions, and frightening thoughts. A special school or day treatment environment may be necessary depending on the child’s or adolescent’s ability to tolerate the school day and classroom activities. Support for the family emphasizes the importance of clear, focused communication and an emotionally calm climate in prevent- ing recurrences of overtly psychotic symptoms.  Prognosis Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder with exacerbations and remissions of psychotic symptoms. It is generally believed that earlier onset (prior to age 13 years), poor premorbid functioning (oddness or eccentricity), and predominance of negative symptoms (withdrawal, apathy, or flat affect) over positive symptoms (hallucinations or paranoia) predict more severe disability, while later age of onset, normal social and school functioning prior to onset, and predominance of positive symptoms are generally associated with better out- comes and life adjustment to the illness.

209,Conduct Disorders,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,548,"CONDUCT DISORDERS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  A persistent pattern of behavior that includes the following: • Defiance of authority. • Violating the rights of others or society’s norms. • Aggressive behavior toward persons, animals, or property.  General Considerations Disorders of conduct affect approximately 9% of males and 2% of females younger than 18 years. This is a very heteroge- neous population, and overlap occurs with ADHD, sub- stance abuse, learning disabilities, neuropsychiatric disor- ders, mood disorders, and family dysfunction. Many of these individuals come from homes where domestic violence, child abuse, drug abuse, shifting parental figures, and pov- erty are environmental risk factors. Although social learning partly explains this correlation, the genetic heritability of aggressive conduct and antisocial behaviors is currently under investigation.  Clinical Findings The typical child with conduct disorder is a boy with a turbulent home life and academic difficulties. Defiance of authority, fighting, tantrums, running away, school failure, and destruction of property are common symptoms. With increasing age, fire-setting and theft may occur, followed in adolescence by truancy, vandalism, and substance abuse. Sexual promiscuity, sexual perpetration, and other criminal behaviors may develop. Hyperactive, aggressive, and unco- operative behavior patterns in the preschool and early school years tend to predict conduct disorder in adolescence with a high degree of accuracy, especially when ADHD goes untreated. A history of reactive attachment disorder is an additional childhood risk factor. The risk for conduct disor- der increases with inconsistent and severe parental disciplin- ary techniques, parental alcoholism, and parental antisocial behavior.  Differential Diagnosis Young people with conduct disorders, especially those with more violent histories, have an increased incidence of neuro- logic signs and symptoms, psychomotor seizures, psychotic symptoms, mood disorders, ADHD, and learning disabili- ties. Efforts should be made to identify these associated disorders (see Table 6–10) because they may suggest specific therapeutic interventions. Conduct disorder is best concep- tualized as a final common pathway emerging from a variety of underlying psychosocial, genetic, environmental, and neuropsychiatric conditions.  Treatment Effective treatment can be complicated by the psychosocial problems often found in the lives of children and adolescents with conduct disorders, and the related difficulty achieving compliance with treatment recommendations. Efforts should be made to stabilize the environment and improve function- ing within the home, particularly as it relates to parental functioning and disciplinary techniques. Identification of learning disabilities and placement in an optimal school envi- ronment is also critical. Any associated neurologic and psychi- atric disorders should be addressed. Residential treatment may be needed for some individu- als whose symptoms do not respond to lower level interven- tions, or whose environment is not able to meet their needs for supervision and structure. It is not unusual for the juvenile justice system to be involved when conduct disorder behaviors lead to illegal activities, theft, or assault. Medications such as mood stabilizers, neuroleptics, stim- ulants, and antidepressants have all been studied in youth with conduct disorders, yet none has been found to be consistently effective in this population. Early involvement in programs such as Big Brothers, Big Sisters, scouts, and team sports in which consistent adult mentors and role models interact with youth decreases the chances that the youth with conduct disorders will develop antisocial person- ality disorder. Multisystemic therapy (MST) is being used increasingly as an intervention for youth with conduct disor- ders and involvement with the legal system. Multisystemic therapy is an intensive home-based model of care that seeks to stabilize and improve the home environment and to strengthen the support system and coping skills of the individual and family.  Prognosis The prognosis is based on the ability of the child’s support system to mount an effective treatment intervention consis- tently over time. The prognosis is generally worse for chil- dren in whom the disorder presents before age 10 years; those who display a diversity of antisocial behaviors across multiple settings; and those who are raised in an environ- ment characterized by parental antisocial behavior, alcohol- ism or other substance abuse, and conflict.

Anxiety-Based School Refusal  (School Avoidance) ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  A persistent pattern of school avoidance related to symptoms of anxiety.  Somatic symptoms on school mornings, with symptoms resolving if the child is allowed to remain at home.  No organic medical disorder that accounts for the symptoms.  High levels of parental anxiety are commonly observed.  General Considerations Anxiety-based school refusal should be considered if a child presents with a medically unexplained absence from school for more than 2 weeks. Anxiety-based school refusal is a persistent behavioral symptom rather than a diagnostic entity. It refers to a pattern of school nonattendance resulting from anxiety, which may be related to a dread of leaving home (separation anxiety), a fear of some aspect of school, or a fear of feeling exposed or embarrassed at school (social phobia). In all cases, a realistic cause of the fear (eg, an intimidating teacher or a playground bully) should be ruled out. In most cases, anxiety- based school refusal is related to developmentally inappropri- ate separation anxiety. The incidence between males and females is about equal, and there are peaks of incidence at ages 6–7 years, again at ages 10–11 years, and in early adolescence.  Clinical Findings In the preadolescent years, school refusal often begins after some precipitating stress in the family. The child’s anxiety is then manifested either as somatic symptoms or in displacement of anxiety onto some aspect of the school environment. The somatic manifestations of anxiety include dizziness, nausea, and stomach distress. Characteristically, the symptoms become more severe as the time to leave for school approaches and then remit if the child is allowed to remain at home for the day. In older children, the onset is more insidious and often associated with social withdrawal and depression. The incidence of anxiety and mood disorders is increased in these families.  Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of school nonattendance is pre- sented in Table 6–11. Medical disorders that may be causing the somatic symptoms must be ruled out. Children with learning disorders may wish to stay home to avoid the sense of failure they experience at school. Children may also have transient episodes of wanting to stay at home during times of significant family stress or loss. The onset of school avoid- ance in middle or late adolescence may be related to the onset of schizophrenia. Children who are avoiding school for reasons related to oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder can be differentiated on the basis of their chronic noncompliance with adult authority and their preference for being with peers rather than at home.  Complications The longer a child remains out of school, the more difficult it is to return and the more strained the relationship between Table 6-11.

Many parents of nonattending children feel tyrannized by their defiant, clinging child. Children often feel accused of making up their symptoms, leading to further antagonism between the child, parents, and medical caregivers.  Treatment Once the comorbid diagnoses and situations related to school avoidance or refusal have been identified and interventions begun (ie, educational assessment if learning disabilities are suspected, medication if necessary for depression or anxiety, or addressing problems in the home), the goal of treatment is to help the child confront anxiety and overcome it by return- ing to school. This requires a strong alliance between the parents and the health care provider. The parent must under- stand that no underlying medical disorder exists, that the child’s symptoms are a manifestation of anxiety, and that the basic problem is anxiety that must be faced to be overcome. Parents must be reminded that being good parents in this case means helping a child cope with a distressing experience. Children must be reassured that their symptoms are caused by worry and that they will be overcome on return to school. A plan for returning the child to school is then developed with parents and school personnel. Firm insistence on full compliance with this plan is essential. The child is brought to school by someone not likely to give in, such as the father or an older sibling. If symptoms develop at school, the child should be checked by the school nurse and then returned to class after a brief rest. The parents must be reassured that school staff will handle the situation at school and that school personnel can reach the primary health care provider if any questions arise. If these interventions are ineffective, increased involve- ment of a therapist and consideration of a day treatment program may be necessary. For children with persistent symptoms of separation that do not improve with behavioral interventions, medications such as SSRIs should be consid- ered. Comorbid diagnoses of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or major depression should be carefully screened for, and if identified, treated appropriately.  Prognosis The vast majority of preadolescent children improve signifi- cantly with behavioral interventions and return to school. The prognosis is worsened by the length of time the child remains out of school. Long-term outcomes are influenced by comorbid diagnoses and responsiveness to behavioral or medication interventions. A history of school refusal is more common in adults with panic and anxiety disorders and agoraphobia than in the general population.

The characteristics of anxiety disorders in child- hood are listed in Table 6–13. Community-based studies of school-aged children and adolescents suggest that nearly 10% of children have some type of anxiety disorder. The differential diagnosis of symptoms of anxiety is presented in Table 6–14. The evaluation of anxiety symptoms in children must consider the age of the child, the developmental fears that can normally be expected at that age, the form of the symptoms and their duration, and the degree to which the symptoms disrupt the child’s life. The family and school environment should be evaluated for potential stressors, marital discord, family violence, harsh or inappropriate disciplinary methods, sexual abuse, neglect, and emotional overstimulation. The child’s experience of anxiety and its relationship to life events should be explored, and therapy to incorporate specific cogni- tive and behavioral techniques to diminish the anxiety should be recommended. Finally, when panic attacks or anxiety symptoms do not remit with cognitive, behavioral, and envi- ronmental interventions, and they significantly affect life func- tioning, psychopharmacologic agents may be helpful. SSRIs may be effective across a broad spectrum of anxiety symptoms. Table 6–12. Signs and symptoms of anxiety in children.

The essential features of OCD are recurrent obsessions or compulsions that are severe enough to be time-consuming or cause marked distress and functional impairment. Obsessions are persistent ideas, thoughts, or impulses that are intrusive and often inappropriate. Children may have obsessions about contamination or cleanliness; ordering and compulsive behaviors will follow, such as frequent hand-washing, count- ing, or ordering objects. The goal of the compulsive behavior for the individual with OCD is to reduce anxiety and distress. There may be significant avoidance of situations due to obsessive thoughts or fears of contamination. OCD is often associated with major depressive disorder. OCD is a biologi- cally based disease and has a strong genetic/familial compo- nent. Pediatric autoimmune disorders associated with group B streptococci have also been implicated in the development of OCD for some children. The prevalence of OCD is estimated to be around 2%, and the rates are equal between males and females. Trichotillomania, while technically classified as an impulse disorder, is also thought to be related to OCD. It involves the recurrent pulling out of hair, often to the point of bald patches, and can also involve pulling out eyelashes, eyebrows, and hair from any part of the body. Trichotillomania should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient with alopecia. Treatment often includes the same medications used to treat OCD, and behavior therapy to decrease hair-pulling and restore normal social functioning.  Treatment OCD is best treated with a combination of cognitive-behav- ioral therapy specific to OCD and medications in more severe cases. SSRIs are effective in diminishing OCD symp- toms. Fluvoxamine and sertraline have FDA approval for the treatment of pediatric OCD. The tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clomipramine has FDA approval for the treatment of OCD in adults.  Prognosis Although OCD is usually a lifelong condition, most individ- uals can achieve significant remission of symptoms with the combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medica- tions. A minority of individuals with OCD are completely disabled by their symptoms.

216,Somatoform Disorders,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,658,"SOMATOFORM DISORDERS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  A symptom suggesting physical dysfunction.  No physical disorder accounting for the symptom.  Symptoms causing distress, dysfunction, or both.  Symptoms not voluntarily created or maintained, as in malingering.  Clinical Findings Hypochondriasis, somatization, and conversion disorders involve an unhealthy overemphasis and preoccupation with somatic experiences and symptoms. Somatoform disorders are defined by the presence of physical illness or disability for which no organic cause can be identified, although neither the patient nor the caregiver is consciously fabricating the symptoms. The category includes body dysmorphic disor- der, conversion disorder, hypochondriasis, somatization dis- order, and somatoform pain disorder (Table 6–15). Conversion symptoms most often occur in school-aged children and adolescents. The exact incidence is unclear, but in pediatric practice they are probably seen more often as transient symptoms than as chronic disorders requiring help from mental health practitioners. A conversion symptom is thought to be an expression of underlying psychological conflict. The specific symptom may be symbolically deter- mined by the underlying conflict; the symptom may resolve the dilemma created by the underlying wish or fear (eg, a seemingly paralyzed child need not fear expressing his underlying rage or aggressive retaliatory impulses). Although children can present with a variety of symptoms, the most common include neurologic and gastrointestinal com- plaints. Children with conversion disorder may be surpris- ingly unconcerned about the substantial disability deriving from their symptoms. Symptoms include unusual sensory phenomena, paralysis, vomiting, abdominal pain, intractable headaches, and movement or seizure-like disorders. In the classic case of conversion disorder, the child’s symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with the clinical manifestations of any organic disease process. The physical symptoms often begin within the context of a family experiencing stress, such as serious illness, a death, or family discord. On closer examination, the child’s symptoms are often found to resemble symptoms present in other family members. Children with conversion disorder may have some secondary gain associated with their symptoms. Several reports have pointed to the increased association of conver- sion disorder with sexual overstimulation or sexual abuse. As with other emotional and behavioral problems, health care providers should always screen for physical and sexual abuse.  Differential Diagnosis It is sometimes not possible to rule out medical disease as a source of the symptoms. Medical follow-up is required to monitor for changes in symptoms and response to recom- mended interventions. Somatic symptoms are often associated with anxiety and depressive disorders (see Tables 6–8 and 6–12). Occasion- ally, psychotic children have somatic preoccupations and even somatic delusions.  Treatment & Prognosis In most cases, conversion symptoms resolve quickly when the child and family are reassured that the symptom is a way of reacting to stress. The child is encouraged to continue with normal daily activities, knowing that the symptom will abate when the stress is resolved. Treatment of conversion disorders includes acknowledging the symptom rather than telling the child that the symptom is not medically justified Table 6–15. Somatoform disorders in  children and adolescents. Disorder Major Clinical Manifestations Body dysmorphic  disorder Preoccupation with an imagined defect in per- sonal appearance Conversion  disorder Symptom onset follows psychologically stress- ful event; symptoms express unconscious feel- ings and result in secondary gain Hypochondriasis Preoccupation with worry that physical symp- toms manifest unrecognized and threatening  condition; medical assurance does not provide  relief from worry Somatization  disorder Long-standing preoccupation with multiple  somatic symptoms Somatoform pain  disorder Preoccupation with pain that results in distress  or impairment beyond what would be expected  from physical findings   CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 195 and responding with noninvasive interventions such as physical therapy while continuing to encourage normaliza- tion of the symptoms. If the symptom does not resolve with reassurance, further investigation by a mental health profes- sional is indicated. Comorbid diagnoses such as depression and anxiety disorders should be addressed, and treatment with psychopharmacologic agents may be helpful. Patients presenting with somatoform disorders are often resistant to mental health treatment, in part fearing that any distraction from their vigilance will put them at greater risk of succumbing to a medical illness. Psychiatric consultation is often helpful and for severely incapacitated patients, refer- ral psychiatric consultation is always indicated. Somatoform disorder is not associated with the increased morbidity and mortality associated with other psychiatric disorders such as mood disorders or psychotic illness. Somatoform patients are best treated with regular, short, scheduled medical appointments to address the complaints at hand. In this way they do not need to precipitate emergen- cies to elicit medical attention. Avoid invasive procedures unless clearly indicated and offer sincere concern and reas- surance. Avoid telling the patient “it’s all in your head” and do not abandon or avoid the patient, as somatoform patients are at great risk of seeking multiple alternative treatment providers and potentially unnecessary treatments.

217,Elimination Disorders,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,2184,"ELIMINATION DISORDERS Elimination disorders are defined as problems with age-appro- priate bowel and bladder control. These disorders are often identified and addressed by primary care providers. Enuresis and encopresis are not always associated with mental health problems and can simply be due to delayed development of consistent bowel and bladder control, or parental difficulty in managing this developmental stage. Elimination disorders may also be treated by child psychiatrists when they are found to be comorbid with other mental health problems, such as PTSD, anxiety disorders, and developmental disabilities. 1. Enuresis It is important for the primary care provider to carefully assess the developmental age of the child and the situation in which enuresis is occurring, and to screen for medical concerns before deciding that the enuresis or encopresis is attributable to a behavioral or emotional disorder. It is not uncommon for parents to have unrealistic expectations about toilet training young children. In many cases of enuresis, the child is simply not developmentally ready or sometimes is unable to remain dry at night. Most children with enuresis are able to remain dry by age 9 years. ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Urinary incontinence in a child age 5 years (or devel- opmental equivalent) or older.  Not due to medication or a medical disorder.  General Considerations Enuresis is the passage of urine into bedclothes or undergar- ments, whether involuntary or intentional. At least 90% of enuretic children have primary nocturnal enuresis—that is, they wet only at night during sleep and have never had a sustained period of dryness. Diurnal enuresis (daytime wet- ting) is much less common, as is secondary enuresis, which develops after a child has had a sustained period of bladder control. The latter two varieties are much more commonly associated with emotional stress, anxiety, and psychiatric disorders. Primary nocturnal enuresis is most often a para- somnia, a deep-sleep (stage 3 or stage 4) event. Etiologically, it is generally viewed as a developmental disorder or matura- tional lag that children will outgrow. Only infrequently is it associated with a serious psychopathologic disorder.  Clinical Findings Primary nocturnal enuresis is common (Table 6–16). The incidence is three times higher in boys than in girls. Most children with enuresis become continent by adolescence or earlier. The family history in such cases frequently reveals other members, especially fathers, who have had prolonged nighttime bedwetting problems. Although the cause of pri- mary nocturnal enuresis is not established, it appears to be related to maturational delay of sleep and arousal mechanisms or to delay in development of increased bladder capacity. Daytime wetting most often occurs in timid and shy children or in children with ADHD. It occurs with about equal frequency in boys and girls, and 60–80% of daytime wetters also wet at night. Secondary enuresis typically follows a stressful event, such as the birth of a sibling, a loss, or discord within the family. The symptom can be seen as the result of regression in response to stress or as a more symbolic expression of the child’s feelings.  Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes urinary tract infections, neurologic diseases, seizure disorders, diabetes mellitus, and   CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 197 B. Continuous Encopresis Children with continuous encopresis have never gained primary control of bowel function. The bowel movement is usually randomly deposited in underclothing without regard to social norms. Typically, the family structure does not encourage organization and skill training, and for that rea- son the child has never had adequate bowel training. These children and their parents are more apt to be socially or intellectually disadvantaged. C. Discontinuous Encopresis Children with discontinuous encopresis have a history of normal bowel control for an extended period. Loss of control often occurs in response to a stressful event, such as the birth of a sibling, a separation, family illness, or marital dishar- mony. These children may soil their pants or on occasion defecate on the floor or smear feces as an expression of anger or of a wish to be perceived as younger. They typically display relative indifference to the symptom. D. Toilet Phobia In the infrequent case of toilet phobia, a young child views the toilet as a frightening structure to be avoided. These children may view the bowel movement as an extension of themselves, which is then swept away in a frightening manner. They may think that they, too, may be swept away down the toilet.  Differential Diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes the medical causes of consti- pation and retentive encopresis. Hirschsprung disease can be ruled out with reasonable certainty by the history of passing large-caliber bowel movements in the past and by the pres- ence of palpable stool in the rectal vault. Neurologic disor- ders, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, and diseases of smooth muscle must be considered as well. The child should be examined for anal fissures, which tend to encourage the withholding of bowel movements.  Treatment Identifying the type of encopresis is important in treatment planning. Another important variable is the child’s own concern about the symptom. Encopresis in children who display denial or indifference is much harder to treat. Chil- dren with coexisting illnesses need to receive treatment for those conditions before focusing treatment on soiling. Par- ents should be given guidance on responding calmly and firmly to this behavior. With the most common type of encopresis, the retentive type, efforts are made to soften stool so that constipation and painful defecation do not perpetuate the behavior. These children are then taught to adopt a regular schedule of sitting on the toilet after meals. A system of positive reinforcement can be added in which the child is rewarded for each day with no soiled underclothes. The responsibility for rinsing soiled clothing and depositing it in the appropriate receptacle rests with the child. In the case of continuous encopresis, the family is taught to train the child. For toilet phobia, a progressive series of rewarded desensitization steps is neces- sary. Children with discontinuous encopresis that persists over several weeks often need psychotherapy to help them recognize and verbally express their anger and wish to be dependent, rather than express themselves through fecal soiling.  Prognosis Although the ultimate prognosis is excellent, parental dis- tress and parent-child conflict may be substantial prior to the cessation of symptoms. The natural history of soiling is that it resolves by adolescence in all but the most severely dis- turbed teenagers. Bonner L, Dobson P: Children who soil: Guidelines for good practice.

219,Overview of Pediatric Psychopharmacology,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,4727,"OVERVIEW OF PEDIATRIC  PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY Pediatric psychopharmacology has improved significantly over the past decade with increasing study of the effect of psychoac- tive medications on mental illness in childhood and adoles- cence. Although relatively few medications are approved for use in children, many of the same psychopharmacologic agents used in adults are used in children and adolescents.    CHAPTER 6 198 As with any medication, the risks as well as the benefits of administering psychoactive medications must be dis- cussed with the child’s parent or guardian and with the child or adolescent, as is age-appropriate. A recommenda- tion for medication is warranted if the symptoms observed and reported by the child and family are associated with a psychiatric diagnosis known to respond to a particular medication or class of medications. Medication is more likely to be recommended if the disorder is interfering with psychosocial development, interpersonal relationships, daily functioning, or the patient’s sense of personal well- being, and if there is significant potential for benefit with the medication and relatively low risk of harm. Informed consent should be given by the parent or guardian and noted in the record. The recommendation and target symptoms for medication should be discussed with both children and adolescents, and adolescents should also pro- vide informed consent for treatment. In some states adoles- cents aged 15 and older must give informed consent. Informed consent includes a discussion of the diagnosis, target symptoms, possible common side effects, any side effects that should be closely monitored, potential benefits associated with the medication, and documentation of informed consent in the medical record. Psychopharmaco- logic agents are seldom the only treatment for a psychiatric disorder. They are best used in combination with other interventions such as individual therapy, family psycho- therapy, and other psychosocial interventions, including assessment of school functioning and special needs. When considering the use of psychoactive medications, specific target symptoms of the medication should be identi- fied and followed to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. These symptoms should be also measured either by self-report rating scales (child, family, or both) and clinician-rated scales. When initiating treatment, start with low doses and increase slowly (in divided doses, if indicated) while moni- toring for side effects along with therapeutic effects. When a medication is discontinued, it should usually be tapered over 2–4 weeks to minimize withdrawal effects. When multiple choices exist, one should select the medication that has a pediatric FDA approval (Table 6–17), or has been studied for the specific indication for which it is being prescribed, ideally in the age range of the patient. The side-effect profile of each option should be carefully considered, and the medication selected with the fewest and least serious risks and side effects. Polypharmacy should be avoided by choosing one drug that might diminish most or all of the target symptoms before considering the simultaneous administration of two or more agents. General guidelines regarding comfort level for pediatric providers in initiating and managing psycho- tropic classes of medications are outlined in Table 6–18. In the text that follows, the major classes of psychophar- macologic agents with clinical indications in child and ado- lescent psychiatry are represented. The more commonly prescribed drugs from each class are reviewed with reference to indications, relative contraindications, initial medical screening procedures (in addition to a general pediatric examination), dosage, adverse effects, drug interactions, and medical follow-up recommendations.

Indications—Approximately 75% of children with ADHD experience improved attention span, decreased hyperactivity, and decreased impulsivity when given stimulant medica- tions. Children with ADHD who do not respond favorably to one stimulant may respond well to another. Children and adolescents with ADHD without prominent hyperactivity (ADHD, predominantly inattentive type) are also likely to be responsive to stimulant medications. Atomoxetine (Strat- tera) and bupropion (Wellbutrin) are nonstimulant medica- tions used to treat ADHD. Atomoxetine has FDA approval for the treatment of ADHD and is a selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor. Bupropion is primarily used as an antide- pressant, and blocks serotonin, dopamine, and norepineph- rine reuptake. 2. Contraindications—Although there has been much debate about stimulants causing sudden death in children, the FDA reviewed the literature and found no risk, except in cases of an underlying cardiac conduction or structural abnormality. Stimulants should also be used cautiously in individuals with a personal or family history of motor tics or Tourette syndrome, as these medications may cause or worsen motor tics. Caution should also be taken if there is a personal or family history of substance abuse or addictive disorders, as these medications can be abused or sold as drugs of abuse. Stimulants are also contraindicated for indi- viduals with psychotic disorders, as they can significantly worsen psychotic symptoms. Stimulants should be used with caution in individuals with comorbid bipolar affective disor- der and ADHD and consideration of concurrent mood stabilization is critical. 3. Initial medical screening—The child should be observed for involuntary movements. Height, weight, pulse, and blood pressure should be recorded. (See also Chapter 2.) 4. Adverse effects—These are often dose-related and time- limited. a. Common adverse effects—Anorexia, weight loss, abdom- inal distress, headache, insomnia, dysphoria and tearfulness, irritability, lethargy, mild tachycardia, and mild elevation in blood pressure. b. Less common effects—Interdose rebound of ADHD symptoms, emergence of motor tics or Tourette syndrome, behavioral stereotypy, tachycardia or hypertension, depres- sion, mania, and psychotic symptoms. Reduced growth velocity occurs only during active administration. Growth rebound occurs during periods of discontinuation. Ultimate height is not usually noticeably compromised. Treatment with stimulant medications does not predispose to future substance abuse. 5. Drug interactions—Additive stimulant effects are seen with sympathomimetic amines (ephedrine and pseudoephe- drine). 6. Medical follow-up—Pulse, blood pressure, height, and weight should be recorded every 3–4 months and at times of dosage increases. Assess for abnormal movements such as motor tics at each visit. 7. Dosage a. Methylphenidate—The usual starting dose is 5 mg once or twice a day, before school and at noon (or 2.5 mg twice a day for children aged 4–6 years), gradually increasing as clinically indicated. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 60 mg, and a single dose should not exceed 0.7 mg/kg. Administration on weekends and during vacations is deter- mined by the need at those times. The duration of action is approximately 3–4 hours. Extended-release forms can prevent the need for taking medication at school. Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) is typically administered at a dose of 2.5 mg twice a day (8 AM and noon, for example), to a maximum of 20 mg. b. Dextroamphetamine sulfate—The dose is 2.5–10 mg twice daily, before school and at noon, with or without another dose at 4 PM. A sustained-release preparation may have clinical effects for up to 8 hours. There is also an extended-release form. c. Pemoline—Pemoline is generally not recommended for the treatment of ADHD due to a significant risk of liver failure. d. Atomoxetine hydrochloride—The starting dose for children and adolescents up to 70 kg is 0.5 mg/kg, with titration to a maximum dose of 1.2 mg/kg, in single or divided dosing. Table 6–18.

222,Antidepressents,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,," CHAPTER 6 200 ANTIDEPRESSANTS The “black box warning” that was issued in October 2005 for all antidepressants has had a significant impact on prescrip- tion of these medications for children. The black box warn- ing reads “Pooled analysis of short term (4–16 weeks) pla- cebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) in children and adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and other psychiatric disorders (a total of 24 trials involving more than 4400 patients) has revealed a greater risk of adverse events representing suicidal thinking or behavior (suicidality) during the first few months of treatment in those receiving antidepressants. The average risk of such events was 4%, twice the placebo risk of 2%. No suicides occurred in these trials.” The “medication guide” created for consumers along with the black box warning that now appears in all antide- pressant packaging recommends the following monitoring schedule for health care providers when starting an antide- pressant: • Once every week for the first 4 weeks • Every 2 weeks for the next 4 weeks • After taking the antidepressant for 12 weeks • After 12 weeks, follow your health care provider’s advice on how often to come back. The Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy combined with fluoxetine led to the best outcomes in the treatment of pediatric depression. It is important to be cognizant of evidence-based medical practice when prescribing for any indication. Target symp- toms should be carefully monitored for improvement or worsening, and it is important to ask and document the responses about any suicidal thinking and self-injurious behaviors. When recommending an antidepressant, the phy- sician should also firmly recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy and discuss the options for medication treatment, including which medications have FDA approval for pediat- ric indications (see Table 6–17). Recent findings suggest that fluoxetine has the best evidence for improvement in depres- sive symptoms. 1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Citalopram, escitalopram (Celexa, Lexapro) Fluvoxamine (Luvox) Paroxetine (Paxil) Sertraline (Zoloft) 1. Indications—The SSRIs have become the agents of first choice for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Fluvox- amine and sertraline both have approval from the FDA for treatment of pediatric OCD and fluoxetine has approval for pediatric depression. Although no other SSRIs have FDA approval for pediatric indications, some published studies support the efficacy of SSRIs for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and OCD in pediatric populations. Each SSRI has different FDA indications. However, once an indication is obtained for one SSRI, it is widely believed that other SSRIs are likely to be effective as well for the same indication. The FDA-approved indications for SSRIs are the following: Major depression: fluoxetine (age 6 years and older); citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline (18 and older). Panic disorder: sertraline (18 and older), paroxetine (18 and older). OCD: fluvoxamine (6 and older), sertraline (6 and older). Bulimia: fluoxetine (18 and older). PTSD: sertraline (18 and older). Premenstrual dysphoric disorder: fluoxetine (18 and older). 2. Contraindications—Caution should be used in cases of known liver disease or chronic or severe illness where multi- ple medications may be prescribed, because all SSRIs are metabolized in the liver. Caution should be used when prescribing for an individual with a family history of bipolar disorder, or when the differential diagnosis includes bipolar disorder, because antidepressants can induce manic or hypomanic symptoms. 3. Initial medical screening—General medical examination. 4. Adverse effects—Often dose-related and time-limited: gastrointestinal (GI) distress and nausea (can be minimized by taking medication with food), headache, tremulousness, decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, sedation (10%), sexual dysfunction (25%). Irritability, social disinhibition, restlessness, and emotional excitability can occur in approx- imately 20% of children taking SSRIs. Monitor for improve- ment and onset or worsening of suicidal or self-injurious thinking, in addition to other target symptoms. 5. Drug interactions—All SSRIs inhibit the efficiency of the hepatic microsomal enzyme system. The order of inhibition is: fluoxetine > fluvoxamine > paroxetine > sertraline > citalopram > escitalopram. This can lead to higher-than- expected blood levels of other drugs, including antidepres- sants, antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, β-blockers, opioids, and antihistamines. Taking tryptophan while on an SSRI may result in a serotonergic syndrome of psychomotor agitation and GI distress. A potentially fatal interaction that clinically resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome may occur when SSRIs are administered concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Fluoxetine has the longest half-life of the SSRIs and should not be initiated within 14 days of the discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibi- tor, or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor initiated within at least 5 weeks of the discontinuation of fluoxetine.  CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 201 6. Dosage (Table 6–19)—Therapeutic response should be expected 4–6 weeks after a therapeutic dose has been reached. The starting dose for a child younger than 12 years old is generally half the starting dose for an adolescent. a. SSRIs—The SSRIs are usually given once a day, in the morning with breakfast. One in ten individuals may experience sedation and prefer to take the medication at bedtime. Fluoxe- tine is the only SSRI with FDA approval and replicable efficacy. b. Alternative antidepressants and fluvoxamine— The alternative antidepressants (see below) and fluvoxamine are usually given in twice-daily dosing. Paroxetine, bupro- pion, and venlafaxine are now available in a sustained- and extended-release form. 2. Other Antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin), bupropion SR (sustained-release), bupropion XL (extended-release) Duloxetine (Cymbalta) Mirtazapine (Remeron) Venlafaxine (Effexor), venlafaxine XR (extended-release) A. Bupropion 1. Indications—Bupropion is an antidepressant that inhib- its reuptake of primarily serotonin, but also norepinephrine and dopamine. It is approved for treatment of major depres- sion in adults, but is receiving favorable attention for its therapeutic effects in adolescents with major depressive disorder and in children and adolescents with ADHD. Like the SSRIs, bupropion has very few anticholinergic or car- diotoxic effects. 2. Contraindications—History of seizure disorder or bulimia nervosa. 3. Initial medical screening and follow-up—General med- ical examination. 4. Adverse effects—Psychomotor activation (agitation or restlessness), headache, GI distress, nausea, anorexia with weight loss, insomnia, tremulousness, precipitation of mania, and induction of seizures with doses above 450 mg/d. B. Venlafaxine Venlafaxine is an antidepressant that primarily inhibits reup- take of serotonin and norepinephrine. 1. Indications—It is approved for the treatment of major depression in adults. 2. Contraindications—Hypertension. 3. Initial medical screening and follow-up—General med- ical examination. Table 6–19. Medications used to treat depression in adolescents.

Adverse effects—The most common adverse effects are nausea, nervousness, and sweating. Hypertension is likely with doses over 300 mg or over 225 mg of the extended- release version. Venlafaxine must be discontinued slowly to minimize withdrawal symptoms: severe headaches, dizzi- ness, and significant flulike symptoms. It is also available in an extended-release form. C. Mirtazapine Mirtazapine is an α2-antagonist that enhances central nor- adrenergic and serotonergic activity. 1. Indications—It is approved for the treatment of major depression in adults. 2. Contraindications—Mirtazapine should not be given in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Very rare side effects are acute liver failure (1 case per 250,000– 300,000), neutropenia, and agranulocytosis. 3. Initial medical screening and follow-up—General med- ical examination. 4. Adverse effects—Dry mouth, increased appetite, consti- pation, weight gain. D. Duloxetine Duloxetine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reup- take inhibitor. 1. Indications—It is approved for the treatment of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. 2. Contraindications—Duloxetine should not be given in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Very rare side effects are orthostatic hypotension and liver toxicity. 3. Initial medical screening and follow-up—General med- ical examination. 4. Adverse effects—Nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, and fatigue. 3. Tricyclic Antidepressants Imipramine Desipramine Clomipramine Nortriptyline Amitriptyline With the introduction of the SSRIs and alternative antide- pressants, use of the TCAs has become uncommon for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. The TCAs have more significant side-effect profiles, require more substantial medical monitoring, and are quite cardiotoxic in overdose. For these reasons, in general, SSRIs or alternative antidepres- sants should be considered before recommending a TCA. In some countries, where access to newer and more costly medi- cations is difficult, TCAs are still frequently employed for certain behavioral, emotional, and functional conditions. 1. Indications—TCAs have been prescribed for chronic pain syndromes, migraines, headache, depression, anxiety, enure- sis, bulimia nervosa, OCD, and PTSD in children and adoles- cents. Imipramine and desipramine have FDA approval for the treatment of major depression in adults and for enuresis for children age 6 years and older. Some published studies have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of ADHD, panic disorder, anxiety-based school refusal, separa- tion anxiety disorder, bulimia, night terrors, and sleepwalk- ing. But as yet, the FDA has not approved their use for these indications. Studies have not supported efficacy in major depression in children and adolescents. Nortriptyline has FDA approval for the treatment of major depression in adults. Clomipramine has FDA approval for the treatment of depression and OCD in adults and may be helpful for obsessive symptoms in autism. 2. Contraindications—Known cardiac disease or arrhyth- mia, undiagnosed syncope, known seizure disorder, family history of sudden cardiac death or cardiomyopathy, known electrolyte abnormality (with bingeing and purging). 3. Initial medical screening—The family history should be examined for sudden cardiac death; the patient’s history for cardiac disease, arrhythmias, syncope, seizure disorder, or congenital hearing loss (associated with prolonged QT interval). Other screening procedures include serum electro- lytes and blood urea nitrogen in patients who have eating disorders, cardiac examination, and a baseline electrocardio- gram (ECG). 4. Medical follow-up—Measure pulse and blood pressure (monitor for tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension) with each dosage increase, and obtain an ECG to monitor for arteriovenous block with each dosage increase; after reaching steady state, record pulse, blood pressure, and ECG every 3– 4 months. 5. Adverse effects a. Cardiotoxic effects—The cardiotoxic effects of TCAs appear to be more common in children and adolescents than in adults. In addition to anticholinergic effects, TCAs have quinidine-like effects that result in slowing of cardiac conduc- tion. Increased plasma levels appear to be weakly associated with an increased risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities. Steady-state plasma levels of desipramine or of desipramine plus imipramine should therefore not exceed 300 ng/mL. In addition, for each dosage increase above 3 mg/kg/d, pulse and blood pressure must be carefully checked, and repeated ECGs obtained to monitor for arteriovenous block. Upper limits for cardiovascular parameters when administering TCAs to chil- dren and adolescents are listed in Table 6–20. "
225,Mood Stabilizers & Atypical Antipsychotics,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,1099,"MOOD STABILIZERS AND  ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS  Mood Stabilizers Carbamazepine (Tegretol), oxycarbamazepine (Trileptal) Gabapentin (Neurontin) Lamotrigine (Lamictal) Lithium carbonate (Eskalith, Eskalith CR, Lithobid, Lithotabs) Valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER)  Atypical Antipsychotics Aripiprazole (Abilify) Olanzapine (Zyprexa) Risperidone (Risperdal) Quetiapine (Seroquel) Ziprasidone (Geodon) Lithium and antiepileptic medications have historically been the drugs of choice for mood stabilization in bipolar mood disorder. New research also finds that the atypical antipsychotic medications are also effective. Lithium, valproic acid, olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone are FDA approved for the treatment of adult bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, although not FDA approved for treatment of bipolar disorder, may also be effec- tive and carry less risk of weight gain. Lamotrigine (Lamictal) was recently approved for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults. Other antiepileptic medications, such as gabapentin and topiramate, have also been used with varying efficacy. Medications that are effective as mood stabilizers may be helpful also in the treatment of severe aggressive symptoms. A. Lithium 1. Indications—Lithium remains a front-line drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder and has been shown to have an augmenting effect when combined with SSRIs for treatment- resistant depression and OCD. 2. Contraindications—Lithium is contraindicated in patients with known renal, thyroid, or cardiac disease; those at high risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (eg, vomiting and purging); and those who may become pregnant (terato- genic effects). 3. Initial medical screening—General medical screening with pulse, blood pressure, height, and weight; complete blood cell count (CBC); serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine; and thyroid function tests, includ- ing thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. 4. Dosage—For children the starting dose is usually 150 mg once or twice a day, with titration in 150- to 300-mg incre- ments. (Dose may vary with the brand of lithium used; consult a psychopharmacology textbook for medication-spe- cific information.) Oral doses of lithium should be titrated to maintain therapeutic blood levels of 0.8–1.2 mEq/L. The drug is generally given in two doses. Blood samples should be drawn 12 hours after the last dose. 5. Adverse effects a. Lithium toxicity—Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index. Blood levels required for therapeutic effects are close to those associated with toxic symptoms. Mild toxicity may be indicated by increased tremor, GI distress, neuromuscular irritability, and altered mental status (confusion), and can occur when blood levels exceed 1.5 mEq/L. Moderate to severe symptoms of lithium toxicity are associated with blood levels above 2 mEq/L. Acute renal failure can occur at levels over 2.5–3 mEq/L. b. Side effects—Lithium side effects include intention tremor, GI distress (including nausea and vomiting and some- times diarrhea), hypothyroidism, polyuria and polydipsia, drowsiness, malaise, weight gain, acne, and granulocytosis.

It may be used along with either valproate or carbamazepine in individuals with treatment-resistant disor- ders. The usual adult dose range for seizure disorders is 900– 1800 mg/d in three divided doses and may need to be adjusted downward in individuals with renal impairment. Although its use among adolescents and even children is increasing, gabapentin is not approved for this indication, and reports of its efficacy remain largely anecdotal. Some reports suggest it may worsen behavioral parameters in children with underlying ADHD. "
227,Antipsychotics,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,599,"ANTIPSYCHOTICS  Atypical Antipsychotics Aripiprazole (Abilify) Clozapine (Clozaril) Olanzapine (Zyprexa) Risperidone (Risperdal) Quetiapine (Seroquel) Ziprasidone (Geodon)  Conventional Neuroleptics Chlorpromazine Haloperidol Molindone Perphenazine Thioridazine Thiothixene Trifluoperazine The antipsychotics, formerly known as neuroleptics, are indicated for psychotic symptoms in patients with schizo- phrenia. Some now have an FDA-approved indication for bipolar affective disorder in adults (risperidone and olanza- pine). They are also used for acute mania and as adjuncts to antidepressants in the treatment of psychotic depression (with delusions or hallucinations). The antipsychotics may be used cautiously in refractory PTSD, in refractory OCD, and in individuals with markedly aggressive behavioral problems unresponsive to other interventions. They may also be useful for the body image distortion and irrational fears about food and weight gain associated with anorexia nervosa. The “atypical antipsychotics” differ from conventional antipsychotics in their receptor specificity and effect on serotonin receptors. Conventional antipsychotics are associ- ated with a higher incidence of movement disorders and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) due to their wider effect on dopamine receptors. The introduction of the atypical anti- psychotics has significantly changed neuroleptic prescribing patterns. The atypical antipsychotics have a better side-effect profile for most individuals and comparable efficacy for the treatment of psychotic symptoms and aggression. Atypical antipsychotics have a decreased incidence of EPS and tardive dyskinesia (TD). Significant side effects can include substan- tial weight gain and sedation. Because of their increased use over conventional antipsychotics, this section focuses pri- marily on the atypical antipsychotics. A. Aripiprazole Aripiprazole (Abilify) is the newest atypical neuroleptic and is indicated for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is a partial dopamine blocker and a serotonin agonist. Side effects include nausea and vomiting and fatigue. It is associated with minimal weight gain. Doses over 30 mg are more likely to be associated with EPS. The dose range is 5–30 mg, and pills can be split. B. Olanzapine The FDA has approved this agent for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) has greater affinity for type 2 serotonin receptors than dopamine-2 receptors and also has an effect on musca- rinic, histaminic, and α-adrenergic receptors. As with the other atypical antipsychotics, it may be more helpful for treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (flat affect, isolation and withdrawal, and apathy) than conventional antipsychotics. Anecdotal and case report data support its utility in child and adolescent psychotic disorders. The adult dose range of 5–15 mg/d administered in a single bedtime dose is probably applicable to adolescents as well. Weight gain can be a significant side effect. The starting dose for children is usually 1.25 mg. C. Quetiapine Quetiapine (Seroquel) is an antagonist at multiple receptor sites, including serotonin (5-HT1A and 5-HT2), dopamine (D1 and D2), histamine, and adrenergic receptors. Quetia- pine is given in 25- to 50-mg increments up to 800 mg for the treatment of psychotic symptoms. It is thought to be a weight-neutral medication, and the primary side effect is sedation. D. Risperidone Risperidone (Risperdal) blocks type 2 dopamine receptors (similarly to haloperidol) and type 2 serotonin receptors. It is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder in adults. Risperidone has also demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of Tourette syndrome. The initial dose is 1–2 mg/d. It is typically titrated up in 0.5–1 mg increments to a maximum dose of 4–10 mg for psychotic disorders. Side effects include weight gain and sedation. E. Ziprasidone Ziprasidone (Geodon) has affinity for multiple serotonin receptors (5-HT2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT2C) and dopa-   CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 207 f. Withdrawal dyskinesias—Withdrawal dyskinesias are reversible movement disorders that appear following with- drawal of neuroleptic medications. Dyskinetic movements develop within 1–4 weeks after withdrawal of the drug and may persist for months. g. Other adverse effects—These include cardiac arrhyth- mias, irregular menses, gynecomastia and galactorrhea due to increased prolactin, sexual dysfunction, photosensitivity, rashes, lowered seizure threshold, hepatic dysfunction, and blood dyscrasias. 3. Drug interactions—Potentiation of central nervous sys- tem depressant effects or the anticholinergic effects of other drugs may occur, as well as increased plasma levels of antidepressants. 4. Medical follow-up—The patient should be examined at least every 3 months for signs of the side effects listed. An Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale can be used to mon- itor for TD in patients taking antipsychotics. Most antipsy- chotic treatments seem to be associated with relevant weight gain, which increases the risk of the development of meta- bolic syndrome and future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. New recommendations include quarterly monitor- ing of blood pressure, weight gain, abdominal circumference, dietary and exercise habits, and, if indicated, fasting blood glucose and lipid panels. In cases of significant weight gain or abnormal laboratory values, patients should either be switched to an agent with a decreased risk for these adverse events or should receive additional treatments to reduce specific adverse events in cases in which discontinuation of the offending agent is clinically contraindicated or unfeasible. "
229,Adrenergic Agonists,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,1696,"ADRENERGIC AGONISTS Clonidine (Catapres) & Guanfacine (Tenex) 1. Indications—Clonidine is a nonselective α-adrenergic agonist that is clinically useful in decreasing states of hyper- arousal seen in children and adolescents with PTSD and ADHD. Guanfacine is a selective agonist for α2-adrenergic receptors with advantages over the nonselective agonist cloni- dine. Guanfacine is less sedating and less hypotensive than clonidine and has a longer half-life, allowing for twice-daily dosing. Case reports find guanfacine effective in ADHD and in Tourette syndrome with comorbid ADHD. Bedtime doses of adrenergic agonists can be helpful for the delayed onset of sleep and nightmares that can occur with PTSD, for the difficulty settling for sleep seen in ADHD, or for ameliorating the side effects of stimulant medications. These agents are also effective in the treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome 2. Contraindications—Adrenergic agonists are contraindi- cated in patients with known renal or cardiovascular disease and in those with a family or personal history of depression. 3. Initial medical screening—The pulse and blood pres- sure should be recorded prior to starting an adrenergic agonist. 4. Dosage—The initial dosage of clonidine is usually 0.025– 0.05 mg at bedtime. The dosage can be increased after 3–5 days by giving 0.05 mg in the morning. Further dosage increases are made by adding 0.05 mg first in the morning, then at noon, and then in the evening every 3–5 days to a maximum total daily dose of 0.3 mg in three or four divided doses per day. The half-life of clonidine is in the range of 3– 4 hours. Although a clinical response generally becomes apparent by about 4 weeks, treatment effects may increase over 2–3 months. Therapeutic doses of methylphenidate can frequently be decreased by 30–50% when used in conjunc- tion with clonidine. Transdermal administration of cloni- dine using a skin patch can be quite effective but may result in skin irritation in 40% of patients. Patches are generally changed every 5 days. The starting dosage of guanfacine is usually 0.5–1 mg once a day, increasing as clinically indicated after 3–5 days to 2–4 mg/d in two or three divided doses per day. Adverse effects include transient headaches and stomach aches in 25% of patients. Sedation and hypertension are mild. For medical follow-up, pulse and blood pressure should be checked every 1–2 weeks for 2 months and then at 3-month intervals. 5. Adverse effects—Sedation can be prominent. Side effects include fatigability, dizziness associated with hypotension, increased appetite and weight gain, headache, sleep distur- bance, GI distress, skin irritation with transdermal clonidine administration, and rebound hypertension with abrupt with- drawal. Bradycardia can occasionally be marked. 6. Drug interactions—Increased sedation with central ner- vous system depressants; possible increased anticholinergic toxicity. Several case reports have mentioned cardiac toxicity with clonidine when combined with methylphenidate, although other medications and clinical factors were present in each case. 7. Medical follow-up—Pulse and blood pressure should be recorded every 2 weeks for 2 months and then every 3 months. The discontinuation of clonidine or guanfacine should occur gradually, with stepwise dosage decreases every 3–5 days to avoid rebound hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored during withdrawal. Baumgartner JL et al: Citalopram in children and adolescents with depression or anxiety. Ann Pharmacother 2002;36:1692 [PMID: 12398561].

Krugman, MD Antonia Chiesa, MD The problem of child abuse and neglect, barely recognized as a significant problem in the early editions of this textbook, has grown to such serious proportions that in 1990 the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect called the present state of the nation’s ability to protect children a “national emergency.” Over a decade later and into the 21st century, the emergency is still with us. What Dr. Henry Kempe and his colleagues first called battered child syndrome was thought to affect 749 children in the United States in 1960. In 2005 an estimated 3.3 million referrals were made to child protective service agencies involving the alleged maltreatment of approximately 6 million children. This translates to an approximate national referral rate of 43.9 referrals per 1000 children. Just under 900,000 of these cases were substantiated by child protective services in 2005, yielding an abuse victim- ization rate of 12.1 per 1000 American children. At least 1500 children are victims of fatal child abuse each year, and in 2005 the rate of child abuse death was 1.96 per 100,000 children. This dramatic increase in cases has resulted from increased recognition of the problem by professionals, partly in response to statutory reporting mandates, a broadening of the definitions of abuse and neglect from the original battered child concept, and changes in the demography and social structure of families and neighborhoods over the past several decades. Sub- stance abuse, poverty and economic strains, parental capacity and skills, and domestic violence are cited as the most common presenting problems in abusive families. Abuse and neglect of children are best considered in an ecological perspective, which recognizes the individual, fam- ily, social, and psychological influences that come together to contribute to the problem. Kempe and Helfer termed this the abusive pattern, in which the child, the crisis, and the caregiver’s potential to abuse are components in the event of maltreatment. For most pediatric health care professionals, however, their involvement will be limited to individual cases. This chapter focuses on the knowledge necessary for the recognition, intervention, and follow-up of the more common "
231,Forms of Child Maltreatment,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,2332,"forms of child maltreatment and highlights the role of pediatric professionals in prevention. FORMS OF CHILD MALTREATMENT Child maltreatment may occur either within or outside the family. The proportion of intrafamilial to extrafamilial cases varies with the type of abuse as well as the gender and age of the child. Each of the following conditions may exist as separate or concurrent diagnoses. Neglect is the most com- monly reported and substantiated form of child maltreat- ment annually. Physical Abuse Physical abuse of children is most often inflicted by a caregiver or family member but occasionally by a stranger. The most common manifestations include bruises, burns, fractures, head trauma, and abdominal injuries. A small but significant number of unexpected pediatric deaths, particu- larly in infants and very young children (eg, sudden unex- pected infant death), are related to physical abuse. Sexual Abuse Sexual abuse is defined as the engaging of dependent, devel- opmentally immature children in sexual activities that they do not fully comprehend and to which they cannot give consent, or activities that violate the laws and taboos of a society. It includes all forms of incest, sexual assault or rape, and pedophilia. This includes fondling, oral-genital-anal contact, all forms of intercourse or penetration, exhibition- ism, voyeurism, exploitation or prostitution, and the involvement of children in the production of pornography. Although over the past decade there has been a small downward trend in total reports of sexual abuse cases, exploitation and enticement of children and adolescents via the Internet remains a growing trend.

The most common form is verbal abuse or denigration. Children who witness domestic violence should be considered emotionally abused. The most common feature of emotional neglect is the absence of normal parent-child attachment and a subsequent inability to recognize and respond to an infant’s or child’s needs. A common manifestation of emotional neglect in infancy is nutritional (nonorganic) failure to thrive. Physical Neglect Physical neglect is the failure to provide the necessary food, clothing, and shelter and a safe environment in which children can grow and develop. Although often associated with poverty or ignorance, physical neglect involves a more serious problem than just lack of resources. There is often a component of emotional neglect and either a failure or an inability, intentionally or otherwise, to recognize and respond to the needs of the child. Medical Care Neglect Medical care neglect is failure to provide the needed treat- ment to infants or children with life-threatening illness or other serious or chronic medical conditions. Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy Münchausen syndrome by proxy is a relatively unusual disor- der in which a caregiver, usually the mother, either simulates or creates the symptoms or signs of illness in a child. The disorder has recently been termed factitious disorder by proxy. The child can present with a long list of medical problems or often bizarre, recurrent complaints. Persistent doctor shop- ping and enforced invalidism (eg, not accepting that the child is healthy and reinforcing that the child is somehow ill) are also described in the original definition of Münchausen syndrome by proxy. Fatal cases have been reported. "
232,Recognition of Abuse & Neglect,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,1928,"RECOGNITION OF ABUSE & NEGLECT The most common features suggesting a diagnosis of child abuse are summarized in Tables 7–1 and 7–2. Obvious signs of injury, sexual abuse, or neglect may be present. Classic radiographic and laboratory findings are discussed later in this chapter. Psychosocial factors may indicate risk for or confirm child maltreatment. Recognition of any form of abuse and neglect of children can occur only if child abuse is considered in the differential diagno- sis of the child’s presenting medical condition. The approach to the family should be supportive, nonaccusatory, and empa- thetic. The individual who brings the child in for care may not have any involvement in the abuse. Approximately one third of child abuse incidents occur in extrafamilial settings. Neverthe- less, the assumption that the caregiver is “nice,” combined with the failure to consider the possibility of abuse, can be costly and even fatal. Raising the possibility that a child has been abused is not the same as accusing the caregiver of being the abuser. The health professional who is examining the child can explain to the family that several possibilities might explain the child’s injuries or abuse-related symptoms. If the family or presenting caregiver is not involved in the child’s maltreatment, they may actually welcome the necessary report and investigation. History In all cases of abuse and neglect, a detailed psychosocial history is important. This should include information on who lives in the home, other caregivers, domestic violence, sub- stance abuse, and prior family history of physical or sexual abuse. Inquiring about any previous involvement with social services or law enforcement can help to determine risk. Table 7–1. Common historical features in child abuse cases. Discrepant, evolving, or absent history Delay in seeking care Event or behavior by child that triggers a loss of control of caregiver History of abuse in the caregiver’s childhood Inappropriate affect of the caregiver Pattern of increasing severity or number of injuries if no intervention Social or physical isolation of the child or the caregiver Stress or crisis in the family or the caregiver Unrealistic expectations of caregiver for the child Table 7–2. Presentations of sexual abuse. General or direct statements about sexual abuse Sexualized knowledge, play, or behavior in developmentally imma- ture children Sexual abuse of other children by the victim Behavioral changes Sleep disturbances (eg, nightmares and night terrors) Appetite disturbances (eg, anorexia, bulimia) Depression, social withdrawal, anxiety Aggression, temper tantrums, impulsiveness Neurotic or conduct disorders, phobias or avoidant behaviors Guilt, low self-esteem, mistrust, feelings of helplessness Hysterical or conversion reactions Suicidal, runaway threats or behavior Excessive masturbation Medical conditions Recurrent abdominal pain or frequent somatic complaints Genital, anal, or urethral trauma Recurrent complaints of genital or anal pain, discharge, bleeding Enuresis or encopresis Sexually transmitted infections Pregnancy Promiscuity or prostitution, sexual dysfunction, fear of intimacy School problems or truancy Substance abuse   CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT 213 produced or simulated. They may be actually ill or, more often, are reported to be ill and have a normal clinical appearance. Among the most common reported presentations are recur- rent apnea, dehydration from induced vomiting or diarrhea, sepsis when contaminants are injected into a child, change in mental status, fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, and seizures. Radiologic & Laboratory Findings A. Physical Abuse  Certain radiologic findings are strong indicators of physical abuse. Examples are metaphyseal “corner” or “bucket han- dle” fractures of the long bones in infants, spiral fracture of the extremities in nonambulatory infants, rib fractures, spi- nous process fractures, and fractures in multiple stages of healing. Skeletal surveys in children aged 3 years or younger should be performed when a suspicious fracture is diag- nosed. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imag- ing findings of subdural hemorrhage in infants—in the absence of a clear accidental history—are highly correlated with abusive head trauma, especially after the advent of infant seat restraint laws that have reduced the incidence of head trauma in infants. Abdominal computed tomography is the preferred test in suspected abdominal trauma. Any infant or very young child with suspected abuse-related head or abdominal trauma should be evaluated immediately by an emergency physician or trauma surgeon. Coagulation studies and a complete blood cell count with platelets are useful in children who present with multiple or severe bruising in different stages of healing. Coagulopathy conditions may confuse the diagnostic picture but can be excluded with a careful history, examination, laboratory screens, and hematologic consultation if necessary. The differential diagnosis of all forms of physical abuse can be considered in the context of a detailed trauma history, family medical history, radiographic findings, and laboratory testing. The diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta or other collagen disorders, for example, may be considered in the child with skin and joint findings or multiple fractures with or without the classic radiographic presentation and is best made in consultation with a geneticist, an orthopedic sur- geon, and a radiologist. Trauma—accidental or inflicted— leads the differential diagnosis list for subdural hematomas. Coagulopathy; disorders of copper, amino acid, or organic acid metabolism (eg, Menkes syndrome and glutaric acide- mia type 1); chronic or previous central nervous system infection; birth trauma; or congenital central nervous system malformation (eg, arteriovenous malformations or cere- brospinal fluid collections) may need to be ruled out in some cases. It should be recognized, however, that children with these rare disorders can also be victims of abuse or neglect. B. Sexual Abuse The forensic evaluation of sexually abused children should be performed in a setting that prevents further emotional distress. If the history indicates that the child may have had contact with the ejaculate of a perpetrator within 72 hours, an examination to look for semen or its markers (eg, acid phosphatase) should be performed according to established protocols. This should occur in an emergency department or clinic where chain of custody for specimens can be assured. More important, if there is a history of possible sexual abuse within the past 48–72 hours, and the child reports a physical complaint or a sign is observed (eg, genital or anal bleeding or discharge), the child should be examined for signs of trauma. The most experienced examiner (pediatrician, nurse examiner, or child advocacy center) is preferable. The labo- ratory and serologic evaluation of STIs should be guided by the type of contact reported and the epidemiology of these infections in the community. C. Neglect and Growth Failure Children with failure to thrive or malnutrition may not require an extensive workup. Assessment of the patient’s growth curve, as well as careful plotting of subsequent growth parameters after treatment, is critical. Complete blood cell count, urinalysis, electrolyte panel, and thyroid and liver function tests are sufficient screening. Newborn screening should be documented as usual. Other tests should be guided by any aspect of the clinical history that points to a previously undiagnosed condition. A skeletal survey and head computed tomography scan may be helpful if concur- rent physical abuse is suspected. The best screening method, however, is placement in a setting in which the child can be fed and monitored. Hospital or foster care placement may be required. Weight gain may not occur for several days to a week in severe cases. D. Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy Recurrent polymicrobial sepsis (especially in children with indwelling catheters), recurrent apnea, chronic dehydration of unknown cause, or other highly unusual unexplained laboratory findings should raise the suspicion of Mün- chausen syndrome by proxy. "
235,Management & Reporting,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,5012,"MANAGEMENT & REPORTING Physical abuse injuries, STIs, and medical sequelae of neglect should be treated immediately. Children with failure to thrive related to emotional and physical neglect need to be placed in a setting in which they can be fed and cared for. Likewise, the child in danger of recurrent abuse or neglect needs to be placed in a safe environment. In the United States, clinicians and many other profes- sionals who come in contact with or care for children are mandated reporters. If abuse or neglect is suspected, a report must be made to the local or state agency designated to investigate such matters. In most cases, this will be the child protective services agency. Law enforcement agencies may   CHAPTER 7 214 also receive such reports. The purpose of the report is to permit professionals to gather the information needed to determine whether the child’s environment (eg, home, school, day care setting, or foster home) is safe. Recent backlash against physicians in Great Britain involved in high-profile child abuse cases should not deter anyone in the United States from following the state-specific child abuse reporting laws. Many hospitals and communities make child protection teams or consultants available when there are questions about the diagnosis and management in a child abuse case. A listing of pediatric consultants in child abuse is available from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Except in extreme cases, the reporting of emotional abuse is not likely to generate an immediate response from child protection agencies. This should not deter reporting, espe- cially if there is also concern for domestic violence or other forms of abuse or neglect. Practitioners can encourage par- ents to become involved with parent effectiveness training programs (eg, Healthy Families America or Parents Anony- mous) or to seek mental health consultation. Support for the child may also include mental health counseling or age- appropriate peer and mentoring activities in school or the community. Finally, communication with social services, case management, and careful follow-up by primary care providers is crucial to ensuring ongoing safety of child. "
236,Prevention,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,1470,"PREVENTION Physical abuse is preventable in many cases. Extensive expe- rience with and evaluation of high-risk families have shown that the provision of home visitor services to families at risk can prevent abuse and neglect of children. These services can be provided by public health nurses or trained paraprofes- sionals, although more data are available describing public health nurse intervention. The availability of these services could make it as easy for a family to pick up the telephone and ask for help before they abuse a child as it is for a neighbor or physician to report an episode of abuse after it has occurred. Parent education and anticipatory guidance are also helpful, with attention to handling situations that stress parents (eg, colic, crying behavior, and toilet training), age-appropriate discipline, and general developmental issues. Prevention of abusive injuries perpetrated by nonparent caregivers (eg, babysitters, nannies, and unrelated adults in the home) may be addressed by education and counseling of mothers about safe child care arrangements and advocating for affordable day care for all families. Promising new data suggest the efficacy of hospital-based programs that teach parents about the dangers of shaking an infant and how to respond to a crying infant. The prevention of sexual abuse is more difficult. Most efforts in this area involve teaching children to protect themselves and their “private parts” from harm or interfer- ence. The age of toilet training is a good time to provide anticipatory guidance to encourage parents to consider this discussion. The most rational approach is to place the burden of responsibility of prevention on the adults who supervise the child and the medical providers rather than on the children themselves. Knowing the parents’ own history of any victimization is important, as the ability to engage in this anticipatory guidance discussion with a provider and their child may be affected by that history. Promoting Internet safety and limiting exposure to sexual- ized materials and media should be part of this anticipatory guidance. Finally, many resource books on this topic for parents can be found in the parenting and health sections of most bookstores. Efforts to prevent emotional abuse of children have been undertaken through extensive media campaigns. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of this approach. The primary care physician can promote positive, nurturing, and nonviolent behavior in parents. The message that they are role models for a child’s behavior is important. Screening for domestic violence during anticipatory guidance discussions on discipline, home, and safety can be effective in identifying parents and children at risk.

In this chapter, special attention is given to the "
238,Pediatric History,Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders  & Psychosocial Aspects of Pediatrics ,356,"pediatric history and physical examination, normal developmental stages, office telephone management, and community pediatrics. The development of a physician–patient–parent relation- ship is crucially important if the patient and parent are to effectively confide their concerns. This relationship develops over time, with increasing numbers of visits, and is facilitated by the continuity of clinicians and other staff members. This clinical relationship is based on trust that develops as a result of several experiences in the context of the office visit. Perhaps the greatest factor facilitating the relationship is for patients or parents to experience advice as valid and effective. Important skills include choosing vocabulary that communi- cates understanding and competence, demonstrating com- mitment of time and attention to the concern, and showing respect for areas that the patient or parent does not wish to address (assuming there are no concerns relating to physical or sexual abuse or neglect). Parents and patients expect that their concerns will be managed confidentially and that the clinician understands and sympathizes with those concerns. The effective physician–patient–parent relationship is one of the most satisfying aspects of ambulatory pediatrics. PEDIATRIC HISTORY A unique feature of pediatrics is that the history represents an amalgam of parents’ objective reporting of facts (eg, fever for 4 days), parents’ subjective interpretation of their child’s symptoms (eg, infant crying interpreted by parents as abdom- inal pain), and for older children their own history of events. Parents and patients may provide a specific and detailed history, or a vague history that necessitates more focused probing. Parents may or may not be able to distinguish whether symptoms are caused by organic illness or a psycho- logical concern. It is often helpful to ask what problems the parents specifically wish to address in order to determine what really prompted the office visit. Some visits are occasioned by problems at school, such as low grades or troublesome peer relationships. Understanding the family and its hopes for and concerns about the child can help in the process of distin- guishing organic illness from emotional or behavioral condi- tions, thus minimizing unnecessary testing and intervention. Although the parents’ concerns need to be understood, it is essential also to obtain as much of the history as possible directly from the patient. Direct histories not only provide firsthand information but also give the child a degree of control over a potentially threatening situation and may reveal important information about the family. Obtaining a comprehensive pediatric history is time- consuming. Many offices provide questionnaires for parents to complete before the clinician sees the child. Data from questionnaires can make an outpatient visit more produc- tive, allowing the physician to address problems in detail while more quickly reviewing areas that are not of concern. Questionnaires may be more productive than face-to-face interviews in revealing sensitive parts of the history. How- ever, failure to review and assimilate this information prior to the interview may cause a parent or patient to feel that the time and effort have been wasted. Elements of the history that will be useful over time should be readily accessible in the medical record. Such information can be accumulated on a summary sheet, as illustrated in Figure 8–1. Demographic data; a problem list; information about chronic medications, allergies, and previous hospitaliza- tions; and the names of other physicians providing care for the patient are commonly included. Documentation of immuni- zations, including all data required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, should be kept on a second page. The components of a comprehensive pediatric history are listed in Table 8–1. The information should, ideally, be obtained at the first office visit. The first seven items may be included on a summary sheet at the front of the medical  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

The entire list should be reviewed and augmented with relevant updates at each health supervision visit. "
239,Pediatric Physical Examination,Child Abuse & Neglect ,253,"PEDIATRIC PHYSICAL EXAMINATION During the pediatric physical examination, time must be taken to allow the patient to become familiar with the examiner. Interactions and instructions help the child under- stand what is occurring and what is expected. A gentle, friendly manner and a quiet voice help establish a setting that yields a nonthreatening physical examination. The examiner should take into consideration the need for a quiet child, the extent of trust established, and the possibility of an emotional response (crying!) when deciding the order in which the child’s organ systems are examined. Painful or unpleasant procedures (eg, otoscopic examinations) should be deferred until the end of the examination. Whether or not the physi- cian can establish rapport with the child, the process should proceed efficiently and systematically. ▲ Figure 8–1. Use of a summary sheet such as this at the front of the record facilitates reorienting the caregiver and his  or her partners to the patient. Some practices keep track of health supervision visits on this sheet to tell the physician  whether the child is likely to have received the appropriate preventive services. A second page documenting immunizations  should record data required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. When an allergy with potential for anaphylaxis is  identified, the patient should wear a medical alert bracelet and obtain an epinephrine kit, if appropriate.

241,Health Supervision Visits,Child Abuse & Neglect ,40,"HEALTH SUPERVISION VISITS One of several timetables for recommended health supervision visits is illustrated in Figure 8–2. (Note: A PDF printable format of this figure is available from the American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP].) The federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau has developed comprehensive health supervision guidelines through their Bright Futures program. In areas where evidence-based information is lacking, expert opinion has been used as the basis for these plans. For example, immunizations are proven to be effective and necessary (Cen- ters for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]), whereas there is disagreement about whether screening for certain metabolic diseases is universally warranted. Practitioners should remem- ber that guidelines are not meant to be rigid; services should be individualized according to the child’s needs. During health supervision visits, the practitioner should review child development and acute and chronic problems, conduct a complete physical examination, order appropriate screening tests, and anticipate future developments. New historical information should be elicited through an interval history. Development should be assessed by parental report and clinician observation at each visit. Developmental sur- veillance is augmented with systematic use of parent- directed questionnaires or screening tests. Growth is care- fully recorded, and the growth chart is brought up to date (see Chapter 2). Vision and hearing should be assessed subjectively at each visit, with objective assessments at inter- vals beginning after the child is old enough to cooperate with the screening test, usually at age 3 or 4 years. Various laboratory screening tests may also be part of the visit. Because fewer than 4% of asymptomatic children have physical findings on routine health maintenance visits, a major portion of the health supervision visit is devoted to anticipatory guidance. This portion of the visit enables the health care provider to address behavioral, developmental, injury prevention, and nutritional issues; school problems; and other age-appropriate issues that will arise before the next well-child visit.

DEVELOPMENTAL & BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT Addressing developmental and behavioral problems is one of the central features of pediatric primary care. The term developmental delay refers to the circumstance in which a child has not demonstrated a developmental skill (such as walking independently) by an age at which the vast majority of normally developing children have accomplished this task. Developmental delays are, in fact, quite common: approximately 18% of children younger than age 18 years either have developmental delays or have conditions that place them at risk of developmental delays. Pediatric practitioners are in a unique position to assess the development of their patients. This developmental assessment should ideally take the form of developmental surveillance, in which a skilled individual monitors development over time as part of providing routine care. Developmental surveillance includes several key elements: listening to parent concerns; obtaining a developmental history; making careful observa- tions during office visits; periodically screening all infants and children for delays using validated screening tools; recognizing conditions and circumstances that place children at increased risk of delays; and referring children who fail screening tests for further evaluation and intervention. The prompt recognition of children with developmental delays is important for several reasons. The presence of delays may lead practitioners to diagnose unsuspected but important conditions, such as genetic syndromes or meta- bolic disorders. Children with delays can be referred for a wide range of developmental therapies, such as those pro- vided by physical therapists and speech/language therapists. Importantly, children with delays, regardless of the cause, make better developmental progress if they receive appropri- ate developmental therapies than if they do not. Finally, many infants and toddlers younger than age 3 years with developmental delays are eligible to receive a range of thera- pies and other services, often provided in the home, at no cost to families. Children aged 3 years and older with delays are also eligible for developmental services, at no cost, through the local school system. Although the benefits of early detection of developmental delays are clear, it is often difficult to incorporate develop- mental surveillance into busy outpatient practice. Only 30% of pediatricians routinely use formal screening tests; most rely on clinical judgment alone. However, when screening tests are not used, delays are often not detected until school age, particularly when the delays are not severe. There are several practical barriers to performing routine surveillance using standardized screening tools: perceived lack of time to screen all children at every well child visit; lack of familiarity with the various screening tools; not wanting to concern parents by identifying a possible delay; and not knowing where in the community to refer patients with suspected delays. There are some solutions to these barriers, such as using parent develop- mental questionnaires rather than provider-administered tests to save time, become familiar with one or two screening tests, and making use of Internet-based resources. For exam- ple, the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities maintains a web site with links to a wide variety of resources in each state (http://www.nichcy.org). Several parent-administered and physician-administered developmental screening tools are available. The Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status, the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, and the Child Development Inventories are    AMBULATORY & COMMUNITY PEDIATRICS 229 IMMUNIZATIONS A child’s immunization status should be assessed at every clinic visit and every opportunity should be taken to vacci- nate. Even though parents may keep an immunization record, it is critical that providers also keep an accurate record of a child’s immunizations. This information should be written in a prominent location in the paper or electronic chart or kept in an immunization registry. Despite high overall national immunization coverage levels, areas of underimmunization continue to exist in the United States. An understanding of true contraindications (versus “false contraindications”) and a “no missed opportu- nities” approach to immunization delivery has been shown to successfully increase immunization levels. Therefore, it is important that clinicians screen records and administer required immunizations at all types of visits, and administer all needed vaccinations simultaneously. Additionally, clini- cians should operate reminder/recall systems, in which par- ents of underimmunized children are prompted by mail or telephone to visit the clinic for immunization. The assess- ment of clinic-wide immunization levels and feedback of these data to providers have also been shown to increase immunization rates. Immunization schedules and other details of specific vaccines are presented in Chapter 9. A wealth of information for parents and providers about immunizations is also avail- able at the National Immunization Program’s web site (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines).

251,Other Types of General Pediatric Services,Child Abuse & Neglect ,1868,"OTHER TYPES OF GENERAL  PEDIATRIC SERVICES ACUTE-CARE VISITS Acute-care visits account for 30% or more of the general pediatrician’s office visits. These visits are conducted in an efficient, structured way. Office personnel should determine the reason for the visit and whether it is an emergent situation, obtain a brief synopsis of the child’s symptoms, carefully document vital signs, and list known drug allergies. The pediatric clinician should document the events related to the presenting problem and carefully describe them in the medical record. The record should include supporting labo- ratory data and a diagnosis. Treatments and follow-up instructions must be recorded, including when to return to the office if the problem is not ameliorated. Immunization status should be screened, as previously discussed. Depend- ing on the severity of illness, this may also be an opportunity for age-appropriate health maintenance screenings and anticipatory guidance. This may be particularly true with older school-aged children or adolescents who may be seen more rarely for routine health maintenance visits. PRENATAL VISITS Ideally, a couple’s first trip to a physician’s office should take place before the birth of their baby. A prenatal visit goes a long way toward establishing trust and enables a pediatric provider to learn about a family’s expectations, concerns, and fears regarding the anticipated birth. If the infant devel- ops a problem during the newborn period, a provider who has already met the family is in a better position to maintain rapport and communication with the new parents. In addition to helping establish a relationship between parents and pediatric providers, the prenatal visit can be used to gather information about the parents and the preg- nancy, provide information and advice, and identify high- risk situations. A range of information can be provided to parents regarding feeding choices and the benefits of breast feeding; injury prevention, including sleeping position and the appropriate use of car seats; and techniques for managing colic. Potential high-risk situations that may be identified include mental health issues in the parents, a history of domestic violence, or maternal medical problems that may affect the infant. Serwint JR: The prenatal pediatric visit. Pediatr Rev 2003;24:31 [PMID: 12509543]. SPORTS PHYSICALS The purpose of the preparticipation health evaluation is to determine whether a child can safely participate in organized sports activity. Attention should be directed toward those parts of the body that are most vulnerable to the stresses of sports. The history and physical examination should focus on the following systems: cardiovascular (stenotic lesions, hyper- tension, surgery), respiratory (asthma), vision, genitourinary (absence or loss of function of one testicle), gastrointestinal (hepatosplenomegaly, hernia), skin (infection), musculoskele- tal (inflammation, dysfunction), and neurologic (concussions, uncontrolled seizures). The sports physical should include counseling about medication usage, protective equipment, proper supervision and instruction, injury management, and the emotional aspects of competition and teamwork. Informa- tion about certain sports should be included. For example, protective eyewear, mouth guards, padded goalposts, and efforts to minimize heading the ball should be discussed with a soccer player and his or her parent. The physician should suggest sports that will be compatible with the child’s size, strength, endurance, agility, and history of chronic illness. The potential for mild menstrual irregularities should be explained to the adolescent female athlete. The athlete with moderate to    CHAPTER 8 232 versus car), seen in the office later (today versus tomorrow), or whether the illness can be safely cared for at home. At the end of the call, it should be confirmed that parents understand and feel comfortable with the plan for their child. The use of the World Wide Web (Internet) has become common in the pediatric office setting. Many practices routinely use the Internet to give information about the practice, the care of common minor problems, scheduling of appointments, insurance issues, and so on. With time, the Internet is sure to become a larger part of the ambulatory pediatric practice. Bunik M et al: Pediatric telephone call centers—how do they affect health care utilization and costs?

COMMUNITY PEDIATRICS According to the AAP, community pediatrics is “a perspec- tive that enlarges the pediatrician’s focus from one child to all children in the community.” Pediatricians have histori- cally been very involved in supporting and developing ser- vices for vulnerable children in their communities. As a group, pediatricians recognize that communities are integral determinants of a child’s health and that the synthesis of public health and personal health principles and practices is important in the practice of community pediatrics. As well, pediatricians have long been committed to working with other professionals in the community and advocating for the needs of all children. For example, pediatricians have been instrumental in the passage of laws requiring protective fencing around swimming pools. Pediatricians in practice are frequently instrumental in referring children and families to valuable services and resources. For example, uninsured children can be enrolled in either their state Medicaid program or State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Children with special health care needs may be eligible for services typically funded through state health departments and through programs such as those provided based on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). A variety of community-based immu- nization programs can provide access to needed immuniza- tions for eligible children. Food and nutrition programs such as the federally funded Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program provide sources of food at no cost to eligible fami- lies. Finally, subsidized preschool and child care services such as the federally funded Head Start program provide needed preschool programs. Pediatricians are in a unique position to make referrals to these important services. American Academy of Pediatrics: The pediatrician’s role in com- munity pediatrics.

254,Common General Pediatric Issues,Child Abuse & Neglect ,3652,"COMMON GENERAL PEDIATRIC ISSUES FEVER  General Considerations Fever is one of the most common reasons for pediatric office visits, emergency department encounters, and after- hours telephone calls. Several different definitions of fever exist, but most experts define fever as a rectal temperature of 38°C or above. Temperature in pediatric patients can be measured in a variety of manners: rectal (using a mercury or digital thermometer), oral (mercury or digital), axillary (mercury, digital, or liquid crystal strip), forehead (liquid crystal strip), or tympanic (using a device that measures thermal infrared energy from the tympanic membrane). Tympanic measurement of temperature is quick and requires little patient cooperation. Several cautions apply to the use of this technique: tympanic temperatures have been shown to be less accurate in infants younger than 3 months of age and are subject to false readings if the instrument is not positioned properly or the external ear canal is occluded by wax.  Causes Fever occurs when there is a rise in the hypothalamic set- point in response to endogenously produced pyrogens. Among the broad range of conditions that cause fever are infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, chronic inflammatory conditions, medications (including immunizations), central nervous system abnor- malities, and exposure to excessive environmental heat. In most settings, the majority of fevers in pediatric patients are caused by self-limiting viral infections. Teething does not cause fever over 38.4°C.  Clinical Findings A. Initial Evaluation When evaluating a child with fever, one should elicit from the parents information about the duration of fever, how the temperature was taken, the maximum height of fever docu-    236 9 Immunization Matthew F.

In 2006, the immunization rate for  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Additionally, data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project shows that only 36% of children younger than age 2 years were completely compliant with vaccination recom- mendations: 30% had a missed opportunity for immuniza- tion; 20% had an invalid immunization; and 12% received unnecessary immunization (costing an estimated $26.5 mil- lion). The AAP recommends the following specific proven practices to improve these defects: (1) sending caretakers reminder and recall notices, (2) using prompts during all visits, (3) periodic measurement of immunization rates, and (4) having standing orders for vaccines. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires that for each vaccine covered under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, caretakers should be advised about the risks and benefits of vaccination in a standard manner, using Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) pro- duced by the CDC. Each time a Vaccine Injury Compensa- tion Program–covered vaccine is administered, the current version of the VIS must be provided to the nonminor patient or legal caretaker. Documentation is required in the medical record, including the vaccine manufacturer, lot number, and date of administration and expiration. The name and address of the person administering the vaccine, VIS version and date, and site and route of administration should also be recorded. Needles used for vaccination should be sterile and dispos- able to minimize the opportunity for contamination. A 70% solution of alcohol is appropriate for disinfection of the stopper of the vaccine container and of the skin at the injection site. A 5% topical emulsion of lidocaine-prilocaine applied to the site of vaccination for 30–60 minutes prior to the injection minimizes the pain, especially when multiple vaccines are administered. Compliance with the manufacturer’s recommendations for route and site of administration of injectable vaccines are critical for safety and efficacy. All vaccines containing an adjuvant must be administered intramuscularly to avoid granuloma formation or necrosis. With the exception of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is used rarely in the United States, all vaccines are given either intramuscu- larly or subcutaneously. Intramuscular injections are given at a 90-degree angle to the skin, using a needle that is sufficiently long to reach the muscle tissue, but not so long as to injure underlying nerves, blood vessels, or bones. The anterolateral thigh is the preferred site of vaccination in newborns and children up to 2 years of age, and the deltoid muscle of the arm is the preferred site for children aged 3–18 years. Needle length and location should be as follows: 5/8 inch in newborn infants in the thigh; 1 inch in infants 1–12 months old (thigh), 1 inch to 11/4 inches in 1–18 year olds (thigh), and 5/8 inch to 1 inch in 1–18 year olds (deltoid). Subcutaneous injections should be administered at a 45-degree angle into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (for infants younger than 12 months) or the upper outer triceps area (for children 12 months and older) using a 23- or 25-gauge 5/8-inch needle. Pulling back on the syringe prior to vaccine injection (aspira- tion) is not required in CDC recommendations. A separate syringe and needle should be used for each vaccine.

260,Routine Childhood & Adolescent  Immunizations,Ambulatory & Community Pediatrics ,2488,"ROUTINE CHILDHOOD & ADOLESCENT IMMUNIZATIONS Each year, the CDC issues recommended immunization schedules for children and adolescents. While variation from these schedules may be necessitated by epidemiologic or indi- vidual clinical circumstances, these schedules serve as an important guide for vaccination providers. In the schedules, vaccines are roughly ordered by the age at which the vaccines are first given. For example, HepB is given to newborn infants at birth, followed by rotavirus, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), Hib, pneumococcal conjugate 7-valent (PCV7) and inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccines beginning at 2 months of age. Table 9–1 sets forth a schedule of routine immunizations for normal infants and children from birth to 6 years. Table 9–2 presents a schedule of routine immunization for persons aged 7–18 years. Table 9–3 presents recommended  schedules for children who did not start vaccination at the recommended time during the first year of life. Combination vaccines help solve the problem of large numbers of injections during any single clinic visit. Currently available combination vaccines include MMR, measles- mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV), and various combinations of Hib, HepB, IPV, and DTaP, including a DTaP-HepB-IPV combination vaccine. Additional combination vaccines, including some vaccines specifically for older children and adolescents, are in development. Separate vaccines should not be combined into one syringe by the provider unless approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), because this could decrease the efficacy of each component vaccine. SAFE HANDLING OF VACCINES The numerous vaccines and other immunologic substances used by the practitioner vary in the storage temperatures required. The majority of vaccines should never be subjected to freezing temperatures. Vaccines that require routine freez- ing are MMRV, VAR, and herpes zoster vaccines. Yellow fever vaccine may also be stored frozen. Product package inserts should be consulted for detailed information on vaccine storage conditions and shelf life.

SAFETY OF IMMUNIZATION Although no vaccine is 100% safe and effective, after decades of experience and many millions of doses administered, vac- cines have proven to be among the safest of medical interven- tions. However, as diseases such as measles and polio become exceedingly rare in the United States, the apparent risks of vaccination have taken a more prominent role in the public discourse. When vaccine-preventable diseases are perceived to be treatable or rare, the risks of vaccination may appear to outweigh the benefits, particularly to persons who misunder- stand the actual risks from vaccines and the potential for resurgence of some diseases when the public is not adequately immunized. Decisions about vaccination, both at the individ- ual and societal level, need to be made based on accurate and timely information. Parents with questions about vaccine safety should be directed to trusted web sites, such as those of the AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians    CHAPTER 9 238 Many combinations of vaccines can be administered simultaneously without increasing the risk of adverse effects or compromising response. Inactivated vaccines (with the exception of cholera and yellow fever) can be given simulta- neously with, or at any time after, a different vaccine. Injectable or nasally given live-virus vaccines, if not admin- istered on the same day, should be given at least 4 weeks apart (eg, measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] and varicella [VAR]). Lapses in the immunization schedule do not call for reinstitution of the series. Extra doses of hepatitis B (HepB), Hib, MMR, and VAR are not harmful, but repetitive expo- sure to tetanus vaccine beyond the recommended intervals can result in hypersensitivity reactions and should be avoided. If an immunoglobulin (Ig) or blood product has been administered, live-virus vaccination should be delayed 3–11 months, depending on the product, to avoid interfer- ence with the immune response (eg, 3 months for tetanus Ig, hepatitis A Ig, and hepatitis B Ig; 5–6 months for measles Ig or cytomegalovirus Ig; and 11 months for intravenous Ig for Kawasaki disease). With the large number of vaccine preparations available, interchangeability of vaccines is an issue. All brands of Hib conjugate, HepB, and hepatitis A (HepA) vaccines are inter- changeable. For vaccines containing acellular pertussis anti- gens, it is recommended that the same brand be used, but when the brand is unknown or the same brand is unavail- able, any vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis should be used to continue vaccination. A longer than recommended interval between vaccinations does not reduce final antibody titers, and lapsed schedules do not require restarting the series. Vaccines very rarely cause acute anaphylactic-type reac- tions. Nonetheless, all vaccine providers should have the equipment, medications, staff, and training to manage emer- gencies that may occur following vaccination.

However, females who might have been exposed to HPV or who have an equivocal or abnormal Pap test, a positive hybrid capture II high-risk test, or genital warts can receive and are likely to benefit from the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  Vaccine Available Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil, Merck) inactivated vaccine; a 0.5-mL dose contains 20 mcg HPV-6 L1 protein, 40 mcg HPV-11 L1 protein, 40 mcg HPV-16 L1 protein, and 20 mcg HPV-18 L1 protein. The vaccine does not contain thimerosal or antibiotics, but contains an alumi- num-containing adjuvant.  Dosage & Schedule of Administration HPV vaccine is administered intramuscularly as three sepa- rate 0.5-mL doses. The second dose should be administered 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the first dose. The minimum interval between the first and second dose is 4 weeks; the minimum recommended interval between the second and third doses of vaccine is 12 weeks. HPV vaccine may be administered with other vac- cines. Each vaccine should be administered using a separate syringe at a different anatomic site. If the vaccine schedule is interrupted the series does not need to be restarted.  Contraindications & Precautions Quadrivalent HPV vaccine is contraindicated in persons with a history of anaphylaxis to yeast or to any vaccine component. HPV vaccine is not recommended for use in pregnancy. The vaccine can be administered to persons with minor acute illnesses and to immunocompromised persons.  Adverse Effects Injection site pain (83.9%), and mild to moderate swelling and erythema, were the most common adverse events reported by vaccine recipients. Fever (10.3%), nausea (4.2%), and dizziness (2.8%) were reported as systemic adverse events. Postmarketing reports of syncope have been reported after vaccination with quadrivalent HPV vaccine and may follow any vaccination, so vaccine recipients should be observed for 15 minutes after vaccination.

285,Vaccinations for Special Situations,Ambulatory & Community Pediatrics ,2618,"VACCINATIONS FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS RABIES VACCINATION After symptoms of infection develop, rabies is almost invari- ably fatal in humans. Only six persons are known to have recovered from rabies infection, five of whom had either been vaccinated prior to infection or received some form of postexposure prophylaxis. The incidence of human rabies in the United States is very low, with fewer than three cases per year nationwide. Of the 37 human cases of rabies reported in the United States from 1995–2006, bat exposure was sus- pected in 28 cases. However, there was a definite history of bite in only one or two of these cases. Although dogs represent the most important vector for human rabies worldwide, in the United States, because of widespread vaccination of dogs and cats, bats are the most important cause of human rabies. Rabies is also common in skunks, raccoons, and foxes; it is uncommon in rodents. Human rabies is preventable with appropriate and timely postexposure prophylaxis. Postexposure care consists of local wound care, passive immunization, and active immunization. Immediately after an animal bite, all wounds should be flushed and aggressively cleaned with soap and water. If possible, the wound should not be sutured. Passive immunization after high-risk exposure consists of the injection of human rabies immune globulin (RIg) near the wound, as described below. Active immunization is accomplished by completing a sched- ule of immunization with one of the three rabies vaccines licensed in the United States. Because bites from bats are often unrecognized, prophylaxis should be given if a bat is found indoors even if there is no history of contact, especially if found in the same room with a sleeping or unattended child or with an intoxicated or otherwise incapacitated individual. Local public health officials should be consulted before postexposure rabies prophylaxis is started to avoid unneces- sary vaccination and to assist in the proper handling of the animal (if confinement or testing of the animal is appropri- ate). To facilitate consultation, the physician should know the species of animal, its availability for testing or confine- ment, the nature of the attack (provoked or unprovoked), and the nature of the exposure (bite, scratch, lick, or aerosol of saliva). Preexposure prophylaxis is indicated for veterinar- ians, animal handlers, and any persons whose work or home environment potentially places them in close contact with animal species in which rabies is endemic. Rabies immuniza- tion should also be considered for children traveling to countries where rabies is endemic; this is particularly impor- tant for travelers who will not have prompt access to medical care should an exposure occur.  Vaccines Available Rabies vaccines stimulate immunity after 7–10 days, and the immunity persists for 2 years or more postvaccination. Two preparations are licensed in the United States.    CHAPTER 9 266 The two currently licensed BCG vaccines in the United States are produced by Organon Teknika Corporation (Tice BCG) and Eli Lilly (BCG Vaccine). They are given intrader- mally in a dose of 0.05 mL for newborns and 0.1 mL for all other children. Mantoux testing is advised 2–3 months later, and revaccination is advised if the Mantoux test is negative. Adverse effects occur in 1–10% of healthy individuals, including local ulceration, regional lymph node enlarge- ment, and lupus vulgaris. The vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women and in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV infection, because it has caused disseminated or fatal infection. Factors associated with increased probability that a positive TB skin test is due to M tuberculosis infection include (1) larger reactions, (2) contact with an individual known to be infected, (3) family history of TB, (4) longer interval between BCG administration and skin testing, and (5) country of origin with increased incidence of endemic TB. The details and cutoff observations for TB skin testing are described in Chapter 40. To ensure that those infected with TB are evaluated, a 5-mm or greater cutoff for a positive Mantoux test is used in immunocompromised children. In immunocompetent per- sons, the cutoff is 10 mm or above, whereas it is 15 mm or above when no risk factors are present in the absence of clinical disease (eg, screening). In 2001 a new test (Quanti- Feron TB) that measures the release of interferon-γ in whole blood in response to stimulation with purified protein deriva- tive was approved by the FDA. This test is not recommended for persons with symptoms of active TB who are at increased risk of progression to active TB, but may be used instead of a TB skin test in those at increased or low risk of latent TB infection, including as screening for recent immigrants. BCG almost invariably causes its recipients to be tubercu- lin-positive (5–7 mm), but the reaction often becomes nega- tive after 3–5 years. Thus, a positive Mantoux test in a child with a history of BCG vaccination who is being investigated for TB as a case contact should be interpreted as indicating infection with M tuberculosis.

YELLOW FEVER VACCINATION Immunization against yellow fever is indicated for children as young as age 6 months traveling to endemic areas or to countries that require it for entry, but otherwise immuniza- tion should be delayed until age 9 months or older. Public health authorities maintain updated information on these requirements and must be consulted. Yellow fever vaccine is a live vaccine made from the 17D yellow fever attenuated virus strain grown in chick embryos. It is contraindicated in infants younger than age 6 months due to an increased susceptibility to vaccine-associated encephalitis, in persons with anaphylactic egg allergy, and in immunocompromised individuals or individuals with a history of thymus disease. It can only be administered at licensed yellow fever vaccination locations (usually public health departments). A single sub- cutaneous injection of 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine is administered. The International Health Regulations require revaccination at 10-year intervals, but immunity may be lifelong. Adverse reactions are generally mild—consisting of low-grade fever, mild headache, and myalgia 5–10 days after vaccination occurring in fewer than 25% of vaccinees. The risk of vaccine-associated neurotropic disease within 30 days following vaccination has been estimated to be 4–6 cases per 1 million doses. A serious adverse reaction syndrome, vac- cine-associated viscerotropic disease, consists of severe mul- tiple organ system failure and death within 1–2 weeks post- vaccination, especially in adults older than 60 years of age. The estimated incidence of this complication among vaccine recipients in the United States is 1 case per 200,000–300,000 doses distributed. Health care providers should be careful to administer yellow fever vaccine only to persons truly at risk of exposure to yellow fever. There is no contraindication to giving other live-virus vaccines simultaneously with yellow fever vaccine or at intervals of a few days to a month.

288,Passive Prophylas,Ambulatory & Community Pediatrics ,," CHAPTER 9 266 The two currently licensed BCG vaccines in the United States are produced by Organon Teknika Corporation (Tice BCG) and Eli Lilly (BCG Vaccine). They are given intrader- mally in a dose of 0.05 mL for newborns and 0.1 mL for all other children. Mantoux testing is advised 2–3 months later, and revaccination is advised if the Mantoux test is negative. Adverse effects occur in 1–10% of healthy individuals, including local ulceration, regional lymph node enlarge- ment, and lupus vulgaris. The vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women and in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV infection, because it has caused disseminated or fatal infection. Factors associated with increased probability that a positive TB skin test is due to M tuberculosis infection include (1) larger reactions, (2) contact with an individual known to be infected, (3) family history of TB, (4) longer interval between BCG administration and skin testing, and (5) country of origin with increased incidence of endemic TB. The details and cutoff observations for TB skin testing are described in Chapter 40. To ensure that those infected with TB are evaluated, a 5-mm or greater cutoff for a positive Mantoux test is used in immunocompromised children. In immunocompetent per- sons, the cutoff is 10 mm or above, whereas it is 15 mm or above when no risk factors are present in the absence of clinical disease (eg, screening). In 2001 a new test (Quanti- Feron TB) that measures the release of interferon-γ in whole blood in response to stimulation with purified protein deriva- tive was approved by the FDA. This test is not recommended for persons with symptoms of active TB who are at increased risk of progression to active TB, but may be used instead of a TB skin test in those at increased or low risk of latent TB infection, including as screening for recent immigrants. BCG almost invariably causes its recipients to be tubercu- lin-positive (5–7 mm), but the reaction often becomes nega- tive after 3–5 years. Thus, a positive Mantoux test in a child with a history of BCG vaccination who is being investigated for TB as a case contact should be interpreted as indicating infection with M tuberculosis.

These are obtained from donors known to have high titers of antibody against the organism in question. Ig must be given intramuscularly. The dose varies depending on the clinical indication. Adverse reactions include pain at the injection site, headache, chills, dyspnea, nausea, and anaphylaxis, although all but the first are rare. Prophylaxis to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and children at increased risk of severe disease is available as an intramuscular immune globulin. Palivizumab (Synagis, MedImmune) is a humanized monoclonal anti- body against RSV and is used to prevent RSV infection in high-risk populations with monthly doses during RSV sea- son. Palivizumab should be considered for (1) infants and children younger than age 2 years with chronic lung disease who have required medical therapy (supplemental oxygen, bronchodilator, diuretic, or corticosteroid therapy) for their disease within 6 months before the anticipated RSV season; (2) infants born between 33 and 35 weeks’ (32 weeks 1 day and 35 weeks 0 days) gestation or earlier without chronic lung disease with two or more risk factors (child care attendance, school-aged siblings, exposure to environmental air pollution, congenital airway abnormalities, or severe neuromuscular disease) up to age 6 months; (3) infants born at 29–32 weeks’ gestation up to 6 months of age; (4) infants up to age 12 months born at 28 weeks’ gestation or earlier; and (5) infants and children who are 24 months old or younger with hemodynamically significant cyanotic or acy- anotic congenital heart disease. Those most likely to benefit from prophylaxis are infants (< 1 year of age) who are receiving medication to control congestive heart disease, with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension and cya- notic heart disease. RSV prophylaxis should be initiated at the onset of the RSV season and continued until the end of the season, regardless of breakthrough RSV illness during that RSV season. Palivizumab is administered in a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month and is packaged in 50- and 100-mg vials. Palivi- zumab does not interfere with response to routine child- hood vaccinations. 2. Intravenous Immune Globulin The primary indications for IVIg are for replacement therapy in antibody-deficient individuals; for the treatment of Kawasaki disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other autoimmune diseases; and replacement therapy in chronic B-cell lymphocytic leu- kemia. IVIg may be beneficial in some children with HIV infection, toxic shock syndrome, and for anemia caused by parvovirus B19.

290,Nutritional Requirements,Ambulatory & Community Pediatrics ,106,"NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS NUTRITION & GROWTH The nutrient requirements of children are influenced by (1) growth rate, (2) body composition, and (3) composition of new growth. These factors vary with age and are especially important during early postnatal life. Growth rates are higher in early infancy than at any other time, including the adolescent growth spurt (Table 10–1). Growth rates decline rapidly starting in the second month of postnatal life (pro- portionately later in the premature infant). Nutrient require- ments also depend on body composition. In the adult, the brain, which accounts for only 2% of body weight, contrib- utes 19% to the total basal energy expenditure. In contrast, in a full-term neonate, the brain accounts for 10% of body weight and for 44% of total energy needs under basal conditions. Thus, in the young infant, total basal energy expenditure and the energy requirement of the brain are relatively high. Composition of new tissue is another factor influencing nutrient requirements. For example, fat accounts for about 40% of weight gain between birth and 4 months but for only 3% between 24 and 36 months. The corresponding figures for protein are 11% and 21%; for water, 45% and 68%. The high rate of fat deposition in early infancy has implications not only for energy requirements but also for the optimal composition of infant feedings. The high percentage of fat in human milk results in efficient fuel storage for the infant. Because of the high nutrient requirements for growth and the body composition, the young infant is especially vulner- able to undernutrition. Slowed physical growth rate is an early and prominent sign of undernutrition in the young infant. The limited fat stores of the very young infant mean that energy reserves are unusually modest. The relatively large size and continued growth of the brain render the central nervous system especially vulnerable to the effects of malnutrition in early postnatal life. ENERGY The major determinants of energy expenditure are (1) basal metabolism, (2) metabolic response to food, (3) physical activity, and (4) growth. The efficiency of energy use may be a significant factor, and thermoregulation may contribute in extremes of ambient temperature if the body is inadequately clothed. Because adequate data on requirements for physical activity in infants and children are unavailable and because individual growth requirements vary, recommendations have been based on calculations of actual intakes by healthy subjects. Suggested guidelines for energy intake of infants and young children are given in Table 10–2. Also included in this table are calculated energy intakes of infants who are exclusively breast fed, which have been verified in a number of centers. Growth velocity of breast-fed infants during the first 3 months equals and may exceed that of formula-fed infants, but from 6–12 months breast-fed infants typically weigh less than formula-fed infants and may show a decrease in growth velocity. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed growth standards derived from an interna- tional sample of healthy breast-fed infants and young chil- dren raised in environments that do not constrain growth. After the first 4 years, energy requirements expressed on a body weight basis decline progressively. The estimated daily energy requirement is about 40 kcal/kg/d at the end of adoles- cence. Approximate daily energy requirements can be calcu- lated by adding 100 kcal per year to the base of 1000 kcal per day at age 1 year. Appetite and growth are reliable indices of caloric needs in most healthy children, but intake also depends to some extent on the energy density of the food offered. Individual energy requirements of healthy infants and children vary con- siderably, and malnutrition and disease increase the variability. Premature infant energy requirements can exceed 120 kcal/kg/ d, especially during illness or when catch-up growth is desired. One method of calculating requirements for malnour- ished patients is to base the calculations on the “ideal body weight” (ie, 50th percentile weight for the patient’s length-  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

There is conclusive evidence that folic acid supplements (400 mcg/d) during the periconceptional period protect against neural tube defects. Dietary intakes of folic acid from natural foods and enriched products also are protective. Biologic roles of water-soluble vitamins are listed in Table 10–12. The risk of toxicity from water-soluble vitamins is not as great as that associated with fat-soluble vitamins because excesses are excreted in the urine (see Table 10–8). However, deficiencies of these vitamins develop more quickly than deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins because of limited stores (see Table 10–7). Additional salient details are summarized in Table 10–13. Although dietary intake of the water-soluble vitamins on a daily basis is not necessary, these vitamins, with the exception of vitamin B12, are not stored in the body to significant levels. Recommended intakes appear in Table 10–9. Carnitine is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from lysine and methionine. In certain circumstances (see Table 10–12) synthesis is inadequate, and carnitine can then be considered a vitamin. A dietary supply of other organic compounds, such as inositol, may also be required in certain circumstances. Bryan J et al: Nutrients for cognitive development in school-aged children.

297,Infant Feeding,Ambulatory & Community Pediatrics ,1452,"INFANT FEEDING BREAST FEEDING Breast feeding provides optimal nutrition for the normal infant during the early months of life. WHO recommends exclusive breast feeding for approximately the first 6 months of life, with continued breast feeding along with appropriate complementary foods through the first 2 years of life. Numer- ous immunologic factors in breast milk (including secretory IgA, lysozyme, lactoferrin, bifidus factor, and macrophages) provide protection against GI and upper respiratory infec- tions. In developing countries, lack of refrigeration and con- taminated water supplies make formula feeding hazardous. Although formulas have improved progressively and are made to resemble breast milk as closely as possible, it is Table 10–6. Supplemental fluoride  recommendations (mg/d).

Gradual introduction of a variety of foods, including fortified cereals, fruits, vegetables, and meats, should complement the breast milk diet. Meats provide an important dietary source of iron and zinc, both of which are low in human milk by 6 months, and pureed meats may be introduced as an early comple- mentary food. Single-ingredient complementary foods are introduced one at a time at weekly intervals before a new food is given. Fruit juice is not an essential part of an infant diet. Juice should not be introduced until after 6 months; should only be offered in a cup; and the amount should be limited to 4 oz/d. Breast feeding should ideally continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired. Infants who are not breast fed should receive stan- dard iron-fortified infant formula. Whole cow’s milk can be introduced after the first year of life. Kramer MS et al: Infant growth and health outcomes associated with 3 compared with 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding.

SPECIAL DIETARY PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS Soy Protein Formulas Historically, a common rationale for the use of soy protein formulas was the transient lactose intolerance after acute gastroenteritis. Lactose-free cow’s milk protein–based formu- las are also now available. These formulas are also useful for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency. Soy protein formulas are often used in cases of suspected intolerance to cow’s milk protein. Although infants with true cow’s milk protein intolerance may also be intolerant of soy protein, those with documented IgE-mediated allergy to cow’s milk protein usually do well on soy formula. Semi-Elemental & Elemental Formulas Semi-elemental formulas include protein hydrolysate for- mulas. The major nitrogen source of most of these products is casein hydrolysate, supplemented with selected amino acids, but partial hydrolysates of whey are also available. These formulas contain an abundance of EFA from vegetable oil; certain brands also provide substantial amounts of MCTs. Elemental formulas are available with free amino acids and varying levels and types of fat components. Semi-elemental and elemental formulas are invaluable for infants with a wide variety of malabsorption syndromes. They are also effective in infants who cannot tolerate cow’s milk and soy protein. Controlled trials suggest that for infants with a family history of atopic disease, partial hydrolysate formulas may delay or prevent atopic disease. For specific product information, consult standard pediatric reference texts, for- mula manufacturers, or a pediatric dietitian.

Am J Clin Nutr 2003;78:296 [PMID: 12885712]. Formula Additives Occasionally it may be necessary to increase the caloric den- sity of an infant feeding to provide more calories or restrict fluid intake. Concentrating formula to 24–26 kcal/oz is usu- ally well tolerated, delivers an acceptable renal solute load, and increases the density of all the nutrients. Beyond this, individ- ual macronutrient additives (Table 10–15) are usually employed to achieve the desired caloric density (up to 30 kcal/oz) based on the infant’s needs and underlying condition(s). A pediatric nutrition specialist can be helpful in formulating calorically dense infant formula feedings. The caloric density of breast milk can be increased by adding infant formula powder or any of the additives used with infant formula. Human milk fortifiers are generally used only for premature infants because of their specialized nutrient composition. Special Formulas Special formulas are those in which one component, often an amino acid, is reduced in concentration or removed for the dietary management of a specific inborn metabolic disease. Also included under this heading are formulas designed for the management of specific disease states, such as hepatic failure, pulmonary failure with chronic carbon dioxide reten- tion, and renal failure. These condition-specific formulas were formulated primarily for critically ill adults and are even used sparingly in those populations; thus their use in pediatrics should only be undertaken with clear indication and caution. Complete information regarding the composition of these special formulas, the standard infant formulas, specific metabolic disease formulas, and premature infant formulas can be found in standard reference texts and in the manufac- turers’ literature.

304,Nutrition for the Older Child,Immunization ,5074,"NUTRITION FOR THE OLDER CHILD Because of the association of diet with the development of such chronic diseases as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, learning a healthy eating behavior at a young age is an important preventative measure. Salient features of the diet for children older than 2 years include the following:    NORMAL CHILDHOOD NUTRITION & ITS DISORDERS 283 1. Consumption of three regular meals per day, and two or three healthful snacks according to appetite, activity, and growth needs. 2. Inclusion of a variety of foods. Diet should be nutrition- ally complete and promote optimal growth and activity. 3. Fat should comprise less than 35% of total calories (Severe fat restriction may result in an energy deficit and growth failure). Saturated fats should provide less than 10% of total calories. Monounsaturated fats should provide 10% or more of caloric intake. Consumption of trans-fatty acids, found in stick margarine and shorten- ing, and in many processed foods, should be kept as low as possible. 4. Cholesterol intake less than 100 mg/1000 kcal/d, to a maximum of 300 mg/d. 5. Carbohydrates should provide 45–65% of daily caloric intake, with no more than 10% in the form of simple sugars. A high-fiber, whole-grain-based diet is recom- mended. 6. Limitation of grazing behavior, eating while watching television, and the consumption of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages. 7. Limitation of sodium intake by choosing fresh over processed foods. The consumption of lean cuts of meats, poultry, and fish should be encouraged. Skim or low-fat milk, soft margarine, and vegetable oils (especially canola or olive oil) should be used. Whole-grain bread and cereals and plentiful amounts of fruits and vegetables are recommended. The consumption of pro- cessed foods, soft drinks, desserts, and candy should be limited. A prudent diet should be only one component of counsel- ing on lifestyles for children. Other aspects are the maintenance of a desirable body weight; promotion of regular physical activity and limiting sedentary behaviors; avoidance of smok- ing; and screening for hypertension. Universal screening for total cholesterol is controversial. Current recommendations are to routinely screen those children who have a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease, although this approach will identify only about 50% of those with signifi- cantly elevated cholesterol levels. If the result is high (≥ 200 mg/ dL), a fasting lipoprotein analysis should be obtained.

316,Advanced Life Support for Infants & Children,Immunization ,68,"ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT  FOR INFANTS & CHILDREN When faced with a seriously ill or injured child, a systematic approach and rapid determination of the child’s physiologic status with concurrent initiation of resuscitative measures is imperative. Initial management must be directed at correct- ing any physiologic derangement. Specifically, one must evaluate the airway for any obstruction, assess ventilatory status, and evaluate for shock. Intervention to correct any abnormalities in these three parameters must be undertaken immediately. Following this initial intervention the provider must then carefully consider the underlying cause, focusing on those that are treatable or reversible. Specific diagnoses can then be made, and targeted therapy (eg, intravenous [IV] glucose for hypoglycemia) can be initiated. Pediatric cardiac arrest more frequently represents pro- gressive respiratory deterioration or shock rather than pri- mary cardiac etiologies. Unrecognized deterioration may lead to bradycardia, agonal breathing, and ultimately asys- tole. Resulting hypoxic and ischemic insult to the brain and other vital organs make neurologic recovery extremely unlikely, even in the doubtful event that the child survives the arrest. Children who respond to rapid intervention with ventilation and oxygenation alone or to less than 5 minutes of advanced life support are much more likely to survive neurologically intact. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the child who is at risk for progressing to cardiopulmonary arrest and to provide aggressive intervention before asystole occurs. Note: Standard precautions (personal protective equip- ment) must be maintained during resuscitation efforts. THE ABCS OF RESUSCITATION Any severely ill child should be rapidly evaluated in a deliberate sequence of airway patency, breathing adequacy, and circulation integrity. Derangement at each point must be corrected before proceeding. Thus, if a child’s airway is obstructed, the airway must be opened (eg, by head position- ing and the chin lift maneuver) before breathing and circu- lation are assessed. Airway Look, listen, and feel for upper airway patency: Look for chest or abdominal wall movement suggestive of breathing effort. Listen for adventitious breath sounds such as stridor, stertor, or gurgling. Placing a stethoscope at the mouth or over the trachea improves the ability to hear air entry. Feel for air movement with your face near the child’s mouth and nose. Evidence of spontaneous breathing effort and increased work of breathing without air movement is suggestive of airway obstruction. Significant airway obstruction often is associated with altered level of consciousness, including agitation or lethargy. The airway is managed initially by noninvasive means such as oxygen administration, chin lift, jaw thrust, suction- ing, or bag–valve–mask ventilation. Invasive maneuvers such as endotracheal intubation, laryngeal mask insertion, or rarely, cricothyroidotomy are required if the aforementioned maneuvers are unsuccessful. If neck injury is suspected, the cervical spine must be immobilized and kept from extension or flexion. (See section on Approach to the Pediatric Trauma Patient, later.) The following discussion assumes that basic life support has been instituted. Knowledge of pediatric anatomy is important for airway management. Children’s tongues are large relative to their oral cavities, and the larynx is high and anteriorly located. Infants are obligate nasal breathers; therefore, secretions or blood in the nasopharynx can cause significant distress. A. Place the head in the sniffing position. The neck should be slightly flexed and the head gently extended so as to bring the face forward. This position aligns the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal planes. Reposition the head if airway obstruction persists after head tilt and jaw thrust. In infants and children younger than about 8 years of age, the  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Chest radiographs may show cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. An initial bolus of crystalloid may be given, but pressors, and possibly afterload reducers, are necessary to improve perfusion. Giving multiple boluses of fluid is deleterious. Comprehensive cardiopulmonary moni- toring is essential. Children in cardiogenic shock must be admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit.  Observation & Further Management Clinically reassess physiologic response to each fluid bolus to determine additional needs. Serial central venous pressure determinations or a chest radiograph may help determine volume status. Place an indwelling urinary catheter to mon- itor urine output. Caution must be exercised with volume replacement if intracranial pressure is potentially elevated, as in severe head injury, diabetic ketoacidosis, or meningitis. Even in such situations, however, normal intravascular volume must be restored in order to achieve adequate mean arterial pressure and, thus, cerebral perfusion pressure. SUMMARY OF CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION Assess the ABCs in sequential fashion and, before assessing the next system, immediately intervene if physiologic derangement is detected. It is essential that each system be reassessed after each intervention to ensure improvement and prevent failure to recognize clinical deterioration.

EMERGENCY PEDIATRIC DRUGS Although careful attention to airway and breathing remains the mainstay of pediatric resuscitation, medications are often needed. Rapid delivery to the central circulation, which can be via peripheral IV catheter, is essential. Infuse medications close to the catheter’s hub and flush in with saline to achieve the most rapid systemic effects. If no IV or IO access is achievable, some drugs may be given by endo- tracheal tube (Table 11–1). The use of length-based emer- gency measuring tapes that contain preprinted drug dos- ages, equipment sizes, and IV fluid amounts (Broselow tapes) or preprinted resuscitation drug charts is much more accurate than estimation formulas and helps minimize dosing errors. Selected emergency drugs used in pediatrics are summarized in Table 11–2. "
321,Approach to the Seriously Ill Child,Immunization ,2946,"APPROACH TO THE SERIOUSLY ILL CHILD An unstable patient may present with a known diagnosis (asthma with status asthmaticus and respiratory failure; complications of known congenital heart disease) or in cardiorespiratory failure of unknown cause. The initial approach must rapidly identify and reverse life-threatening conditions. Children with chronic disease may present with an acute exacerbation or secondary to a new, unrelated problem. PREPARATION FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT Resuscitation occurs simultaneously at two levels: rapid cardiopulmonary assessment, with indicated stabilizing measures, while venous access is gained and cardiopulmo- nary monitoring initiated. The technique of accomplishing these concurrent goals is outlined as follows: A. If advance notice of the patient’s arrival has been received, prepare a resuscitation room and summon appro- priate personnel as needed, such as a neurosurgeon for an unresponsive child after severe head injury or a radiology technician for imaging studies. B. Assign team responsibilities, including a team leader plus others designated to manage the airway, perform chest compressions, achieve access, draw blood for laboratory studies, place monitors, gather additional historical data, and provide family support. The team approach is invaluable. C. Age-appropriate equipment (including laryngo- scope blade, endotracheal tubes, nasogastric or orogastric tubes, IV lines, and an indwelling urinary catheter) and monitors (cardiorespiratory monitor, pulse oximeter, and appropriate blood pressure cuff) should be assembled and readily available. Use a length-based emergency tape if available. See Table 11–3 for endotracheal tube sizes. Cuffed endotracheal tubes are acceptable during the in- patient setting for children and infants beyond the new- born period. Cuff inflation pressures must be carefully Table 11–1.

323,Approach to the Pediatric Trauma Patient,Immunization ,964,"APPROACH TO THE PEDIATRIC  TRAUMA PATIENT Injuries, including motor vehicle crashes, falls, burns, and immersions, account for the greatest number of deaths among children older than age 1 year. All providers of pediatric care must be cognizant of this sobering statistic. Cooperative efforts between injury prevention specialists, prehospital providers, and emergency, critical care, and rehabilitation physicians and nurses will help reduce these terrible losses. A team approach to the severely injured child, using assigned roles as outlined in the preceding section, will optimize outcomes. A calm atmosphere in the receiving area will contribute to thoughtful care. Conscious children are terribly frightened by serious injury; reassurance can help alleviate anxiety. Analgesia and sedation must be given to stable patients. It is unconscionable to let children suffer pain needlessly. Treat pain expeditiously using oral or paren- teral analgesics with ongoing monitoring. Parents are often anxious, angry, or guilty, requiring ongoing support from staff, social workers, or child life workers (therapists knowl- edgeable about child development). To provide optimal multidisciplinary care, regional pediatric trauma centers provide dedicated teams of pediatric specialists in emergency pediatrics, trauma surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and critical care. Most children with severe injuries are not seen Table 11–3. Equipment sizes and estimated weight by age.

328,Head Injury,Immunization ,446,"HEAD INJURY Closed head injuries range in severity from minor asympto- matic trauma without sequelae, to those leading to death. Head injury, including the shaken-baby syndrome, is com- mon in cases of child abuse. Even following minor closed head injury, neuropsychiatric sequelae can occur. ASSESSMENT The considerations discussed earlier in the Approach to the Pediatric Trauma Patient section apply here as well. The history should include the time, mechanism, and details of the injury. Distance of the fall, landing surface, level of consciousness at event, subsequent mental status and activity, amnesia, and vomiting are important details to obtain. The physical examination, including a detailed neuro- logic examination, should be complete and mindful of the mechanism of injury. Look for associated injuries such as mandibular fracture, scalp or skull injury, or cervical spine injury. Cerebrospinal fluid leak from the ears or nose or the later appearance of periorbital hematomas (raccoon eyes) or Battle sign imply basilar skull fracture and indicate the need for pneumococcal vaccine. Obtain vital signs and assess the child’s level of consciousness by the AVPU system (see Table 11–4) or Glasgow Coma Scale (see Table 11–5), noting irritability or lethargy; pupillary equality, size, and reaction to light; funduscopic examination; reflexes; body posture; and rectal tone. Always consider child abuse; the injuries observed should be consistent with the history and the child’s developmental level. Radiographic studies may be indicated. Plain films are useful only in cases of penetrating head trauma or for ruling out foreign bodies. Major morbidity does not result directly from skull fractures, but rather from the associated intracranial injury. CT scans should be performed based on clinical findings in the child with persistent vomiting or an abnormal or lateralizing neurologic examination, including an abnormal mental status that does not quickly return to normal. In infants, a normal neurologic examina- tion does not exclude significant intracranial hemorrhage; in the setting of an appropriate mechanism, and if scalp findings such as large hematomas are found, consider performing CT. CONCUSSION A concussion injury is defined as a brief loss or alteration of consciousness followed by a return to normal. Brain tissue is not damaged, and there are no focal findings on detailed neurologic examination. There may be pallor, amnesia, or several episodes of vomiting. Disposition is based on the clinical course and suitability of follow-up. The patient may be discharged when neurologically normal after a period of obser- vation. Parents should closely observe the child at home and return if the child exhibits altered level of consciousness, persistent vomiting, gait disturbances, unequal pupils, seizures, or increasing headache, or if the parents have any concerns. CONTUSION A bruise of the brain matter is a contusion. The child’s level of consciousness decreases, and focal findings, if any, corre- spond to the area of the brain that is injured. These patients require CT scan, a period of observation, and consideration of neurorehabilitation follow-up for post-traumatic brain injury sequelae. DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY Diffuse axonal injury is a potentially severe form of traumatic brain injury characterized by coma without focal signs on neurologic examination. No external signs of trauma may be apparent. The initial CT scan is normal or may demonstrate only scattered small areas of cerebral contusion and areas of low density. Prolonged disability may follow diffuse axonal injury. ACUTE INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION Close observation will detect early signs and symptoms of intracranial pressure elevation. Early recognition is essential to avoid disastrous outcomes. In addition to traumatic causes, intracranial pressure elevation with or without herniation syn- dromes may be seen in spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, CNS infection, hydrocephalus, ruptured arteriovenous malfor- mation, metabolic derangement (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis), ventriculoperitoneal shunt obstruction, or tumor. Symptoms include headache, vision changes, vomiting, gait difficulties, and a progressively decreasing level of consciousness. Other signs may include stiff neck, cranial nerve palsies, and progres- sive hemiparesis. Cushing triad (bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations) is a late and ominous finding. Papilledema is also a late finding. Consider CT scan before lumbar puncture if there is concern about intracranial pressure elevation because of the risk of precipitating herniation. Lum- bar puncture should be deferred if the patient is unstable.  Treatment Therapy for intracranial pressure elevation must be swift and aggressive. Strict attention to adequate oxygenation, ventila-    EMERGENCIES & INJURIES 307 tion, and perfusion is paramount. Controlled rapid sequence intubation with appropriate sedation, muscle relaxation, agents to reduce the intracranial pressure elevation that accompanies intubation, and avoidance of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are all important aspects of treatment. Brief periods of hyperventilation are reserved for acute herniation. Mannitol (0.5 g/kg IV), an osmotic diuretic, will reduce brain water, as will furosemide (0.1–0.2 mg/kg IV). Hypertonic saline (3%) is also used for this purpose. These measures may acutely lower intracranial pressure. Fluid infusion and, ulti- mately, pressors should be used to maintain normal arterial blood pressure and peripheral perfusion, if necessary. Adjunctive measures include elevating the head of the bed 30 degrees, treating hyperpyrexia and pain, and maintaining the head in a midline position. Obtain immediate neurosurgical evaluation. Further details about management of intracranial hypertension (cerebral edema) are presented in Chapter 13. DISPOSITION FOR CHILDREN WITH CLOSED HEAD INJURY Patients with mild head injury may be discharged with detailed written instructions, if the examination remains normal after a period of observation and parental supervi- sion and follow-up are appropriate. Children with persistent deficits require admission or prolonged observation. In patients whose mental status improves over time, observa- tion may be done without further radiographic studies. If mental status deteriorates, however, CT scan and neurosur- gical consultation are indicated. If the CT scan is normal and the neurologic findings normalize, these children may be discharged after a period of observation. Patients with severe head injury require cerebral resuscitation, evaluation by a neurosurgeon, and admission to hospital. Dias MS: Traumatic brain and spinal cord injury.

329,Burns,Normal Childhood Nutrition  & Its Disorders ,2126,"BURNS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Burn classification depends on location and extent of injury.  Burns of the hands, feet, face, eyes, ears, and perineum are always considered to be major burns. Thermal injury is a major cause of accidental death and disfigurement in children. Pain, morbidity, the association with child abuse, and the preventable nature of burns consti- tute an area of major concern in pediatrics. Common causes include hot water or food, appliances, flames, grills, vehicle- related burns, and curling irons. Burns occur commonly in toddlers—in boys more frequently than in girls. EVALUATION OF THE BURNED PATIENT Classification Burns are classified clinically according to the nature of the burn and the extent and thickness; associated injuries are ascertained in the initial evaluation. Superficial burns are easily recognized and treated. They are painful, dry, red, and hypersensitive. Sunburn is a com- mon example. Healing occurs with minimal damage to epi- dermis. Partial-thickness burns are subgrouped as superficial or deep, depending on appearance and healing time. Each subgroup is treated differently. Superficial partial-thickness burns are red and often blister. Deep partial-thickness burns are white and dry, blanch with pressure, and the involved skin has decreased sensitivity to pain. Full-thickness burns affect all epidermal and dermal elements, leaving devascularized skin. The wound is white or black, dry, depressed, leathery in appearance, and without sensation. Unless skin grafting is provided, the scar will be hard, uneven, and fibrotic. Deep full- thickness, or subdermal, burns are the most severe, extending through all layers of skin as well as into the underlying fascia, muscle, and possibly bone. Management Management also depends on the depth and extent of injury. Burn extent can be classified as major or minor. Minor burns are less than 10% of the body surface area for superficial and partial-thickness burns, or less than 2% for full-thickness burns. Partial- or full-thickness burns of the hands, feet, face, eyes, ears, and perineum are considered major. A. Superficial and Partial-Thickness Burns These injuries can generally be treated in the outpatient setting. It is mandatory that effective analgesia be rapidly provided, and redosed as indicated by the child. Oral codeine or parenteral narcotics are indicated. Superficial burns are treated with cool compresses and analgesia. Treatment of partial-thickness burns with blisters consists of antiseptic cleansing, topical antimicro- bial coverage, and observation for infection. Blisters appear early in deeper partial-thickness burns and, if open, may be debrided. Alternatively, the blister may be used as a protective flap after cleaning and dressing. After debridement, the wound should be cleansed with dilute (1–5%) povidone-iodine solu- tion, thoroughly washed with normal saline, and covered with topical antibiotic. The wound should be protected with a bulky dressing and reexamined within 24 hours and serially thereafter. Wounds with a potential to cause disfigurement or functional impairment—especially wounds of the hand or digits—should    CHAPTER 11 308 be referred promptly to a burn surgeon. Outpatient analgesia should be provided on discharge. B. Full-Thickness, Deep or Extensive  Partial-Thickness, and Subdermal Burns Major burns require particular attention to the ABCs of trauma management. Early establishment of an artificial airway is critical with oral or nasal burns because of their association with inhalation injuries and critical airway narrowing. The protocol for the primary survey should be followed (see earlier discussion). There may be inhalation injury from carbon monoxide, cyanide, or other toxic products. A naso- gastric tube and bladder catheter should be placed. The secondary survey should ascertain whether any other injuries are present, including those suggestive of abuse. Fluid administration is based on several principles. Cap- illary permeability is markedly increased. Fluid needs are based on examination findings, percentage of body surface area burned, depth, and age. Maintaining normal intravas- cular pressure and replacing fluid losses are essential. Figure 11–9 shows percentages of body surface area by body part in infants and children. The Parkland formula for fluid therapy is 4 mL/kg/% body surface area burned for the first 24 hours, with half in the first 8 hours, in addition to maintenance rates. Acutely, however, fluid resuscitation should be based on clinical assessment of volume status. Indications for admission include major burns as previ- ously defined, uncertainty of follow-up, suspicion of abuse, presence of upper airway injury, explosion, inhalation, elec- trical or chemical burns, burns associated with fractures, or the need for parenteral pain control. Children with chronic metabolic or connective tissue diseases and infants deserve hospitalization. Children with subdermal burns require immediate hospitalization at a burn center under the care of a burn specialist, fluid resuscitation, debridement of the wound, and placement of temporary wound coverage. ELECTRICAL BURNS Even brief contact with a high-voltage source will result in a contact burn. When an infant or toddler bites an electric cord, burns to the commissure of the lips occur that appear gray and necrotic, with surrounding erythema. If an arc is created with passage of current through the body, the pattern of the thermal injury will depend on the path of the current; there- fore, search for an exit wound and internal injuries. Extensive damage to deep tissues may occur. Current traversing the heart may cause nonperfusing arrhythmias. Neurologic effects of electrical burns can be immediate (eg, confusion, disorien- tation, peripheral nerve injury), delayed (eg, nerve damage in the thrombosed limb after compartment syndrome), or late (eg, impaired concentration or memory).

Ventricular fibrillation may occur spontaneously or as a result of minor handling or invasive procedures. If asystole or ventricular fibrillation is present on the cardiac monitor, perform chest compressions and use standard pediatric advanced life support techniques as indicated. Defibrillation and pharmacologic therapy should be initiated as appropri- ate but may not be successful until core rewarming has occurred. Spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm at 28–30°C may take place as rewarming proceeds. B. Rewarming Remove wet clothing from all patients. Rewarming tech- niques are categorized as passive external, active external, or active core rewarming. The method chosen is based on the degree of hypothermia. Passive rewarming, such as covering with blankets, is appropriate only for mild cases (> 33°C). Active external rewarming methods include warming lights, thermal mattresses or electric warming blankets, immersion in warm baths, and hot water bottles or warmed bags of IV solutions. One must be aware of the potential for core temperature depression after rewarming has begun, as vaso- dilation allows cooler peripheral blood to be distributed to the core circulation. Active core rewarming techniques are used alone or in combination with active external warming for moderate to severe hypothermia. The techniques include the delivery of warmed, humidified oxygen and the use of warmed (to 40°C) fluids for IV replacement, peritoneal dialysis, and mediastinal lavage. Bladder and bowel irrigation are not generally effective because of low surface areas for tempera- ture exchange. Extracorporeal blood rewarming achieves controlled core rewarming, can stabilize volume and electro- lyte disturbances, and is maximally effective (Table 11–6).

332,Submersion Injuries,Normal Childhood Nutrition  & Its Disorders ,2037,"SUBMERSION INJURIES ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  CNS and pulmonary injuries account for major morbidity.  Child may appear well at presentation, but late CNS and pulmonary changes can occur hours later.  Minimum observation period is 8–12 hours. Drowning is the second most common cause of death by unintentional injury among children. Water hazards are ubiquitous and include lakes and streams, swimming pools, bathtubs, and even toilets, buckets, and washing machines. Risk factors include epilepsy, alcohol, and lack of supervi- sion. Males predominate in submersion deaths, as in most other nonintentional deaths. Prevention is paramount. Major morbidity stems from CNS and pulmonary insult. Laryngospasm or breath-holding may lead to loss of con- sciousness and cardiovascular collapse before aspiration can occur (dry drowning). Anoxia from laryngospasm or aspira- tion leads to irreversible CNS damage after only 4–6 minutes. A child must fall through ice or directly into icy water for cerebral metabolism to be slowed sufficiently by hypothermia to provide protection from anoxic damage. Cardiovascular changes include myocardial depression and arrhythmias. Elec- trolyte alterations are generally slight. Unless hemolysis occurs, hemoglobin concentrations also change only slightly.  Clinical Findings & Treatment Depending on the duration of submersion and any protec- tive hypothermia effects, children may appear clinically dead or completely normal. Observation over time assists with prognosis. The child who has been rewarmed to at least 33°C and is still apneic and pulseless will probably not survive to discharge or will be left with severe neurologic deficits. Until a determination of brain death can be made, however, aggressive resuscitation should be continued in a patient with return of circulation. One should keep in mind possible associated injuries, including head or neck trauma. For children who appear well initially, observation for 8–12 hours will detect late pulmonary  Table 11–6. Management of hypothermia. General measures Remove wet clothing. Administer warmed and humidified 100% oxygen. Monitor core temperature, heart and respiratory rates, and blood  pressure continuously.

Laboratory studies Complete blood count and platelets Serum electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, amylase Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time Arterial blood gases Consider toxicology screen Treatment Correct hypoxemia, hypercapnia, pH < 7.2, clotting abnormalities,  and glucose and electrolyte disturbances. Start rewarming techniques: passive, active (core and external),  depending on degree of hypothermia. Replace intravascular volume with warmed intravenous crystalloid  infusion at 42°C. Treat asystole and ventricular fibrillation per PALS protocols.  Continue cardiac massage at least until core temperature reaches  30°C, when defibrillation is more likely to be effective.

Respiratory distress, an abnormal chest radiograph, abnormal arterial blood gases, or hypoxemia by pulse oximetry indicates the need for treatment with supplemental oxygen, cardiopulmo- nary monitoring, and frequent reassessment. Serially assess respiratory distress and mental status. Signs of pulmonary infection may appear many hours after the submersion event. Patients who are in coma and who require mechanical ventilation have a high risk of anoxic encephalopathy.

333,Animal & Human Bites,Normal Childhood Nutrition  & Its Disorders ,799,"ANIMAL & HUMAN BITES Bites account for a large number of visits to the emergency department. Most fatalities are due to dog bites. However, human and cat bites cause the majority of infected bite wounds. DOG BITES Boys are bitten more frequently than girls, and the dog is known by the victim in most cases. Younger children have a higher incidence of head and neck wounds, whereas school- age children are bitten most often on the upper extremities. Dog bites are treated similarly to other wounds: high- pressure, high-volume irrigation with normal saline, debride- ment of any devitalized tissue, removal of foreign matter, and tetanus prophylaxis. The risk of rabies from dogs is low in developed countries, but rabies prophylaxis should be considered when appropriate. Wounds should be sutured only if necessary for cosmetic reasons because wound closure increases the risk of infection. Prophylactic antibiotics have not been proven to decrease rates of infection in low-risk dog bite wounds not involving the hands or feet. If a bite involves a joint, periosteum, or neurovascular bundle, prompt ortho- pedic surgery consultation should be obtained. Pathogens that infect dog bites include Pasteurella canis and P multocida, streptococci, staphylococci, and anaerobes. Infected dog bites can be treated with penicillin for P multocida, and broad-spectrum coverage can be provided by amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or cephalexin (see dose for cat bites in the next section). Complications of dog bites include scarring, CNS infections, septic arthritis, osteomyeli- tis, endocarditis, and sepsis. CAT BITES Cat-inflicted wounds occur more frequently in girls, and their principal complication is infection. The infection risk is higher in cat bites than dog bites because cat bites produce a puncture wound. Management is similar to that for dog bites. Cat wounds should not be sutured except when absolutely neces- sary for cosmetic reasons. P multocida is the most common pathogen. Cat bites create a puncture-wound inoculum, and prophylactic antibiotics (penicillin plus cephalexin, or amoxi- cillin and clavulanic acid) are recommended. The dose of amoxicillin trihydrate and clavulanic acid should be on the high side of recommended dosage in order to ensure adequate tissue penetration both in dog and cat bites. The dosage of the amoxicillin component should be 80 mg/kg/24 h in three divided doses. The maximum dosage is 2 g/24 h. Scratches or bites from cats may also result in cat scratch fever. HUMAN BITES Most human bites occur during fights. P multocida is not a known pathogen in human bites; cultures most commonly grow streptococci, staphylococci, anaerobes, and Eikenella cor- rodens. Hand wounds and deep wounds should be treated with antibiotic coverage against E corrodens and gram-positive pathogens by a penicillinase-resistant antibiotic. Wound man- agement is the same as for dog bites. Only severe lacerations involving the face should be sutured. Other wounds can be managed by delayed primary closure or healing by secondary intention. A major complication of human bite wounds is infection of the metacarpophalangeal joints. A hand surgeon should evaluate clenched-fist injuries from human bites. Oper- ative debridement is followed in many cases by IV antibiotics. Younggren BN: Emergency management of difficulty wounds: Part I. Emerg Med Clin North Am 2007;25:101 [PMID: 17400075]. PROCEDURAL SEDATION  & ANALGESIA (PSA) Relief of pain and anxiety are paramount concepts in the provision of acute care pediatrics, and should be considered at all times. Many agents also have amnestic properties. Parenteral agents can be effective and safe and produce few side effects if used judiciously. Conditions such as fracture reduction, laceration repair, burn care, sexual assault examinations, lumbar puncture, and diagnostic procedures such as CT and magnetic resonance imaging may all be performed more effectively and compas- sionately if effective sedation or analgesia is used. The clinician should decide whether procedures will require sedation, anal- gesia, or both, and then choose agents accordingly. Safe and effective sedation requires thorough knowledge of the selected agent and its side effects, as well as suitable monitoring devices, resuscitative medications, equipment, and personnel. The decision to perform PSA must be patient-oriented and tailored to specific procedural needs, while ensuring the child’s safety throughout the procedure.     313 12 Poisoning Barry H. Rumack, MD Richard C. Dart, MD, PhD Accidental and intentional exposures to toxic substances occur in children of all ages. Children younger than age 6 years are primarily involved in accidental exposures, with the peak incidence in 2-year-olds. Of the more than 2.5 million exposures reported by the American Association of Poison Control Centers’ National Poison Data System in 2006, 51% occurred in children aged 5 years and under, 6% in those aged 6–12 years, and 7% in those aged 13–19 years. Young children are occasionally exposed to intentional poisoning through the actions of parents or caregivers. Administration of agents such as diphenhydramine to induce sleep in a day- care setting, Münchausen syndrome by proxy to obtain parental secondary gain, or deliberate harm should be sus- pected when the history is not consistent. Involvement of child abuse specialists is very helpful in these cases. (See Chapter 7.) Adolescents are involved in intentional episodes when attempting suicide or experimenting with various drugs and agents. In some locales, small-scale industrial or manufacturing processes may be associated with homes and farms, and exposures to hazardous substances should be considered in the history.

335,Pharmacologic Principles of Tocology,Normal Childhood Nutrition  & Its Disorders ,1441,"PHARMACOLOGIC PRINCIPLES  OF TOXICOLOGY In the evaluation of the poisoned patient, it is important to compare the anticipated pharmacologic or toxic effects with the patient’s clinical presentation. If the history is that the patient ingested a tranquilizer 30 minutes ago, but the clinical examination reveals dilated pupils, tachycardia, dry mouth, absent bowel sounds, and active hallucinations— clearly anticholinergic toxicity—diagnosis and therapy should proceed accordingly. LD50 Estimates of the LD50 (the amount per kilogram of body weight of a drug required to kill 50% of a group of experi- mental animals) or median lethal dose are of little clinical value in humans. It is usually impossible to determine with accuracy the amount swallowed or absorbed, the metabolic status of the patient, or in which patients the response to the agent will be atypical. Furthermore, these values are often not valid in humans even if the history is accurate. Half-Life (t1/2) The t1/2 of an agent must be interpreted carefully. Most published t1/2 values are for therapeutic dosages. The t1/2 may increase as the quantity of the ingested substance increases for many common intoxicants such as salicylates. One can- not rely on the published t1/2 for salicylate (2 hours) to assume rapid elimination of the drug. In an acute salicylate overdose (150 mg/kg), the apparent t1/2 is prolonged to 24– 30 hours. Volume of Distribution The volume of distribution (Vd) of a drug is determined by dividing the amount of drug absorbed by the blood level. With theophylline, for example, the Vd is 0.46 L/kg body weight, or 32 L in an average adult. In contrast, digoxin distributes well beyond total body water. Because the calculation produces a volume above body weight this figure is referred to as an “apparent volume of distribution” (Table 12–1). The Vd can be useful in predicting which drugs will be removed by dialysis or exchange transfusion. When a drug is differentially concentrated in body lipids or is heavily tissue or protein bound and has a high Vd, only a small proportion of the drug will be in the free form and thus accessible to diuresis, dialysis, or exchange transfusion. A drug that is water soluble, can be ionized, and has a low Vd may cross  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

In general, methods of extracorporeal elimination are not effective for toxic agents with a Vd greater than 1 L/kg. Metabolism & Excretion The route of excretion or detoxification is important for planning treatment. Methanol, for example, is metabolized to the toxic product, formic acid. This metabolic step may be blocked by the antidote fomepizole or ethanol. Blood Levels Care of the poisoned patient should never be guided solely by laboratory measurements. Treatment should be directed first by the clinical signs and symptoms, followed by more specific therapy based on laboratory determinations. Clinical information may speed the identification of a toxic agent by the laboratory. "

Enhancement of Excretion Excretion of certain substances can be hastened by urinary alkalinization or dialysis. It is important to make certain that the patient is not volume depleted. Volume-depleted patients should receive a normal saline bolus of 10–20 mL/ kg, followed by sufficient IV fluid administration to main- tain urine output at 2–3 mL/kg/h. A. Urinary Alkalinization 1. Alkaline diuresis—Urinary alkalinization should be cho- sen on the basis of the substance’s pKa, so that ionized drug will be trapped in the tubular lumen and not reabsorbed (see Table 12–1). Thus, if the pKa is less than 7.5, urinary alkalinization is appropriate; if it is over 8.0, this technique is not usually beneficial. The pKa is sometimes included along with general drug information. Urinary alkalinization is achieved with sodium bicarbonate. It is important to observe for hypokalemia, caused by the shift of potassium intracellu- larly. Follow serum K+ and observe for electrocardiogram (ECG) evidence of hypokalemia. If complications such as renal failure or pulmonary edema are present, hemodialysis or hemoperfusion may be required. B. Dialysis Hemodialysis (or peritoneal dialysis if hemodialysis is unavailable) is useful in the poisonings listed below and in the general "

Dialysis should be considered part of supportive care if the patient satisfies any of the following criteria: 1. Clinical criteria a. Potentially life-threatening toxicity that is caused by a dialyzable drug and cannot be treated by conservative means. b. Hypotension threatening renal or hepatic function that cannot be corrected by adjusting circulating volume. c. Marked hyperosmolality or severe acid–base or electrolyte disturbances not responding to therapy. d. Marked hypothermia or hyperthermia not responding to therapy. 2. Immediate dialysis—Immediate dialysis should be con- sidered in ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning only if acidosis is refractory, the patient does not respond to fomep- izole treatment, or blood levels of ethanol of 100 mg/dL are consistently maintained. Refractory salicylate intoxication may benefit from dialysis. MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC  COMMON POISONINGS ACETAMINOPHEN (PARACETAMOL) Overdosage of acetaminophen is the most common pediatric poisoning and can produce severe hepatotoxicity. The inci- dence of hepatotoxicity in adults and adolescents has been reported to be 10 times higher than in children younger than age 5 years. In the latter group, fewer than 0.1% develop hepatotoxicity after acetaminophen overdose. In children, toxicity most commonly results from repeated overdosage arising from confusion about the age-appropriate dose, use of multiple products that contain acetaminophen, or use of adult suppositories. Acetaminophen is normally metabolized in the liver. A small percentage of the drug goes through a pathway leading to a toxic metabolite. Normally, this electrophilic reactant is removed harmlessly by conjugation with glutathione. In over- dosage, the supply of glutathione becomes exhausted, and the metabolite may bind covalently to components of liver cells to produce necrosis. Some authors have proposed that therapeutic doses of acetaminophen may be toxic to children with depleted glutathione stores. However, there is no evidence that adminis- tration of therapeutic doses can cause toxicity, and only a few inadequate case reports have been made in this regard.  Treatment Treatment is to administer acetylcysteine. It may be admin- istered either orally or intravenously. Consultation on diffi- cult cases may be obtained from your regional poison con- trol center or the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center (1-800-525-6115). Blood levels should be obtained 4 hours after ingestion or as soon as possible thereafter and plotted on Figure 12–1. The nomogram is used only for acute ingestion, not repeated supratherapeutic ingestions. If the patient has ingested acetaminophen in a liquid preparation, blood levels obtained 2 hours after ingestion will accurately reflect the toxicity to be expected relative to the standard nomogram (see Figure 12–1). Acetylcysteine is administered to patients whose acetaminophen levels plot in the toxic range on the nomogram. Acetylcysteine is effective even when given more than 24 hours after ingestion, although it is most effective when given within 8 hours postingestion. The oral (PO) dose of acetylcysteine is 140 mg/kg, diluted to a 5% solution in sweet fruit juice or carbonated soft drink. The primary problems associated with administration are nausea and vomiting. After this loading dose, 70 mg/kg should be administered orally every 4 hours for 72 hours. For children weighing 40 kg or more, IV acetylcysteine (Acetadote) should be administered as a loading dose of 150 mg/kg administered over 15–60 minutes; followed by a second infusion of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, and then a third infusion of 100 mg/kg over 16 hours (a dosage calculator is available at http://www.acetadote.com) (Table 12–3).    CHAPTER 12 318 Gielen AC et al: Effects of improved access to safety counseling, products, and home visits on parents’ safety practices: Results of a randomized trial.

Significant abnormalities of liver function may not peak until 72–96 hours after ingestion. Repeated miscalculated overdoses given by parents to treat fever are the major source of toxicity in children younger than age 10 years, and parents are often unaware of the significance of symptoms of toxicity, thus delaying its prompt recognition and therapy.

341,"Alcohol, Ethyl (Ethanol)",Emergencies & Injuries ,1021,"ALCOHOL, ETHYL (ETHANOL) Alcoholic beverages, tinctures, cosmetics, mouthwashes, and rubbing alcohol are common sources of poisoning in chil- dren. Concomitant exposure to other depressant drugs increases the seriousness of the intoxication. In most states, alcohol levels of 50–80 mg/dL are considered compatible with impaired faculties, and levels of 80–100 mg/dL are considered evidence of intoxication. (Blood levels cited here are for adults; comparable figures for children are not available.) Recent erroneous information regarding hand sanitizers has indicated that a “lick” following application on the hand could cause toxicity in children. In fact this is not the case, but because these hand sanitizers contain 62% ethanol, toxicity following ingestion is very possible.

343,Amphetamines & Related Drugs,Emergencies & Injuries ,16,"AMPHETAMINES & RELATED  DRUGS (METHAMPHETAMINE)  Clinical Presentation A. Acute Poisoning Amphetamine and methamphetamine poisoning is common because of the widespread availability of “diet pills” and the use of “speed,” “crank,” “crystal,” and “ice” by adolescents. (Care must be taken in the interpretation of slang terms because they have multiple meanings.) A new cause of amphetamine poi- soning is drugs for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis- order, such as methylphenidate. Symptoms include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, anxiety, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, hypertension, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, and inability to void urine. Severe cases often include rhabdomyolysis. A toxic psychosis indistinguishable from paranoid schizophrenia may occur. Methamphetamine laboratories in homes are a potential cause of childhood exposure to a variety of hazardous and toxic substances. B. Chronic Poisoning Chronic amphetamine users develop tolerance; more than 1500 mg of IV methamphetamine can be used daily. Hyperac- tivity, disorganization, and euphoria are followed by exhaus- tion, depression, and coma lasting 2–3 days. Heavy users, taking more than 100 mg/d, have restlessness, incoordination of thought, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, and visual hallucinations. Psychosis may be precipitated by the chronic administration of high doses. Depression, weakness, tremors, GI complaints, and suicidal thoughts occur frequently.  Treatment The treatment of choice is diazepam, titrated in small incre- ments to effect. Very large total doses may be needed. In cases of extreme agitation or hallucinations, droperidol (0.1 mg/kg per dose) or haloperidol (up to 0.1 mg/kg) parenterally has been used. When combinations of amphetamines and barbi- turates (diet pills) are used, the action of the amphetamines begins first, followed by a depression caused by the barbitur- ates. In these cases, treatment with additional barbiturates is contraindicated because of the risk of respiratory failure. Chronic users may be withdrawn rapidly from ampheta- mines. If amphetamine–barbiturate combination tablets have been used, the barbiturates must be withdrawn gradu- ally to prevent withdrawal seizures. Psychiatric treatment should be provided.

ANESTHETICS, LOCAL Intoxication from local anesthetics may be associated with CNS stimulation, acidosis, delirium, ataxia, shock, convul- sions, and death. Methemoglobinuria has been reported following local dental analgesia. The maximum recom- mended dose for subcutaneous (SQ) infiltration is 4.5 mg/ kg. The temptation to exceed this dose in procedures lasting a long time is great and may result in inadvertent overdos- age. PO application of viscous lidocaine may produce toxic- ity. Hypercapnia may lower the seizure threshold to locally injected anesthetics. Local anesthetics used in obstetrics cross the placental barrier and are not efficiently metabolized by the fetal liver. Mepivacaine, lidocaine, and bupivacaine can cause fetal bradycardia, neonatal depression, and death. Prilocaine causes methemoglobinemia, which should be treated if levels in the blood exceed 40% or if the patient is symptomatic. Accidental injection of mepivacaine into the head of the fetus during paracervical anesthesia has caused neonatal asphyxia, cyanosis, acidosis, bradycardia, convulsions, and death.  Treatment If the anesthetic has been ingested, mucous membranes should be cleansed carefully and activated charcoal may be adminis- tered. Oxygen administration is indicated, with assisted venti- lation if necessary. Methemoglobinemia is treated with meth- ylene blue, 1%, 0.2 mL/kg (1– 2 mg/kg per dose, IV) over 5–10 minutes; this should promptly relieve the cyanosis. Acidosis may be treated with sodium bicarbonate, seizures with diaz- epam, and bradycardia with atropine. Therapeutic levels of mepivacaine, lidocaine, and procaine are less than 5 mg/mL.

ANTIHISTAMINES Although antihistamines typically cause CNS depression, chil- dren often react paradoxically with excitement, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, tremors, and convulsions followed by CNS depression, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular collapse. Anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushed face, fever, and hallucinations may be prominent. Antihistamines are widely available in allergy, sleep, cold, and antiemetic preparations, and many are supplied in sus- tained-release forms, which increase the likelihood of danger- ous overdoses. They are absorbed rapidly and metabolized by the liver, lungs, and kidneys. A potentially toxic dose is 10–50 mg/kg of the most commonly used antihistamines, but toxic reactions have occurred at much lower doses.  Treatment Activated charcoal should be used to reduce drug absorption. Whole bowel irrigation may be useful for sustained-release preparations.

Heavy users, taking more than 100 mg/d, have restlessness, incoordination of thought, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, and visual hallucinations. Psychosis may be precipitated by the chronic administration of high doses. Depression, weakness, tremors, GI complaints, and suicidal thoughts occur frequently.  Treatment The treatment of choice is diazepam, titrated in small incre- ments to effect. Very large total doses may be needed. In cases of extreme agitation or hallucinations, droperidol (0.1 mg/kg per dose) or haloperidol (up to 0.1 mg/kg) parenterally has been used. When combinations of amphetamines and barbi- turates (diet pills) are used, the action of the amphetamines begins first, followed by a depression caused by the barbitur- ates. In these cases, treatment with additional barbiturates is contraindicated because of the risk of respiratory failure. Chronic users may be withdrawn rapidly from ampheta- mines. If amphetamine–barbiturate combination tablets have been used, the barbiturates must be withdrawn gradu- ally to prevent withdrawal seizures. Psychiatric treatment should be provided.

Methemoglobinuria has been reported following local dental analgesia. The maximum recom- mended dose for subcutaneous (SQ) infiltration is 4.5 mg/ kg. The temptation to exceed this dose in procedures lasting a long time is great and may result in inadvertent overdos- age. PO application of viscous lidocaine may produce toxic- ity. Hypercapnia may lower the seizure threshold to locally injected anesthetics. Local anesthetics used in obstetrics cross the placental barrier and are not efficiently metabolized by the fetal liver. Mepivacaine, lidocaine, and bupivacaine can cause fetal bradycardia, neonatal depression, and death. Prilocaine causes methemoglobinemia, which should be treated if levels in the blood exceed 40% or if the patient is symptomatic. Accidental injection of mepivacaine into the head of the fetus during paracervical anesthesia has caused neonatal asphyxia, cyanosis, acidosis, bradycardia, convulsions, and death.  Treatment If the anesthetic has been ingested, mucous membranes should be cleansed carefully and activated charcoal may be adminis- tered. Oxygen administration is indicated, with assisted venti- lation if necessary. Methemoglobinemia is treated with meth- ylene blue, 1%, 0.2 mL/kg (1– 2 mg/kg per dose, IV) over 5–10 minutes; this should promptly relieve the cyanosis.

ANTIHISTAMINES Although antihistamines typically cause CNS depression, chil- dren often react paradoxically with excitement, hallucinations, delirium, ataxia, tremors, and convulsions followed by CNS depression, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular collapse. Anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushed face, fever, and hallucinations may be prominent. Antihistamines are widely available in allergy, sleep, cold, and antiemetic preparations, and many are supplied in sus- tained-release forms, which increase the likelihood of danger- ous overdoses. They are absorbed rapidly and metabolized by the liver, lungs, and kidneys.

Acute Poisoning Amphetamine and methamphetamine poisoning is common because of the widespread availability of “diet pills” and the use of “speed,” “crank,” “crystal,” and “ice” by adolescents. (Care must be taken in the interpretation of slang terms because they have multiple meanings.) A new cause of amphetamine poi- soning is drugs for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis- order, such as methylphenidate. Symptoms include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, anxiety, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, hypertension, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, and inability to void urine. Severe cases often include rhabdomyolysis. A toxic psychosis indistinguishable from paranoid schizophrenia may occur. Methamphetamine laboratories in homes are a potential cause of childhood exposure to a variety of hazardous and toxic substances. B.

344,Arsenic,Emergencies & Injuries ,360,"ARSENIC Arsenic is used in some insecticides (fruit tree or tobacco sprays), rodenticides, weed killers, and wood preservatives. It is well absorbed primarily through the GI and respiratory tracts, but skin absorption may occur. Arsenic can be found in the urine, hair, and nails by laboratory testing. Highly toxic soluble derivatives of this compound, such as sodium arsenite, are frequently found in liquid prepara- tions and can cause death in as many as 65% of victims. The organic arsenates found in persistent or preemergence weed killers are relatively less soluble and less toxic. Poisonings with a liquid arsenical preparation that does not contain alkyl methanearsonate compounds should be considered potentially lethal. Patients exhibiting clinical signs other than gastroenteritis should receive treatment until laboratory tests indicate that treatment is no longer necessary.  Clinical Findings A. Acute Poisoning Abdominal pain, vomiting, watery and bloody diarrhea, cardiovascular collapse, paresthesias, neck pain, and garlic odor on the breath occur as the first signs of acute poisoning. Convulsions, coma, anuria, and exfoliative dermatitis are later signs. Inhalation may cause pulmonary edema. Death is the result of cardiovascular collapse. B. Chronic Poisoning Anorexia, generalized weakness, giddiness, colic, abdominal pain, polyneuritis, dermatitis, nail changes, alopecia, and anemia often develop.  Treatment In acute poisoning administer activated charcoal. Then immediately give dimercaprol (commonly known as BAL), 3–5 mg/kg intramuscularly (IM), and follow with 2 mg/kg IM every 4 hours. The dimercaprol–arsenic complex is dialyz- able. A second choice is succimer. The initial dose is 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days. A third choice is penicillamine, 100 mg/kg PO to a maximum of 1 g/d in four divided doses. Chronic arsenic intoxication should be treated with succi- mer or penicillamine. Collect a 24-hour baseline urine speci- men and then begin chelation. If the 24-hour urine arsenic level is greater than 50 mg, continue chelation for 5 days. After 10 days, repeat the 5-day cycle once or twice, depending on how soon the urine arsenic level falls below 50 mg/24 h.

BARBITURATES The toxic effects of barbiturates include confusion, poor coordination, coma, miotic or fixed dilated pupils, and respiratory depression. Respiratory acidosis is commonly associated with pulmonary atelectasis, and hypotension occurs frequently in severely poisoned patients. Ingestion of more than 6 mg/kg of long-acting or 3 mg/kg of short-acting barbiturates is usually toxic.  Treatment Activated charcoal should be administered. Careful, conser- vative management with emphasis on maintaining a clear airway, adequate ventilation, and control of hypotension is critical. Urinary alkalinization and the use of multiple-dose charcoal may decrease the elimination half-life of phenobar- bital but have not been shown to alter the clinical course. Hemodialysis is not useful in the treatment of poisoning with short-acting barbiturates. Analeptics are contraindicated.

Onset of symptoms may be more rapid and more severe if the patient lives at a high altitude, has a high respiratory rate (ie, infants), is pregnant, or has myocardial insufficiency or lung disease. Normal blood may contain up to 5% carboxyhemoglobin (10% in smokers). The most prominent early symptom is headache. Other effects include confusion, unsteadiness, and coma. Pro- teinuria, glycosuria, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, or ECG changes may be present in the acute phase. Perma- nent cardiac, liver, renal, or CNS damage occurs occasion- ally. The outcome of severe poisoning may be complete recovery, vegetative state, or any degree of mental injury between these extremes. The primary mental deficits are neuropsychiatric.  Treatment The biologic half-life of carbon monoxide on room air is approximately 200–300 minutes; on 100% oxygen, it is 60– 90 minutes. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy at 2.0–2.5 atm of oxygen shortens the half-life to 30 minutes. After the level has been reduced to near zero, therapy is aimed at the nonspecific sequelae of anoxia. Dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg IV or IM every 4–6 hours) should be added if cerebral edema develops.

CAUSTICS 1. Acids (Hydrochloric, Hydrofluoric, Nitric,  & Sulfuric Acids; Sodium Bisulfate) Strong acids are commonly found in metal and toilet bowl cleaners, batteries, and other products. Hydrofluoric acid is the most toxic and hydrochloric acid the least toxic of these household substances. However, even a few drops can be fatal if aspirated into the trachea. Painful swallowing, mucous membrane burns, bloody emesis, abdominal pain, respiratory distress due to edema of the epiglottis, thirst, shock, and renal failure can occur. Coma and convulsions sometimes are seen terminally. Residual lesions include esophageal, gastric, and pyloric strictures as well as scars of the cornea, skin, and oropharynx. Hydrofluoric acid is a particularly dangerous poison. Dermal exposure creates a penetrating burn that can progress for hours or days. Large dermal exposure or inges- tion may produce life-threatening hypocalcemia abruptly as well as burn reactions.  Treatment Emetics and lavage are contraindicated. Water or milk (< 15 mL/kg) is used to dilute the acid, because a heat-producing chemical reaction does not occur. Take care not to induce emesis by excessive fluid administration. Alkalies should not be used. Burned areas of the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes should be washed with copious amounts of warm water. Opioids for pain may be needed. An endotracheal tube may be required to alleviate laryngeal edema. Esophagoscopy should be performed if the patient has significant burns or difficulty in swallowing. Acids are likely to produce gastric burns or esophageal burns. Evidence is not conclusive, but corticosteroids have not proved to be of use. Hydrofluoric acid burns on skin are treated with 10% calcium gluconate gel or calcium gluconate infusion. Severe exposure may require large doses of IV calcium. Therapy should be guided by calcium levels, the ECG, and clinical signs. 2. Bases (Clinitest Tablets, Clorox, Drano,  Liquid-Plumr, Purex, Sani-Clor—Examine the  Label or Call a Poison Center to Determine  Contents) Alkalies produce more severe injuries than acids. Some substances, such as Clinitest tablets or Drano, are quite toxic, whereas the chlorinated bleaches (3–6% solutions of sodium hypochlorite) are usually not toxic. When sodium hypochlo- rite comes in contact with acid in the stomach, hypochlorous acid, which is very irritating to the mucous membranes and skin, is formed. Rapid inactivation of this substance prevents systemic toxicity. Chlorinated bleaches, when mixed with a strong acid (toilet bowl cleaners) or ammonia, may produce irritating chlorine or chloramine gas, which can cause seri- ous lung injury if inhaled in a closed space (eg, bathroom). Alkalies can burn the skin, mucous membranes, and eyes. Respiratory distress may be due to edema of the epiglottis, pulmonary edema resulting from inhalation of fumes, or pneu- monia. Mediastinitis or other intercurrent infections or shock can occur. Perforation of the esophagus or stomach is rare.  Treatment The skin and mucous membranes should be cleansed with copious amounts of water. A local anesthetic can be instilled in the eye if necessary to alleviate blepharospasm. The eye should be irrigated for at least 20–30 minutes. Ophthalmologic con- sultation should be obtained for all alkaline eye burns. Ingestions should be treated with water as a diluent. Routine esophagoscopy is no longer indicated to rule out burns of the esophagus due to chlorinated bleaches unless an unusually large amount has been ingested or the patient is symptomatic. The absence of oral lesions does not rule out the possibility of laryngeal or esophageal burns following granular alkali ingestion.

A local anesthetic can be instilled in the eye if necessary to alleviate blepharospasm. The eye should be irrigated for at least 20–30 minutes. Ophthalmologic con- sultation should be obtained for all alkaline eye burns. Ingestions should be treated with water as a diluent. Routine esophagoscopy is no longer indicated to rule out burns of the esophagus due to chlorinated bleaches unless an unusually large amount has been ingested or the patient is symptomatic. The absence of oral lesions does not rule out the possibility of laryngeal or esophageal burns following granular alkali ingestion. The use of corticosteroids is con- troversial, but has not been shown to improve long-term   CHAPTER 12 324 outcome except possibly in partial-thickness esophageal burns. Antibiotics may be needed if mediastinitis is likely, but they should not be used prophylactically. (See Caustic Burns of the Esophagus section in Chapter 20.)

346,Cocaine,Poisoning ,684,"COCAINE Cocaine is absorbed intranasally or via inhalation or inges- tion. Effects are noted almost immediately when the drug is taken intravenously or smoked. Peak effects are delayed for about an hour when the drug is taken orally or nasally. Cocaine prevents the reuptake of endogenous catechol- amines, thereby causing an initial sympathetic discharge, followed by catechol depletion after chronic abuse.  Clinical Findings A local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor, cocaine is also a potent stimulant to both the CNS and the cardiovascular system. The initial tachycardia, hyperpnea, hypertension, and stimulation of the CNS are often followed by coma, seizures, hypotension, and respiratory depression. In severe cases of overdose, various dysrhythmias may be seen, includ- ing sinus tachycardia, atrial arrhythmias, premature ventric- ular contractions, bigeminy, and ventricular fibrillation. If large doses are taken intravenously, cardiac failure, dysrhyth- mias, rhabdomyolysis, or hyperthermia may result in death. In addition to those poisoned through recreational use of cocaine, others are at risk of overdose. A “body stuffer” is one who quickly ingests the drug, usually poorly wrapped, to avoid discovery. A “body packer” wraps the drug carefully for prolonged transport. A stuffer typically manifests toxicity within hours of ingestion; a packer is asymptomatic unless the package ruptures, usually days later.  Treatment Except in cases of body stuffers or body packers, decontami- nation is seldom possible. Activated charcoal should be administered, and whole bowel irrigation may be useful in selected cases. Testing for cocaine in blood or plasma is generally not clinically useful, but a qualitative analysis of the urine may aid in confirming the diagnosis. For severe cases, an ECG is indicated. In suspected cases of body packing, radiographs of the GI tract may show multiple packets. Radiographic films are usually not helpful for identifying stuffers. Seizures are treated with IV diazepam titrated to response. Hypotension is treated with standard agents. Because cocaine abuse may deplete norepinephrine, an indi- rect agent such as dopamine may be less effective than a direct agent such as norepinephrine. Agitation is best treated with a benzodiazepine. Delaney-Black V: Prenatal cocaine exposure as a risk factor for later developmental outcomes. JAMA 2001;286:46 [PMID: 11434823].

COSMETICS & RELATED PRODUCTS The relative toxicities of commonly ingested products in this group are listed in Table 12–5. Permanent wave neutralizers may contain bromates, peroxides, or perborates. Bromates have been removed from most products because they can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shock, hemolysis, renal failure, and convulsions. Perborates can cause boric acid poisoning. Four grams of bromate salts is potentially lethal. Poisoning is treated by gastric lavage with 1% sodium thio- sulfate. Sodium bicarbonate, 2%, in the lavage fluid may reduce hydrobromic acid formation. Sodium thiosulfate, 25%, 1.65 mL/kg, can be given intravenously, but methylene blue should not be used to treat methemoglobinemia in this situation because it increases the toxicity of bromates.

Cobalt, copper, cadmium, iron, lead, nickel, silver, bis- muth, and tin are sometimes found in metallic hair dyes. In large amounts they can cause skin sensitization, urticaria, dermatitis, eye damage, vertigo, hypertension, asthma, met- hemoglobinemia, tremors, convulsions, and coma. Treat- ment for ingestions is to administer demulcents and, only with large amounts, the appropriate antidote for the heavy metal involved. Home permanent wave lotions, hair straighteners, and hair removers usually contain thioglycolic acid salts, which cause alkaline irritation and perhaps CNS depression. Shaving lotion, hair tonic, hair straighteners, cologne, and toilet water contain denatured alcohol, which can cause CNS depression and hypoglycemia. Deodorants usually consist of an antibacterial agent in a cream base. Antiperspirants are aluminum salts, which fre- quently cause skin sensitization. Zirconium oxide can cause granulomas in the axilla with chronic use. "
347,Cyclic Antidepressants,Poisoning ,1145,"CYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS Cyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline, imipramine) have a very low ratio of toxic to therapeutic doses, and even a moderate overdose can have serious effects. Cyclic antidepressant overdosage causes dysrhythmias, coma, convulsions, hypertension followed by hypotension, and hallucinations. These effects may be life-threatening and require rapid intervention. One agent, amoxapine, differs in that it causes fewer cardiovascular complications, but it is associated with a higher incidence of seizures.  Treatment Decontamination should include administration of activated charcoal unless the patient is symptomatic. An ECG should be obtained in all patients. A QRS interval greater than 100 ms specifically identifies patients at risk to develop dysrhythmias. If dysrhythmias are demon- strated, the patient should be admitted and monitored until free of irregularity for 24 hours. Another indication for monitoring is persistent tachycardia of more than 110 beats/ min. The onset of dysrhythmias is rare beyond 24 hours after ingestion. Alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (0.5–1.0 mEq/kg IV) or hyperventilation may dramatically reverse ventricular dysrhythmias and narrow the QRS interval. Lidocaine may be added for treatment of arrhythmias. Bolus administration of sodium bicarbonate is recommended for all patients with QRS widening to above 120 ms and for those with significant dys- rhythmias, to achieve a pH of 7.5–7.6. Forced diuresis is contra- indicated. A benzodiazepine should be given for convulsions. Hypotension is a major problem. Cyclic antidepressants block the reuptake of catecholamines, thereby producing initial hypertension followed by hypotension. Treatment with physostigmine is contraindicated. Vasopressors are generally effective. Dopamine is the agent of choice because it is readily available. If dopamine is ineffective, norepineph- rine (0.1–1 μg/kg/min, titrated to response) should be added. Diuresis and hemodialysis are not effective.

DIGITALIS & OTHER CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES Toxicity is typically the result of incorrect dosing or unrec- ognized renal insufficiency. Clinical features include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, delirium, confusion, and, occasionally, coma. Cardiac dysrhythmias typically involve bradydysrhythmias, but every type of dysrhythmia has been reported in digitalis intoxication, including atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter. Death usu- ally is the result of ventricular fibrillation. Transplacental intoxication by digitalis has been reported.  Treatment Administer activated charcoal. Potassium is contraindicated in acute overdosage unless there is laboratory evidence of hypokalemia. In acute overdosage, hyperkalemia is more common. Hypokalemia is common in chronic toxicity. The patient must be monitored carefully for ECG changes. The correction of acidosis better demonstrates the degree of potassium deficiency present. Bradycardias have been treated with atropine. Phenytoin, lidocaine, magne- sium salts (not in renal failure), amiodarone, and bretylium have been used to correct arrhythmias. Definitive treatment is with digoxin immune Fab (ovine) (Digibind).

348,Disinfectants & Deodorizers,Poisoning ,847,"DISINFECTANTS & DEODORIZERS 1. Naphthalene Naphthalene is commonly found in mothballs, disinfectants, and deodorizers. Naphthalene’s toxicity is often not fully appreciated. It is absorbed not only when ingested but also through the skin and lungs. It is potentially hazardous to store baby clothes in naphthalene, because baby oil is an excellent solvent that may increase dermal absorption. Note: Most mothballs contain para-dichlorobenzene and not naphthalene (see next section). Metabolic products of naph- thalene may cause severe hemolytic anemia, similar to that due to primaquine toxicity, 2–7 days after ingestion. Other physical findings include vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, oligu- ria, anuria, coma, and convulsions. The urine may contain hemoglobin, protein, and casts.  Treatment Administer activated charcoal. Urinary alkalinization may prevent blocking of the renal tubules by acid hematin crys- tals. Anuria may persist for 1–2 weeks and still be completely reversible. Siegel E, Wason S: Mothball toxicity. Pediatr Clin North Am 1986;33:369 [PMID: 3515301]. 2. P-Dichlorobenzene,  Phenolic Acids, & Others Disinfectants and deodorizers containing p-dichloroben- zene or sodium sulfate are much less toxic than those containing naphthalene. Disinfectants containing phenolic acids are highly toxic, especially if they contain a borate ion. Phenol precipitates tissue proteins and causes respiratory alkalosis followed by metabolic acidosis. Some phenols cause methemoglobinemia. Local gangrene occurs after prolonged contact with tis- sue. Phenol is readily absorbed from the GI tract, causing diffuse capillary damage and, in some cases, methemoglo- binemia. Pentachlorophenol, which has been used in termi- nal rinsing of diapers, has caused infant fatalities. The toxicity of alkalies, quaternary ammonium com- pounds, pine oil, and halogenated disinfectants varies with the concentration of active ingredients. Wick deodorizers are usually of moderate toxicity. Iodophor disinfectants are the safest. Spray deodorizers are not usually toxic, because a child is not likely to swallow a very large dose. Signs and symptoms of acute quaternary ammonium compound ingestion include diaphoresis, strong irritation, thirst, vomiting, diarrhea, cyanosis, hyperactivity, coma, convulsions, hypotension, abdominal pain, and pulmonary edema. Acute liver or renal failure may develop later.  Treatment Activated charcoal may be used. Castor oil dissolves phenol and may retard its absorption. This property of castor oil, however, has not been proved clinically. Mineral oil and alcohol are contraindicated because they increase the gastric absorption of phenol. The metabolic acidosis must be man- aged carefully. Anticonvulsants or measures to treat shock may be needed. Because phenols are absorbed through the skin, exposed areas should be irrigated copiously with water. Undiluted polyethylene glycol may be a useful solvent as well.

DISK-SHAPED BATTERIES Small, flat, smooth disk-shaped batteries measure between 10 and 25 mm in diameter. About 69% of them pass through the GI tract in 48 hours and 85% in 72 hours. Some may become entrapped. These batteries contain caustic materials and heavy metals. Batteries impacted in the esophagus may cause symptoms of refusal to take food, increased salivation, vomiting with or without blood, and pain or discomfort. Aspiration into the trachea may also occur. Fatalities have been reported in association with esophageal perforation. When a history of disk battery ingestion is obtained, radiographs of the entire respiratory tract and GI tract should be taken so that the battery can be located and the proper therapy determined.  Treatment If the disk battery is located in the esophagus, it must be removed immediately. If the battery has been in the esopha- gus for more than 24 hours, the risk of caustic burn is greater.   CHAPTER 12 326 dren younger than age 2 years. Early signs of intoxication with this preparation result from its anticholinergic effect and consist of fever, facial flushing, tachypnea, and leth- argy. However, the miotic effect of the narcotic predomi- nates. Later, hypothermia, increasing CNS depression, and loss of the facial flush occur. Seizures are probably second- ary to hypoxia.  Treatment Prolonged monitoring (24 hours) with pulse oximetry and careful attention to airway is sufficient in most cases. Naloxone hydrochloride (0.4–2.0 mg IV in children and adults) should be given. Repeated doses may be required because the duration of action of diphenoxylate is consider- ably longer than that of naloxone.

Naphthalene Naphthalene is commonly found in mothballs, disinfectants, and deodorizers. Naphthalene’s toxicity is often not fully appreciated. It is absorbed not only when ingested but also through the skin and lungs. It is potentially hazardous to store baby clothes in naphthalene, because baby oil is an excellent solvent that may increase dermal absorption. Note: Most mothballs contain para-dichlorobenzene and not naphthalene (see next section). Metabolic products of naph- thalene may cause severe hemolytic anemia, similar to that due to primaquine toxicity, 2–7 days after ingestion. Other physical findings include vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, oligu- ria, anuria, coma, and convulsions. The urine may contain hemoglobin, protein, and casts.  Treatment Administer activated charcoal. Urinary alkalinization may prevent blocking of the renal tubules by acid hematin crys- tals. Anuria may persist for 1–2 weeks and still be completely reversible. Siegel E, Wason S: Mothball toxicity. Pediatr Clin North Am 1986;33:369 [PMID: 3515301]. 2. P-Dichlorobenzene,  Phenolic Acids, & Others Disinfectants and deodorizers containing p-dichloroben- zene or sodium sulfate are much less toxic than those containing naphthalene. Disinfectants containing phenolic acids are highly toxic, especially if they contain a borate ion. Phenol precipitates tissue proteins and causes respiratory alkalosis followed by metabolic acidosis. Some phenols cause methemoglobinemia. Local gangrene occurs after prolonged contact with tis- sue. Phenol is readily absorbed from the GI tract, causing diffuse capillary damage and, in some cases, methemoglo- binemia.

Perforated Meckel diverticulum has been the major complication. It may take as long as 7 days for sponta- neous passage to occur, and lack of movement in the GI tract may not require removal in an asymptomatic patient. Some researchers have suggested repeated radiographs and surgical intervention if passage of the battery pauses, but this approach may be excessive. Batteries that have opened in the GI tract have been associated with some toxicity due to mercury, but the patients have recovered. Emesis is ineffective. Asymptomatic patients may simply be observed and stools examined for passage of the battery. If the battery has not passed within 7 days or if the patient becomes symptomatic, radiographs should be repeated. If the battery has come apart or appears not to be moving, a purgative, enema, or nonabsorbable intestinal lavage solu- tion should be administered. If these methods are unsuccess- ful, surgical intervention may be required. Levels of heavy metals (mainly mercury) should be measured in patients in whom the battery has opened or symptoms have developed. Dane S: A truly emergent problem: Button battery in the nose.

349,Ethylene Glycol & Methanol,Poisoning ,1476,"ETHYLENE GLYCOL & METHANOL Ethylene glycol and methanol are the toxic alcohols. The primary source of ethylene glycol is antifreeze, whereas methanol is present in windshield wiper fluid and also as an ethanol denaturant. Ethylene glycol causes severe metabolic acidosis and renal failure. Methanol causes metabolic acido- sis and blindness. Onset of symptoms with both agents occurs within several hours after ingestion, longer if ethanol was ingested simultaneously.  Treatment The primary treatment is to block the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which converts both agents to their toxic metabolites. This is accomplished with fomepizole (loading dose of 15 mg/kg) or ethanol. Fomepizole is preferred for children, due to its reduced side effects in this age group.

GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE,  GAMMA-BUTYROLACTONE, & BUTANEDIOL Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), and butanediol have become popular drugs of abuse in adoles- cents and adults. GHB is a CNS depressant that is structurally similar to the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid. GBL and butanediol are converted in the body to GHB. These drugs cause deep but short-lived coma; the coma often lasts only 1–4 hours. Treatment consists of supportive care with close attention to airway and endotracheal intubation if respiratory depression or decreased gag reflex complicates the poisoning. Atropine has been used successfully for sympto- matic bradycardia. Withdrawal from GHB, GBL, or butanediol can cause several days of extreme agitation, hallucination, or tachycar- dia. Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines or with butyrophenones (eg, haloperidol or droperidol) or secobar- bital may be needed for several days.

HYDROCARBONS (BENZENE, CHARCOAL  LIGHTER FLUID, GASOLINE, KEROSENE,  PETROLEUM DISTILLATES, TURPENTINE) Ingestion of hydrocarbons may cause irritation of mucous membranes, vomiting, blood-tinged diarrhea, respiratory distress, cyanosis, tachycardia, and fever. Although a small amount (10 mL) of certain hydrocarbons is potentially fatal, patients have survived ingestion of several ounces of other petroleum distillates. The more aromatic a hydrocarbon is and the lower its viscosity rating, the more potentially toxic it is. Benzene, gasoline, kerosene, and red seal oil furniture polish are the most dangerous. A dose exceeding 1 mL/kg is likely to cause CNS depression. A history of coughing or choking, as well as vomiting, suggests aspiration with result- ing hydrocarbon pneumonia. This is an acute hemorrhagic necrotizing disease that usually develops within 24 hours of the ingestion and resolves without sequelae in 3–5 days. However, several weeks may be required for full resolution of hydrocarbon pneumonia. Pneumonia may be caused by the aspiration of a few drops of petroleum distillate into the lung or by absorption from the circulatory system. Pulmo- nary edema and hemorrhage, cardiac dilation and dysrhyth- mias, hepatosplenomegaly, proteinuria, and hematuria can occur following large overdoses. Hypoglycemia is occasion- ally present. A chest radiograph may reveal pneumonia within hours after the ingestion. An abnormal urinalysis in a child with a previously normal urinary tract suggests a large overdose.  Treatment Both emetics and lavage should be avoided. Mineral oil should not be given, because it can cause a low-grade lipoid pneumonia.   POISONING 327 Location of the disk battery below the esophagus has been associated with tissue damage, but the course is benign in most cases.

In rare cases, apnea (especially in young children), seizures, metabolic acidosis, and CNS depression leading to coma have occurred.  Treatment If a child has ingested less than 100 mg/kg, dilution with water or milk may be all that is necessary to minimize the GI upset. In children, the volume of liquid used for dilution should be less than 4 oz. When the ingested amount is more than 400 mg/kg, seizures or CNS depression may occur; therefore, gastric lavage may be preferred to emesis. Acti- vated charcoal may also be of value.

INSECT STINGS (BEE, WASP, & HORNET) Insect stings are painful but not usually dangerous; however, death from anaphylaxis may occur. Bee venom has hemolytic, neurotoxic, and histamine-like activities that can on rare occasion cause hemoglobinuria and severe anaphy- lactoid reactions. Massive envenomation from numerous stings may cause hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, and shock leading to multiple organ failure.  Treatment The physician should remove the stinger, taking care not to squeeze the attached venom sac. For allergic reactions, epi- nephrine 1:1000 solution, 0.01 mL/kg, should be adminis- tered IV or SQ above the site of the sting. Three to four whiffs from an isoproterenol aerosol inhaler may be given at 3- to 4-minute intervals as needed. Corticosteroids (hydro- cortisone; 100 mg IV) and diphenhydramine (1.5 mg/kg IV) are useful ancillary drugs but have no immediate effect. Ephedrine or antihistamines may be used for 2 or 3 days to prevent recurrence of symptoms. A patient who has had a potentially life-threatening insect sting should be desensitized against the Hymenoptera group, because the honey bee, wasp, hornet, and yellow jacket have common antigens in their venom. For the more usual stings, cold compresses, aspirin, and diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg PO) are sufficient.

For allergic reactions, epi- nephrine 1:1000 solution, 0.01 mL/kg, should be adminis- tered IV or SQ above the site of the sting. Three to four whiffs from an isoproterenol aerosol inhaler may be given at 3- to 4-minute intervals as needed. Corticosteroids (hydro- cortisone; 100 mg IV) and diphenhydramine (1.5 mg/kg IV) are useful ancillary drugs but have no immediate effect. Ephedrine or antihistamines may be used for 2 or 3 days to prevent recurrence of symptoms. A patient who has had a potentially life-threatening insect sting should be desensitized against the Hymenoptera group, because the honey bee, wasp, hornet, and yellow jacket have common antigens in their venom. For the more usual stings, cold compresses, aspirin, and diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg PO) are sufficient.

350,Insecticides,Poisoning ,3318,"INSECTICIDES The petroleum distillates or other organic solvents used in these products are often as toxic as the insecticide itself. Decontamination may be performed by aspirating the stom- ach with a nasogastric tube. 1. Chlorinated Hydrocarbons (eg, Aldrin,  Carbinol, Chlordane, DDT, Dieldrin, Endrin,  Heptachlor, Lindane, Toxaphene) Signs of intoxication include salivation, GI irritability, abdom- inal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, CNS depression, and convul- sions. Inhalation exposure causes irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat; blurred vision; cough; and pulmonary edema. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are absorbed through the skin, respiratory tract, and GI tract. Decontamination of skin with soap and evacuation of the stomach contents are critical. All contaminated clothing should be removed. Castor oil, milk, and other substances containing fats or oils should not be left in the stomach because they increase absorption of the chlori- nated hydrocarbons. Convulsions should be treated with diaz- epam (0.1–0.3 mg/kg IV). Epinephrine should not be used because it may cause cardiac arrhythmias. 2. Organophosphate (Cholinesterase- Inhibiting) Insecticides (eg, Chlorothion,  Co-Ral, DFP, Diazinon, Malathion, Paraoxon,  Parathion, Phosdrin, TEPP, Thio-TEPP) Dizziness, headache, blurred vision, miosis, tearing, saliva- tion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, cyanosis, sense of constriction of the chest, dyspnea, sweating, weak- ness, muscular twitching, convulsions, loss of reflexes and sphincter control, and coma can occur. The clinical findings are the result of cholinesterase inhibition, which causes an accumulation of acetylcholine.   POISONING 329 The onset of symptoms occurs within 12 hours of the exposure. Red cell cholinesterase levels should be measured as soon as possible. (Some normal individuals have a low serum cholinesterase level.) Normal values vary in different laboratories. In general, a decrease of red cell cholinesterase to below 25% of normal indicates significant exposure. Repeated low-grade exposure may result in sudden, acute toxic reactions. This syndrome usually occurs after repeated household spraying rather than agricultural exposure. Although all organophosphates act by inhibiting cholin- esterase activity, they vary greatly in their toxicity. Parathion, for example, is 100 times more toxic than Malathion. Toxic- ity is influenced by the specific compound, type of formula- tion (liquid or solid), vehicle, and route of absorption (lungs, skin, or GI tract).  Treatment Decontamination of skin, nails, hair, and clothing with soapy water is extremely important. Atropine plus a cholinesterase reactivator, pralidoxime, is an antidote for organophosphate insecticide poisoning. After assessment and management of the ABCs, atropine should be given and repeated every few minutes until airway secretions diminish. An appropriate starting dose of atropine is 2–4 mg IV in an adult and 0.05 mg/kg in a child. The patient should receive enough atropine to stop secretions (mydriasis in not an appropriate stopping point). Severe poisoning may require gram quantities of atropine administered over 24 hours. Because atropine antagonizes the muscarinic parasympa- thetic effects of the organophosphates but does not affect the nicotinic receptor, it does not improve muscular weakness. Pralidoxime should also be given immediately in more severe cases and repeated every 6–12 hours as needed (25–50 mg/kg diluted to 5% and infused over 5–30 minutes at a rate of no more than 500 mg/min). Pralidoxime should be used in addition to—not in place of—atropine if red cell cholin- esterase is less than 25% of normal. Pralidoxime is most useful within 48 hours after the exposure but has shown some effects 2–6 days later. Morphine, theophylline, ami- nophylline, succinylcholine, and tranquilizers of the reserpine and phenothiazine types are contraindicated. Hyperglycemia is common in severe poisonings. Eisenstein EM, Amitai Y: Index of suspicion: Case 1. Organophos- phate intoxication. Pediatr Rev 2000;21:205 [PMID: 10854316]. 3. Carbamates (eg, Carbaryl, Sevin, Zectran) Carbamate insecticides are reversible inhibitors of cholines- terase. The signs and symptoms of intoxication are similar to those associated with organophosphate poisoning but are generally less severe. Atropine titrated to effect is sufficient treatment. Pralidoxime should not be used with carbaryl poisoning but is of value with other carbamates. In com- bined exposures to organophosphates, give atropine but reserve pralidoxime for cases in which the red cell cholines- terase is depressed below 25% of normal or marked effects of nicotinic receptor stimulation are present. 4. Botanical Insecticides (eg, Black  Flag Bug Killer, Black Leaf CPR Insect  Killer, Flit Aerosol House & Garden Insect  Killer, French’s Flea Powder, Raid) Allergic reactions, asthma-like symptoms, coma, and con- vulsions have been reported. Pyrethrins, allethrin, and rote- none do not commonly cause signs of toxicity. Antihista- mines, short-acting barbiturates, and atropine are helpful as symptomatic treatment. "
351,Iron,Poisoning ,3472,"IRON Five stages of intoxication may occur in iron poisoning: (1) Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, which occurs 30–60 min- utes after ingestion and may be associated with shock, acido- sis, coagulation defects, and coma. This phase usually lasts 4– 6 hours. (2) Phase of improvement, lasting 2–12 hours, during which patient looks better. (3) Delayed shock, which may occur 12–48 hours after ingestion. Metabolic acidosis, fever, leukocytosis, and coma may also be present. (4) Liver damage with hepatic failure. (5) Residual pyloric stenosis, which may develop about 4 weeks after the ingestion. Once iron is absorbed from the GI tract, it is not nor- mally eliminated in feces but may be partially excreted in the urine, giving it a red color prior to chelation. A reddish discoloration of the urine suggests a serum iron level greater than 350 mg/dL.  Treatment GI decontamination is based on clinical assessment. The patient should be referred to a health care facility if sympto- matic or if the history indicates toxic amounts. Gastric lavage and whole bowel irrigation should be considered in these patients. Shock is treated in the usual manner. Sodium bicarbo- nate and Fleet Phospho-Soda left in the stomach to form the insoluble phosphate or carbonate have not shown clinical benefit and have caused lethal hypernatremia or hyperphos- phatemia. Deferoxamine, a specific chelating agent for iron, is a useful adjunct in the treatment of severe iron poisoning. It forms a soluble complex that is excreted in the urine. It is contraindicated in patients with renal failure unless dialysis can be used. IV deferoxamine chelation therapy should be instituted if the patient is symptomatic and a serum iron determination cannot be obtained readily, or if the peak serum iron exceeds 400 mcg/dL (62.6 μmol/L) at 4–5 hours after ingestion. Deferoxamine should not be delayed until serum iron levels are available in serious cases of poisoning. IV administra- tion is indicated if the patient is in shock, in which case it   CHAPTER 12 330 should be given at a dosage of 15 mg/kg/h. Infusion rates up to 35 mg/kg/h have been used in life-threatening poisonings. Rapid IV administration can cause hypotension, facial flush- ing, urticaria, tachycardia, and shock. Deferoxamine, 90 mg/kg IM every 8 hours (maximum, 1 g), may be given if IV access cannot be established, but the procedure is painful. The indi- cations for discontinuation of deferoxamine have not been clearly delineated. Generally, it can be stopped after 12–24 hours if the acidosis has resolved and the patient is improving. Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or exchange transfu- sion can be used to increase the excretion of the dialyzable complex. Urine output should be monitored and urine sediment examined for evidence of renal tubular damage. Initial laboratory studies should include blood typing and cross-matching; total protein; serum iron, sodium, potas- sium, and chloride; PCO2; pH; and liver function tests. Serum iron levels fall rapidly even if deferoxamine is not given. After the acute episode, liver function studies and an upper GI series are indicated to rule out residual damage.

352,Lead,Poisoning ,1422,"LEAD Lead poisoning (plumbism) causes vague symptoms, includ- ing weakness, irritability, weight loss, vomiting, personality changes, ataxia, constipation, headache, and colicky abdom- inal pain. Late manifestations consist of retarded develop- ment, convulsions, and coma associated with increased intracranial pressure, which is a medical emergency. Plumbism usually occurs insidiously in children younger than age 5 years. The most likely sources of lead include flaking leaded paint, artist’s paints, fruit tree sprays, solder, brass alloys, home-glazed pottery, and fumes from burning batteries. Only paint containing less than 1% lead is safe for interior use (eg, furniture, toys). Repetitive ingestions of small amounts of lead are far more serious than a single massive exposure. Toxic effects are likely to occur if more than 0.5 mg of lead per day is absorbed. Blood lead levels are used to assess the severity of exposure. A complete blood count and serum ferritin concentration should be obtained; iron-deficiency increases absorption of lead. Glycosuria, proteinuria, hematuria, and aminoaciduria occur frequently. Blood lead levels usually exceed 80 mcg/dL in symptomatic patients. Abnormal blood lead levels should be repeated in asymptomatic patients to rule out laboratory error. Specimens must be meticulously obtained in acid- washed containers. A normocytic, slightly hypochromic ane- mia with basophilic stippling of the red cells and reticulocyto- sis may be present in plumbism. Stippling of red blood cells is absent in cases involving only recent ingestion. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein is elevated, and the white cell count usually is less than 100 cells/mL. CSF pressure may be elevated in patients with encephalopathy; lumbar punctures must be performed cautiously to prevent herniation.  Treatment Succimer is an orally administered chelator approved for use in children and reported to be as efficacious as calcium edetate. Treatment for blood lead levels of 20–45 mcg/dL in children has not been determined. Succimer should be initiated at blood lead levels over 45 mcg/dL. The initial dose is 10 mg/kg (350 mg/m2) every 8 hours for 5 days. The same dose is then given every 12 hours for 14 days. At least 2 weeks should elapse between courses. Blood lead levels increase somewhat (ie, rebound) after discontinuation of therapy. Courses of dimercaprol (4 mg/kg per dose) and calcium edetate may still be used but are no longer the preferred method, except in cases of lead encephalopathy. Anticonvulsants may be needed. Mannitol or corticoster- oids and volume restriction are indicated in patients with encephalopathy. A high-calcium, high-phosphorus diet and large doses of vitamin D may remove lead from the blood by depositing it in the bones. A public health team should evaluate the source of the lead.

Nitrite and nitrate compounds found in the home include amyl nitrite, butyl nitrates, isobutyl nitrates, nitroglycerin, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, sodium nitrite, nitrobenzene, and phenazopyridine. Pentachlorophenol and dinitrophenol, which are found in wood preservatives, produce methemo- globinemia and high fever because of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Headache, dizziness, and bradycardia have been reported. High concentrations of nitrites in well water or spinach have been the most common cause of nitrite- induced methemoglobinemia. Symptoms do not usually occur until 15–50% of the hemoglobin has been converted to methemoglobin. A rapid test is to compare a drop of normal blood with the patient’s blood on a dry filter paper. Brown discoloration of the patient’s blood indicates a methemoglo- bin level of more than 15%.  Treatment Administer activated charcoal. Decontaminate affected skin with soap and water. Oxygen and artificial respiration may be needed. If the blood methemoglobin level exceeds 30%, or if levels cannot be obtained and the patient is sympto- matic, give a 1% solution of methylene blue (0.2 mL/kg IV) over 5–10 minutes. Avoid perivascular infiltration, because it causes necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. A dramatic change in the degree of cyanosis should occur. Transfusion is occasionally necessary.

OPIOIDS (CODEINE, HEROIN, METHADONE,  MORPHINE, PROPOXYPHENE) Opioid-related medical problems may include drug addic- tion, withdrawal in a newborn infant, and accidental over- doses. Unlike other narcotics, methadone is absorbed readily from the GI tract. Most opioids, including heroin, metha- done, meperidine, morphine, and codeine, are excreted in the urine within 24 hours and can be detected readily. Narcotic-addicted adolescents often have other medical problems, including cellulitis, abscesses, thrombophlebitis, tetanus, infective endocarditis, HIV infection, tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, foreign body emboli, thrombosis of pul- monary arterioles, diabetes mellitus, obstetric complications, nephropathy, and peptic ulcer.  Treatment A. Overdose Opioids can cause respiratory depression, stridor, coma, increased oropharyngeal secretions, sinus bradycardia, and urinary retention. Pulmonary edema rarely occurs in chil- dren; deaths usually result from aspiration of gastric con- tents, respiratory arrest, and cerebral edema. Convulsions may occur with propoxyphene overdosage.

NITRITES, NITRATES, ANILINE,  PENTACHLOROPHENOL, & DINITROPHENOL Nausea, vertigo, vomiting, cyanosis (methemoglobinemia), cramping abdominal pain, tachycardia, cardiovascular col- lapse, tachypnea, coma, shock, convulsions, and death are possible manifestations of nitrite or nitrate poisoning. Nitrite and nitrate compounds found in the home include amyl nitrite, butyl nitrates, isobutyl nitrates, nitroglycerin, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, sodium nitrite, nitrobenzene, and phenazopyridine. Pentachlorophenol and dinitrophenol, which are found in wood preservatives, produce methemo- globinemia and high fever because of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Headache, dizziness, and bradycardia have been reported. High concentrations of nitrites in well water or spinach have been the most common cause of nitrite- induced methemoglobinemia. Symptoms do not usually occur until 15–50% of the hemoglobin has been converted to methemoglobin. A rapid test is to compare a drop of normal blood with the patient’s blood on a dry filter paper. Brown discoloration of the patient’s blood indicates a methemoglo- bin level of more than 15%.  Treatment Administer activated charcoal. Decontaminate affected skin with soap and water. Oxygen and artificial respiration may be needed. If the blood methemoglobin level exceeds 30%, or if levels cannot be obtained and the patient is sympto- matic, give a 1% solution of methylene blue (0.2 mL/kg IV) over 5–10 minutes. Avoid perivascular infiltration, because it causes necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. A dramatic change in the degree of cyanosis should occur. Transfusion is occasionally necessary. Epinephrine and other vasoconstrictors are contraindicated. If reflex bradycardia occurs, atropine should be used. Kennedy N et al: Faulty sausage production causing methaemo- globinaemia.

353,"Opioids (Codeine, Heroin, Methadone,  Morphine, Propoxyphene)",Poisoning ,3880,"OPIOIDS (CODEINE, HEROIN, METHADONE,  MORPHINE, PROPOXYPHENE) Opioid-related medical problems may include drug addic- tion, withdrawal in a newborn infant, and accidental over- doses. Unlike other narcotics, methadone is absorbed readily from the GI tract. Most opioids, including heroin, metha- done, meperidine, morphine, and codeine, are excreted in the urine within 24 hours and can be detected readily. Narcotic-addicted adolescents often have other medical problems, including cellulitis, abscesses, thrombophlebitis, tetanus, infective endocarditis, HIV infection, tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, foreign body emboli, thrombosis of pul- monary arterioles, diabetes mellitus, obstetric complications, nephropathy, and peptic ulcer.  Treatment A. Overdose Opioids can cause respiratory depression, stridor, coma, increased oropharyngeal secretions, sinus bradycardia, and urinary retention. Pulmonary edema rarely occurs in chil- dren; deaths usually result from aspiration of gastric con- tents, respiratory arrest, and cerebral edema. Convulsions may occur with propoxyphene overdosage. Although suggested doses for naloxone hydrochloride range from 0.01–0.1 mg/kg, it is generally unnecessary to calculate the dosage on this basis. This extremely safe antidote should be given in sufficient quantity to reverse opioid bind- ing sites. For children younger than age 1 year, 1 ampoule (0.4 mg) should be given initially; if there is no response, five more ampoules (2 mg) should be given rapidly. Older children should be given 0.4–0.8 mg, followed by 2–4 mg if there is no   CHAPTER 12 332 response. An improvement in respiratory status may be fol- lowed by respiratory depression, because the antagonist’s duration of action is less than 1 hour. Neonates poisoned in utero may require 10–30 mg/kg to reverse the effect. B. Withdrawal in the Addict Diazepam (10 mg every 6 hours PO) has been recommended for the treatment of mild narcotic withdrawal in ambulatory adolescents. Management of withdrawal in the confirmed addict may be accomplished with the administration of cloni- dine, by substitution with methadone, or with reintroduction of the original addicting agent, if available through a supervised drug withdrawal program. A tapered course over 3 weeks will accomplish this goal. Death rarely, if ever, occurs. The abrupt discontinuation of narcotics (cold turkey method) is not rec- ommended and may cause severe physical withdrawal signs. C. Withdrawal in the Newborn A newborn infant in opioid withdrawal is usually small for gestational age and demonstrates yawning, sneezing, decreased Moro reflex, hunger but uncoordinated sucking action, jitteri- ness, tremor, constant movement, a shrill protracted cry, increased tendon reflexes, convulsions, vomiting, fever, watery diarrhea, cyanosis, dehydration, vasomotor instability, seizure, and collapse. The onset of symptoms commonly begins in the first 48 hours but may be delayed as long as 8 days, depending on the timing of the mother’s last fix and her predelivery medica- tion. The diagnosis can be confirmed easily by identifying the narcotic in the urine of the mother and the newborn. Several treatment methods have been suggested for nar- cotic withdrawal in the newborn. Phenobarbital (8 mg/kg/d IM or PO in 4 doses for 4 days and then reduced by one third every 2 days as signs decrease) may be continued for as long as 3 weeks. Methadone may be necessary in those infants with congenital methadone addiction who are not controlled in their withdrawal by large doses of phenobarbital. Dosage should be 0.5 mg/kg/d in two divided doses but can be increased gradually as needed. After control of the symptoms is achieved, the dose may be tapered over 4 weeks. It is unclear whether prophylactic treatment with these drugs decreases the complication rate. The mortality rate of untreated narcotic withdrawal in the newborn may be as high as 45%.

354,Psychotropic Drugs,Poisoning ,4794,"PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS Psychotropic drugs consist of four general classes: stimulants (amphetamines, cocaine), depressants (eg, narcotics, barbi- turates), antidepressants and tranquilizers, and hallucino- gens (eg, LSD, PCP).   CHAPTER 12 334 experiencing adverse reactions such as panic states, drug psychoses, homicidal or suicidal thoughts, or respiratory depression. Even with cooperative patients, an accurate history is difficult to obtain. A drug history is most easily obtained in a quiet spot by a gentle, nonthreatening, honest examiner, and without the parents present. The user often does not really know what drug has been taken or how much. Street drugs are almost always adulterated with one or more other compounds. Multiple drugs are often taken together. Friends may be a useful source of information. The patient’s general appearance, skin, lymphatics, car- diorespiratory status, GI tract, and CNS should be focused on during the physical examination, because they often provide clues suggesting drug abuse. Hallucinogens are not life-threatening unless the patient is frankly homicidal or suicidal. A specific diagnosis is usually not necessary for management; instead, the present- ing signs and symptoms are treated. Does the patient appear intoxicated? In withdrawal? “Flashing back?” Is some illness or injury (eg, head trauma) being masked by a drug effect? (Remember that a known drug user may still have hallucina- tions from meningoencephalitis.) The signs and symptoms in a given patient are a function not only of the drug and the dose but also of the level of acquired tolerance, the “setting,” the patient’s physical con- dition and personality traits, the potentiating effects of other drugs, and many other factors. A common drug problem is the “bad trip,” which is usually a panic reaction. This is best managed by “talking the patient down” and minimizing auditory and visual stimuli. Allowing the patient to sit with a friend while the drug effect dissipates may be the best treatment. This may take several hours. The physician’s job is not to terminate the drug effect but to help the patient through the bad experience. Drug therapy is often unnecessary and may complicate the clinical course of a drug-related panic reaction. Although phenothiazines have been commonly used to treat bad trips, they should be avoided if the specific drug is unknown, because they may enhance toxicity or produce unwanted side effects. Diazepam is the drug of choice if a sedative effect is required. Physical restraints are rarely indi- cated and usually increase the patient’s panic reaction. For treatment of life-threatening drug abuse, consult the section on the specific drug elsewhere in this chapter and the section on general management at the beginning of the chapter. After the acute episode, the physician must decide whether psychiatric referral is indicated; in general, patients who have made suicidal gestures or attempts and adolescents who are not communicating with their families should be referred.

356,Salicylates,Poisoning ,2935,"SALICYLATES The use of childproof containers and publicity regarding accidental poisoning have reduced the incidence of acute salicylate poisoning. Nevertheless, serious intoxication still occurs and must be regarded as an emergency. In recent years, the frequency of poisoning has begun to rise again. Salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased heat production, excessive sweating, and dehy- dration. They also interfere with glucose metabolism and may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Respiratory cen- ter stimulation occurs early. Patients usually have signs of hyperventilation, sweating, dehydration, and fever. Vomiting and diarrhea sometimes occur. In severe cases, disorientation, convulsions, and coma may develop. The severity of acute intoxication can, in some measure, be judged by serum salicylate levels. High levels are always dangerous irrespective of clinical signs, and low levels may be misleading in chronic cases. Other laboratory values usually indicate metabolic acidosis despite hyperventilation, low serum K+ values, and often abnormal serum glucose levels. In mild and moderate poisoning, stimulation of the respiratory center produces respiratory alkalosis. In severe intoxication (occurring in severe acute ingestion with high salicylate levels and in chronic toxicity with lower levels), respiratory response is unable to overcome the metabolic overdose. Once the urine becomes acidic, progressively smaller amounts of salicylate are excreted. Until this process is reversed, the half-life will remain prolonged, because metab- olism contributes little to the removal of salicylate. Chronic severe poisoning may occur as early as 3 days after a regimen of salicylate is begun. Findings usually include vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.  Treatment Charcoal binds salicylates well and should be given for acute ingestions. Mild poisoning may require only the administra- tion of oral fluids and confirmation that the salicylate level is falling. Moderate poisoning involves moderate dehydration and depletion of potassium. Fluids must be administered at a rate of 2–3 mL/kg/h to correct dehydration and produce urine with a pH of greater than 7.0. Initial IV solutions should be isotonic, with sodium bicarbonate constituting half the electrolyte content. Once the patient is rehydrated, the solution can contain more free water and approximately 40 mEq/L of K+. Severe toxicity is marked by major dehydration. Symp- toms may be confused with those of Reye syndrome, enceph- alopathy, and metabolic acidosis. Salicylate levels may even be in the therapeutic range. Major fluid correction of dehy- dration is required. Once this has been accomplished, hypo- kalemia must be corrected and sodium bicarbonate given. Usual requirements are sodium bicarbonate, 1–2 mEq/kg/h   POISONING 335 over the first 6–8 hours, and K+, 20–40 mEq/L. A urine flow of 2–3 mL/kg/h should be established. Despite this treatment some patients will develop the paradoxical aciduria of sali- cylism. This is due to hypokalemia and the saving of K+ and excretion of H+ in the renal tubule. Correction of K+ will allow the urine to become alkaline and ionize the salicylate, resulting in excretion rather than reabsorption of nonion- ized salicylate in acid urine. Renal failure or pulmonary edema is an indication for dialysis. Hemodialysis is most effective and peritoneal dialy- sis is relatively ineffective. Hemodialysis should be used in all patients with altered mental status or deteriorating clinical status. Acetazolamide should not be used.

357,Scorpion Stings,Poisoning ,873,"SCORPION STINGS Scorpion stings are common in arid areas of the southwest- ern United States. Scorpion venom is more toxic than most snake venoms, but only minute amounts are injected. Although neurologic manifestations may last a week, most clinical signs subside within 24–48 hours. The most common scorpions in the United States are Vejovis, Hadrurus, Androctonus, and Centruroides species. Stings by the first three produce edema and pain. Stings by Centruroides (the Bark scorpion) cause tingling or burning paresthesias that begin at the site of the sting; other findings include hypersalivation, restlessness, muscular fasciculation, abdominal cramps, opisthotonos, convulsions, urinary incon- tinence, and respiratory failure.  Treatment Sedation is the primary therapy. Antivenom is reserved for severe poisoning. In severe cases, the airway may become compromised by secretions and weakness of respiratory mus- cles. Endotracheal intubation may be required. Patients may require treatment for seizures, hypertension, or tachycardia. The prognosis is good as long as the patient’s airway is managed appropriately.

SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS Fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft) and many other agents comprise this class of drugs. Adverse effects in therapeutic dosing include suicidal thoughts, aggressive behavior, extrapyramidal effects, and cardiac dys- rhythmias, and in overdose may include vomiting, lethargy, seizures, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain. The findings in overdose are included in the serotonin syndrome due to the action of these drugs, which results in an increase of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5- HT]). Despite the degree of toxicity these agents generally are not life–threatening and intervention usually is not necessary. Emptying the stomach is not helpful, but activated char- coal may be useful. Laboratory measurements of the drugs are not of benefit other than to establish their presence. Treatment with benzodiazepines is the most beneficial. Hypotension may be treated with fluids or norepinephrine. Cyproheptadine is an antagonist of serotonin, but its use has been limited. A dose of 0.25 mg/kg/d divided every 6 hours to a maximum of 12 mg/d may be useful in treating the serotonin syndrome. Adults and older adolescents have been treated with 12 mg initially followed by 2 mg every 2 hours to a maximum of 32 mg/d. Boyer EW, Shannon M: The serotonin syndrome. N Engl J Med 2005;352:1112 [PMID: 15784664]. SNAKEBITE Despite the lethal potential of venomous snakes, human morbidity and mortality rates are surprisingly low. The outcome depends on the size of the child, the site of the bite, the degree of envenomation, the type of snake, and the effectiveness of treatment. Nearly all poisonous snakebites in the United States are caused by pit vipers (rattlesnakes, water moccasins, and copperheads). A few are caused by elapids (coral snakes), and occasional bites occur from cobras and other nonindig- enous exotic snakes kept as pets. Snake venom is a complex mixture of enzymes, peptides, and proteins that may have predominantly cytotoxic, neurotoxic, hemotoxic, or car- diotoxic effects but other effects as well. Up to 25% of bites by pit vipers do not result in venom injection. Pit viper venom causes predominantly local injury with pain, discol- oration, edema, and hemorrhage. Swelling and pain occur soon after rattlesnake bite and are a certain indication that envenomation has occurred. During the first few hours, swelling and ecchymosis extend proximally from the bite. The bite is often obvious as a double puncture mark surrounded by ecchymosis. Hemate- mesis, melena, hemoptysis, and other manifestations of coagulopathy develop in severe cases. Respiratory difficulty and shock are the ultimate causes of death. Even in fatal rattlesnake bites, a period of 6–8 hours usually elapses between the bite and death; as a result, there is usually enough time to start effective treatment. Coral snake envenomation causes little local pain, swell- ing, or necrosis; and systemic reactions are often delayed. The signs of coral snake envenomation include bulbar paral- ysis, dysphagia, and dysphoria; these signs may appear in 5– 10 hours and may be followed by total peripheral paralysis and death in 24 hours.   POISONING 335 over the first 6–8 hours, and K+, 20–40 mEq/L.

The outcome depends on the size of the child, the site of the bite, the degree of envenomation, the type of snake, and the effectiveness of treatment. Nearly all poisonous snakebites in the United States are caused by pit vipers (rattlesnakes, water moccasins, and copperheads). A few are caused by elapids (coral snakes), and occasional bites occur from cobras and other nonindig- enous exotic snakes kept as pets. Snake venom is a complex mixture of enzymes, peptides, and proteins that may have predominantly cytotoxic, neurotoxic, hemotoxic, or car- diotoxic effects but other effects as well. Up to 25% of bites by pit vipers do not result in venom injection. Pit viper venom causes predominantly local injury with pain, discol- oration, edema, and hemorrhage. Swelling and pain occur soon after rattlesnake bite and are a certain indication that envenomation has occurred. During the first few hours, swelling and ecchymosis extend proximally from the bite. The bite is often obvious as a double puncture mark surrounded by ecchymosis. Hemate- mesis, melena, hemoptysis, and other manifestations of coagulopathy develop in severe cases. Respiratory difficulty and shock are the ultimate causes of death. Even in fatal rattlesnake bites, a period of 6–8 hours usually elapses between the bite and death; as a result, there is usually enough time to start effective treatment. Coral snake envenomation causes little local pain, swell- ing, or necrosis; and systemic reactions are often delayed. The signs of coral snake envenomation include bulbar paral- ysis, dysphagia, and dysphoria; these signs may appear in 5– 10 hours and may be followed by total peripheral paralysis and death in 24 hours.

A. Emergency (First-Aid) Treatment The most important first-aid measure is transportation to a medical facility. Splint the affected extremity and minimize the patient’s motion. Tourniquets and ice packs are contra- indicated. Incision and suction are not useful for either crotalid or elapid snake bite. B. Definitive Medical Management Blood should be drawn for hematocrit, clotting time and platelet function, and serum electrolyte determinations. Establish two secure IV sites for the administration of anti- venom and other medications. Specific antivenom is indicated when signs of progres- sive envenomation are present. Two antivenoms are avail- able for treating pit viper envenomation: polyvalent pit viper antivenom and polyvalent Crotalidae Fab (CroFab). Both are effective, but their indications differ. For coral snake bites, an eastern coral snake antivenom (Wyeth Lab- oratories) is available. Patients with pit viper bites should receive antivenom if progressive local injury, coagulopathy, or systemic signs (eg, hypotension, confusion) are present. (Antivenom should not be given IM or SQ.) See package labeling or call your certified poison center for details of use. Hemorrhage, pain, and shock diminish rapidly with ade- quate amounts of antivenom. For coral snake bites, give three to five vials of antivenom in 250–500 mL of isotonic saline solution. An additional three to five vials may be required. To control pain, administer a narcotic analgesic, such as meperidine (0.6–1.5 mg/kg per dose, given PO or IM). Cryotherapy is contraindicated because it commonly causes additional tissue damage. Early physiotherapy minimizes contractures. In rare cases, fasciotomy to relieve pressure within muscular compartments is required. The evaluation of function and of pulses will better predict the need for fasciotomy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids (hydrocorti- sone, 1 mg/kg, given PO for a week) are useful in the treatment of serum sickness or anaphylactic shock. Antibi- otics are not needed unless clinical signs of infection occur. Tetanus status should be evaluated and the patient immu- nized, if needed.

358,Soaps & Detergents,Poisoning ,2607,"SOAPS & DETERGENTS 1. Soaps Soap is made from salts of fatty acids. Some toilet soap bars contain both soap and detergent. Ingestion of soap bars may cause vomiting and diarrhea, but they have a low toxicity. Induced emesis is unnecessary. 2. Detergents Detergents are nonsoap synthetic products used for cleaning purposes because of their surfactant properties. Commercial products include granules, powders, and liquids. Dishwasher detergents are very alkaline and can cause caustic burns. Low concentrations of bleaching and antibacterial agents as well as enzymes are found in many preparations. The pure compounds are moderately toxic, but the concentration used is too small to alter the product’s toxicity significantly, although occasional primary or allergic irritative phenomena have been noted in persons who frequently use such prod- ucts and in employees manufacturing these products. A. Cationic Detergents (Ceepryn,  Diaparene Cream, Phemerol, Zephiran) Cationic detergents in dilute solutions (0.5%) cause mucosal irritation, but higher concentrations (10–15%) may cause caustic burns to mucosa. Clinical effects include nausea, vomiting, collapse, coma, and convulsions. As little as 2.25 g of some cationic agents have caused death in an adult. In four cases, 100–400 mg/kg of benzalkonium chloride caused death. Cationic detergents are rapidly inactivated by tissues and ordinary soap. Because of the caustic potential and rapid onset of sei- zures, emesis is not recommended. Activated charcoal should be administered. Anticonvulsants may be needed. B. Anionic Detergents Most common household detergents are anionic. Laundry compounds have water softener (sodium phosphate) added, which is a strong irritant and may reduce ionized calcium. Anionic detergents irritate the skin by removing natural oils. Although ingestion causes diarrhea, intestinal distention, and vomiting, no fatalities have been reported. The only treatment usually required is to discontinue use if skin irritation occurs and replace fluids and electrolytes. Induced vomiting is not indicated following ingestion of automatic dishwasher detergent, because of its alkalinity. Dilute with water or milk. C. Nonionic Detergents (Brij Products;  Tritons X-45, X-100, X-102, and X-144) These compounds include lauryl, stearyl, and oleyl alco- hols and octyl phenol.

359,Spider Bites,Poisoning ,416,"SPIDER BITES Most medically important bites in the United States are caused by the black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans) and the North American brown recluse (violin) spider (Loxosce- les reclusa). Positive identification of the spider is helpful, because many spider bites may mimic those of the brown recluse spider. 1. Black Widow Spider The black widow spider is endemic to nearly all areas of the United States. The initial bite causes sharp fleeting pain. Local and systemic muscular cramping, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and shock can occur. Convulsions occur more commonly in small children than in older children. Systemic signs of black widow spider bite may be confused with other causes of acute abdomen. Although paresthesias, nervousness, and transient muscle spasms may persist for weeks in survivors, recovery from the acute phase is generally complete within 3 days. In contrast to popular opinion, death is extremely rare. Most authors recommend calcium gluconate as initial therapy (50 mg/kg IV per dose, up to 250 mg/kg/24 h), although it is often not effective and the effects are of short duration. Methocarbamol (15 mg/kg PO) or diazepam titrated to effect is useful. Morphine or barbiturates may occasionally be needed for control of pain or restlessness, but they increase the possibility of respiratory depression. Anti- venom is available but should be reserved for severe cases in which the previously mentioned therapies have failed. Local treatment of the bite is not helpful. 2. Brown Recluse Spider (Violin Spider) The North American brown recluse spider is most com- monly seen in the central and Midwestern areas of the United States. Its bite characteristically produces a localized reaction with progressively severe pain within 24 hours. The initial bleb on an erythematous ischemic base is replaced by a black eschar within 1 week. This eschar separates in 2–5 weeks, leaving an ulcer that heals slowly. Systemic signs include cyanosis, morbilliform rash, fever, chills, malaise, weakness, nausea and vomiting, joint pains, hemolytic reac- tions with hemoglobinuria, jaundice, and delirium. Fatalities are rare. Fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported. Although of unproved efficacy, the following therapies have been used: dexamethasone, 4 mg IV four times a day, during the acute phase; polymorphonuclear leukocyte inhib- itors, such as dapsone or colchicine, and oxygen applied to the bite site; and total excision of the lesion to the fascial level.

Maxi- mal clinical effect occurs about 9 days after ingestion— several days after the protein-bound iodine level has fallen dramatically. Administer activated charcoal. If the patient develops clinical signs of toxicity, propranolol, 0.01–0.1 mg/kg (max- imum, 1 mg), is useful because of its antiadrenergic activity.

Stenmark, MD Caring for critically ill children remains one of the most demanding and challenging aspects of pediatrics. The care of patients with life-threatening conditions, from serious med- ical illness to traumatic injuries and recovery from major surgery, requires a detailed understanding of human physi- ology and the pathophysiology of major illnesses, as well as an understanding of and experience with the rapidly chang- ing technologies available in a modern intensive care unit (ICU). In addition, the science of caring for the critically ill patient has evolved rapidly over the past decade, as the molecular mediators of illness have become better defined and new therapies have been devised based on those advances. As a result, critical care is more than ever a multidis- ciplinary field that requires a team-oriented approach, includ- ing critical care physicians and nursing staff, pharmacists, referring physicians, consulting specialists, and social ser- vices specialists. The intensivist plays an essential role in coordinating and directing the care provided by the ICU team, and stands at the crossroads of the various participating disciplines. There are two primary models of ICU organization: “open” units, where primary responsibility for the patient remains with the referring physician and secondary responsibility lies with the intensivist as consultant; and “closed” units, where only the on-site intensivist is allowed to write orders directing the patient’s care. Although the merits of these organizational approaches are debated, a substantial and growing body of evidence from studies conducted in adult medical, surgical, and pediatric ICUs suggests that the closed ICU model leads to significant reductions in ICU length of stay and resource use, and to reductions in mortality of as much as 15%. An additional factor to consider in the provision of critical care services for children is the cost of those services in relation to the outcomes achieved. Critical care services in the United States are estimated to account for 30% of all acute-care hospital costs; some estimates run as high as 1% of the gross national product. One study examining the cost- effectiveness of pediatric ICU care, compared with adult ICU care, found that the short- and long-term mortality among pediatric patients was three times lower than it was among adult ICU patients, despite similar ICU costs and length of stay. These findings suggest that pediatric critical care ser- vices are relatively cost-effective.

361,Acute Respiratory Failure,Poisoning ,3384,"ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE Acute respiratory failure, defined as the inability of the respiratory system to adequately deliver oxygen or remove carbon dioxide, contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality of critically ill children. This condition accounts for approximately 50% of deaths in children younger than age 1 year. Anatomic and developmental differences place infants at higher risk than adults for respi- ratory failure. An infant’s thoracic cage is more compliant than that of the adult or older child. The intercostal muscles are poorly developed and unable to achieve the “bucket- handle” motion characteristic of adult breathing. Further- more, the diaphragm is shorter and relatively flat with fewer type I muscle fibers, and therefore less effective and more easily fatigued.

MECHANICAL VENTILATION The increased compliance of an infant’s chest wall, the relative alveolar hypoplasia in early childhood, the small caliber of the airways, and the small tidal volumes of young children make mechanical ventilation of the pediatric patient challenging. The goals of mechanical ventilation are to facil- itate the movement of gas into and out of the lungs (ventila- tion) and to improve oxygen uptake into the bloodstream (oxygenation). Modern mechanical ventilators can accom- plish these objectives in a variety of ways. Depending on the mode of ventilation selected, the ventilator can deliver a machine-controlled breath (control ventilation), or can assist the patient’s own spontaneous respiratory efforts (sup- port ventilation), or can do both (mixed mode ventilation). Additionally, ventilator breaths can be delivered as a targeted tidal volume (volume ventilation) or as a targeted airway pressure (pressure ventilation). This section describes the modes of mechanical ventilation most commonly used in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Pressure Ventilation In pressure-controlled modes of ventilation, air flow begins at the start of the inspiratory cycle and continues until a preset airway pressure is reached. That airway pressure is then maintained until, at the end of the set inspiratory time, the exhalation valve on the ventilator opens and gas exits into the machine. Because airway pressure is the controlling variable with this mode of ventilation, changes in the compliance of the respiratory system will lead to fluctuations in the actual tidal volume delivered to the patient. The advantage of pres- sure-controlled ventilation lies primarily in the avoidance of high airway pressures that might cause lung injury or barotrauma, particularly in patients with fragile lung paren- chyma, such as premature infants. The main disadvantage of pressure-controlled ventilation is the possibility of delivering either inadequate or excessive tidal volumes during periods of changing lung compliance, as described earlier.

Frequent, preferably continuous, blood pressure monitoring is also necessary for patients receiving oxygen at a high PEEP, given the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Adjusting the Ventilator Mechanical ventilation can assist with both ventilation (PCO2) and oxygenation (PO2). Ventilation is most closely associated with the delivered minute volume, or the tidal volume multiplied by the respiratory rate. Abnormal PCO2 values can be most effectively addressed by changes in the respiratory rate or the tidal volume. Increased rate or tidal volume should increase minute volume and thus decrease PCO2 levels; decreases in rate or tidal volume should act in the opposite fashion. In some circumstances, additional adjustments may also be necessary. For example, for patients with disease characterized by extensive alveolar collapse, increasing PEEP may improve ventilation by helping to keep open previously collapsed lung units. Also, for patients with disease characterized by significant airway obstruction, decreases in respiratory rate may allow more time for exha- lation and improve ventilation despite an apparent decrease in the minute volume provided. The variables most closely associated with oxygenation are the inspired oxygen concentration and the mean airway pressure during the respiratory cycle. Increases in inspired oxygen concentration will generally increase arterial oxygen- ation, unless right-to-left intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting is a significant component of the patient’s illness. Concentrations of inspired oxygen above 60–65%, however, may lead to hyperoxic lung injury. Patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring those levels of oxygen or higher to maintain adequate arterial saturations should have their hypoxemia addressed by increases in mean airway pressure. Mean airway pressure is affected by PEEP, peak inspira- tory pressure, and inspiratory time. Increases in any one of those factors will increase mean airway pressure and should improve arterial oxygenation. It is important to bear in mind, however, that increases in mean airway pressure may also lead to decreases in cardiac output. In this circumstance, raising mean airway pressure may increase arterial oxygen- ation but actually compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues. For patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, these tradeoffs highlight the need for careful monitoring by expe- rienced personnel. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is an alternate mode of mechanical ventilation in which the venti- lator provides very small, very rapid tidal volumes. Respira- tory rates used during oscillatory ventilation typically range from 5–10 Hz (rates of 300–600 breaths/min) in most PICU patients. This mode of ventilation has been used successfully for neonates, older pediatric patients, and adults; and for diseases as diverse as pneumonia, pulmonary contusion, ARDS, and asthma. HFOV is increasingly used as initial therapy in severe, diffuse lung diseases, such as ARDS, which require high mean airway pressures to maintain oxygen- ation. The advantage of HFOV is that these high levels of mean airway pressure can be achieved without high peak inspiratory pressures or large tidal volumes, thus theoreti- cally protecting the lung from ventilator-induced lung injury. Disadvantages of HFOV include general poor toler- ance by patients who are not heavily sedated or paralyzed, the risk of cardiovascular compromise due to high mean airway pressures, and the risk of barotrauma in patients with heterogeneous lung disease. Although HFOV clearly may be useful for selected patients, it remains unclear whether HFOV provides a benefit compared with carefully managed conventional modes of ventilation. Managing the Ventilated Patient Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation require the same meticulous supportive care given to all PICU patients. Since mechanical ventilation is often frightening and uncomfortable for patients, leading to dyssynchrony with the ventilator and impaired ventilation and oxygenation, careful attention must be directed toward optimizing comfort and decreasing anxi- ety. Sedative-anxiolytics are typically provided as intermittent doses of benzodiazepines, with or without opioids. Some patients respond better to the steady state of sedation provided by continuous infusion of these agents, although oversedation of the ventilated patient may lead to longer durations of ventilation and difficulties with weaning from the ventilator. For a patient with severe respiratory illness, even small movements by the patient may compromise ventilation and oxygenation. In such cases, muscle paralysis may facilitate oxygenation and ventilation. Nondepolarizing neuromuscu- lar blocking agents are most commonly used for this purpose, given as intermittent doses or as continuous infusions. When muscle relaxants are given, extra care must be taken to ensure that levels of sedation are adequate, as many of the usual signs of patient discomfort are masked by the paralytics.

372,Indications for Central Venous & Arterial  Cannulation,Poisoning ,17,"INDICATIONS FOR CENTRAL  VENOUS & ARTERIAL CANNULATION Placement of catheters into the central venous or arterial circulation may be justified for continuous assessment of intravascular volume or cardiac function; blood drawing for lab work; or administration of volume, drugs, or hyperali- mentation. One should always weigh the risks of bleeding, infection, and clotting against the expected benefits before placing any indwelling catheter. General Rules for  Cannulation of the Venous System 1. Perform a “time-out” before beginning. Confirm out loud with the bedside nurse, the identity of the patient, the procedure needed, and the intended site for line placement. 2. Set up and examine all equipment needed before getting started. Use of a limited number of kits and equipment will provide greater consistency and success. 3. Properly position the patient. 4. Apply EMLA cream (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics, lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) to the area of punc- ture (45 minutes before the procedure) or infiltrate with local anesthetic before prepping the skin. Sedation is often necessary but should be performed by a qualified person. 5. The remainder of the procedure should occur under aseptic technique (including gown, mask, and hair cover for operator and assistant). 6. Sterilize and drape the area around the point of entry. 7. When searching for the vessel, make straight passes while maintaining slight negative pressure. Advance and withdraw the needle at the same speed. Frequently, the blood return will occur during withdrawal. 8. Once there is free flow of venous blood into the syringe, remove the syringe without moving the needle, and if using the Seldinger technique, pass the J wire through the needle. When appropriate (subclavian and internal jugular vein cannulations), watch the electrocardiogram for arrhythmias, because they frequently occur when the J wire touches the right side of the heart. 9. Withdraw the needle over the J wire and clean the wire of blood. 10. If using a 5F or larger catheter, make a small nick with a No. 11 blade at the point where the J wire enters the skin. Dilate central veins by passing the dilator over the J wire into the vein. Remove the dilator (skip this step for arterial cannulation) and pass the intravascu- lar catheter over the J wire. As you advance the catheter toward the entry site into the skin be sure the wire is always visible, or protrudes out the end of the catheter, to prevent the wire becoming lodged within the vessel. 11. With the catheters in place, remove the wire. 12. Check to make sure that blood can be drawn and flushed easily through each port of the new line. Withdraw blood through a syringe containing saline before flush- ing to prevent introduction of air bubbles. 13. Suture the line in place. 14. Verify the position of the line on radiograph. Points of Entry for Venous Line Placement A. External Jugular Vein Place a soft cloth roll beneath the patient’s shoulder and turn the head to the contralateral side (Figure 13–2). The Valsalva maneuver, Trendelenburg position, and occlusion of the vessel at the clavicular level are ways of temporarily increas- ing jugular distention and visibility. To overcome the problems of this vessel’s mobility and thick wall, apply cephalic retraction of the skin over the vessel superior to the point of needle entry. Maintain gentle negative pressure in the syringe attached to the needle as it is advanced toward the vessel. Needle entry into the vessel lumen is usually signaled by a change in resistance followed by appearance of venous blood in the hub of the needle. Remove the syringe without moving the needle and pass a soft J wire into the vessel lumen. Remove the needle and pass the central line over the J wire. B. Internal Jugular Vein Once the patient has been prepped, draped, and positioned as shown in Figure 13–3, feel for the trachea halfway between ▲ Figure 13–2. External jugular vein technique.

375,Brain Injury & Cerebral Edema,Poisoning ,825,"BRAIN INJURY & CEREBRAL EDEMA Intracranial hypertension is a common feature of many ill- nesses treated in the PICU (Table 13–8). The early signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension (Table 13–9) tend to be nonspecific. The classic Cushing triad of bradycardia, hyperten- sion, and apnea occurs late and is often incomplete in children. Accurate assessment and treatment of elevations in ICP requires an understanding of the basic pathophysiology of intracranial hypertension and of the current evidence sup- porting the various treatment options. Most of our under- standing and approach to treatment is based on studies of patients with traumatic brain injuries. Whether those con- cepts are directly relevant to the pathophysiologic processes involved in more global CNS injuries, such as hypoxia and metabolic disorders, remains a matter of debate. Within the constraints of a closed skull, an enlargement of brain tissue, an increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or an increased volume of blood (or the presence of a space-occupying lesion such as a tumor or an abscess) will reduce the size of the other compartments or increase pressure. The factors contributing to intracranial hyperten- sion can be understood by considering each of these three primary compartments. The brain occupies about 80% of the volume of the skull. Apart from solid tumors, increases in the brain compartment are generally a result of cerebral edema. Cerebral edema can be divided into three forms: vasogenic, hydrostatic, and cytotoxic. Vasogenic edema occurs in areas of inflamed tissue characterized by increased capillary permeability, and is most typical around CNS tumors, abscesses, and infarcts. This form of edema is thought to be at least partially responsive to corticosteroid therapy. Hydrostatic, or interstitial, edema is a result of elevated CSF hydrostatic pressures. It occurs primarily in lesions associated with obstruction to CSF flow, and in a typical periventricular distribution. This form of edema is best treated by CSF drainage. The third form of cerebral edema, cytotoxic edema, is the most common of the three forms seen in the PICU and is, unfortunately, the least easily treated. Cytotoxic edema occurs as a result of direct injury to brain cells, often leading to irreversible cell swelling and death. This form of cerebral edema is typical of traumatic brain injuries as well as hypoxic-ischemic injuries and metabolic disease. CSF occupies an estimated 10% of the intracranial space. Intracranial hypertension due primarily to increases in CSF volume (eg, hydrocephalus, primary or secondary) is gener- ally easily diagnosed by computed tomography scan and easily treated with appropriate drainage and shunting. Cerebral blood volume comprises the final 10% of the intracranial space. Changes in cerebral blood volume gener- ally result from alterations in vascular diameter in response to local metabolic demands or to local vascular pressures— Table 13–8.

Early Poor feeding, vomiting Irritability, lethargy Seizures Hypertension Late Coma Decerebrate responses Cranial nerve palsies Abnormal respirations Bradycardia Hypertension Apnea   CRITICAL CARE 355 leads to better outcomes than barbiturate therapy in patients with refractory ICP elevations. Current guidelines suggest the use of mannitol in doses of 0.25–0.5 g/kg for intracranial hypertension unresponsive to sedation. Renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis can be a treatment-limiting side effect, particularly if serum osmolarity is allowed to rise above 320 mmol and intravascular volume depletion occurs. Continuous infusion of 3% saline at 0.1–1 ml/kg/h can alternatively be used to increase osmolarity, using the minimum dose to achieve ICP of less than 20 mm Hg. Serum sodium and osmolarity should be followed and should generally not exceed sodium of 160 mEq/L or serum osmolarity of 360 mOsm/L. Controlled ventilation is recommended for mild to mod- erate intracranial hypertension, maintaining PCO2 of 30–35 mm Hg. Hyperventilation—long a mainstay in the treatment of intracranial hypertension—is controversial and only used in emergent situations involving patients with acute ICP elevations unresponsive to other measures, including seda- tion, paralysis, ventricular drainage, and osmotic diuretics. Although acutely effective in causing cerebral vasoconstric- tion, hyperventilation leads to much larger decreases in blood flow than in blood volume, such that hyperventilation to the point necessary to control ICP may actually compro- mise CNS perfusion and lead to worsened secondary injury. This concept has been confirmed by studies showing worse outcomes in head-injured patients consistently hyperventi- lated to a PCO2 of 25 mm Hg or less. Due to the risks of worsened CNS ischemia, monitoring cerebral perfusion by blood flow studies or jugular bulb saturation is recom- mended for patients undergoing extreme hyperventilation. The use of barbiturates in this setting is based on their suppression of cerebral metabolism and the subsequent metabolic autoregulatory effects on cerebral blood volume. Although effective in many instances for ICP elevations, these agents are potent cardiac depressants, and their use often leads to hypotension, necessitating the use of a pressor to maintain perfusion. In addition, plasma barbiturate levels correlate poorly with effect on ICP, suggesting that monitor- ing of CNS electrical activity by electroencephalography is necessary to accurately titrate their use. Current guidelines suggest the use of barbiturates for treating intracranial hypertension refractory to sedation, paralysis, ventricular drainage, and osmotic diuretics. Another important concept in the management of intra- cranial hypertension is that of the cerebral perfusion pres- sure. The cerebral perfusion pressure is the driving pressure across the cerebral circulation and is defined as mean arterial pressure minus CVP (or ICP, whichever is higher). Some authors have suggested that careful attention to maintenance of a supranormal cerebral perfusion pressure may lead to better outcomes for head-injured patients. Although there are no well-controlled trials to draw from (particularly for pediatric patients), current guidelines suggest that mainte- nance of a “normal” cerebral perfusion pressure for age (50– 70 mm Hg) is a valid secondary goal of treatment, as long as it is included in a plan to use the other ICP-directed therapies discussed earlier. A suggested treatment algorithm for patients with docu- mented intracranial hypertension is presented in Figure 13–8. As mentioned earlier, this algorithm represents the current best evidence for the management of intracranial hyperten- sion. The information is largely drawn from experience with traumatic brain injuries, and the direct applicability of these concepts to other illnesses associated with intracranial hypertension remains unclear.

Volume  Intracranial pressure  20   CRITICAL CARE 357 Tissue & Organ Donation Organ transplantation has become standard therapy. Although the demand for tissue and solid organs has increased, dona- tions have not. The prospect of organ or tissue donation should be considered with all patients dying in the PICU. To be a solid organ donor, the patient must be clinically brain dead and have no conditions contraindicating donation. With patients from whom life-support must be withdrawn, tissue (heart valves, corneas, skin, and bone) can be obtained after cardiac death. The need for new donor organs has led to the reemergence of procuring organs from nonheartbeating (asystolic) donors. In these cases the family or patient has refused life-sustaining therapy and has chosen to have life-support withdrawn, and to donate organs after death. Death is determined using “traditional” or “cardiopul- monary” criteria of (1) unresponsiveness, (2) apnea, and (3) absent circulation. A high level of scrutiny exists regard- ing nonheartbeating donors in pediatric patients, and before it has wide acceptance standards of practice need to be developed further. The Required Request Law mandates that health care professionals approach all donor-eligible families to inquire about organ procurement. The decision to donate must be made free of coercion, with informed consent, and without financial incentive. Brain Death (See Chapter 23) The development of criteria and expertise in the clinical brain death exam arose out of the demand for solid organs from patients still receiving LSMT. Currently, the diagnosis of brain death is based on national guidelines that render some clarity and standardization to this critical task. Clinical Brain Death Examination Establish the cause of the disease or injury and exclude potentially reversible syndromes that may produce signs similar to brain death.

379,Nutritional Support of the Critically Ill Child,Poisoning ,3505,"NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT OF  THE CRITICALLY ILL CHILD Metabolic & Physiologic Responses When severely ill pediatric patients are admitted to the PICU, the initial therapy is directed at the primary or underlying problem and at providing cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic support. Although this management is critical to sustaining life in these patients, provision of adequate nutritional support is often overlooked early in the course of therapy. As increasing evidence demonstrates that nutri- tional status and support affect the morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients, it is vital that this aspect of care be addressed early in the hospital course. Trauma, surgery, burns, and sepsis impose metabolic and physiologic disturbances that vary in degree, but have many similarities. The insult triggers the afferent limb of the neuro- physiologic reflex, which is composed of pain and neurosen- sory pathways. In response, the efferent limb consisting of neurologic and endocrine pathways, increases autonomic sympathetic activity with norepinephrine and epinephrine secretions and increases pituitary release of many hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone, and antidiuretic hormone. Release of catechol- amines inhibits insulin secretion and activity, and stimulates glucagon and ACTH production. ACTH and antidiuretic hormone increase corticosteroid release, inhibit insulin activ- ity, and increase aldosterone. The overall effect is to direct an end-organ increase in metabolic rate and to provide increased substrate availability for energy use (Table 13–10). In addi- tion, the body has a cellular response to tissue injury. Cells 1Cerebral angiography, radionuclide scanning, or transcranial Doppler  ultrasonography can be used to assess brain function if apnea testing  cannot be performed or if there is need for corroborative studies.   CRITICAL CARE 361 Hulst JM et al: Causes and consequences of inadequate substrate supply to pediatric ICU patients.

383,Asthma (Life-Threatening),Poisoning ,695,"ASTHMA (LIFE-THREATENING) Status asthmaticus may be defined as reversible small airway obstruction that is refractory to sympathomimetic and anti- inflammatory agents and that may progress to respiratory failure without prompt and aggressive intervention. Life- threatening asthma is caused by severe bronchospasm, exces- sive mucus secretion, inflammation, and edema of the airways (see Chapter 18). Reversal of these mechanisms is the key to successful treatment. Status asthmaticus remains a common diagnosis among children admitted to the PICU, and asthma is associated with surprisingly high mortality rates. ▲ Figure 13–9.

386,Shock,Poisoning ,794,"SHOCK Shock may be defined as failure of the cardiovascular system to deliver critical substrates (eg, oxygen) and remove toxic metabolites. This failure leads to anaerobic metabolism in cells and ultimately to irreversible cellular damage. Shock has been categorized into a series of recognizable stages: com- pensated, uncompensated, and irreversible. Patients in compensated shock have relatively normal cardiac output and normal blood pressures, but have alter- ations in the microcirculation that increase flow to some organs and reduce flow to others. In infants, compensatory increase in cardiac output is achieved primarily by tachycar- dia rather than by increase in stroke volume. Heart rates of 190–210 beats/min are common in infants with compen- sated shock, but heart rates over 220 beats/min raise the possibility of supraventricular tachycardia. In older patients, cardiac contractility (stroke volume) and heart rate increase to improve cardiac output. Blood pressure remains normal initially because of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance. Thus hypotension occurs late and is more characteristic of the uncompensated stage of shock. In the uncompensated stage, the oxygen and nutrient supply to the cells deteriorates further with subsequent cellular breakdown and release of toxic substances, causing further redistribution of flow. At this point, the patient is hypotensive, with poor cardiac output.  Classification Shock can be classified by mechanism into hypovolemic (including distributive), cardiogenic, and septic. Often, two or three of these occur together. A. Hypovolemic Shock Hypovolemic shock is caused by decreased circulating blood volume or preload. This may result from loss of whole blood or plasma or from fluid loss from the kidney or gut. These patients usually have intact compensatory mechanisms that maintain normal blood pressure by increasing cardiac out- put and shunting blood away from certain organs. These responses protect blood flow to the heart and brain. Untreated, hypovolemic shock can progress to an irrevers- ible stage. Additionally, a relative hypovolemia occurs when arterial and capillary shunting past tissue beds occurs with an increase in venous capacitance, causing blood to pool—so- called distributive shock. This results from anaphylaxis or vasodilating drugs. B. Cardiogenic Shock/Failure Age-dependent differences occur in myocardial physiology that are relevant to therapy. Neonatal myocardium has reduced systolic performance and contractility. The sarco- lemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and T-tubules are less well developed, resulting in a greater dependency on trans-sarco- lemma Ca2+ flux (ie, extracellular serum Ca2+) for contrac- tion. A high resting state of myocardial contractility occurs that limits the response to inotropic agents. Relatively minor increases in afterload can result in diminished stroke vol- ume. Diastolic compliance is diminished, and small changes in volume result in large changes in ventricular wall tension. Consequently preload reserve is limited, and maximization of the Frank-Starling curve occurs relatively quickly (10–15 mm Hg in animal models). Aggressive volume resuscitation beyond this is often ineffective and not tolerated. Stroke volume is relatively fixed, and greater increases in cardiac output are seen through increased heart rate. Central to the understanding of cardiogenic failure are the progressive nature of ventricular dysfunction and the compensatory mechanisms that occur in the presence of excessive hemodynamic demands. Inadequate cardiac out- put activates the renin-angiotensin system. The consequent sodium and water retention augments intravascular volume and increases cardiac output through increased preload. With progression, cardiac compliance is decreased and pre- load augmentation via the Frank-Starling mechanism is maximized. Subsequently, small changes in ventricular vol- ume can lead to large increases in ventricular pressure, and therefore pulmonary venous pressure, with resultant pulmo- nary edema. Thus fluids should be cautiously administered in this setting and should possibly be guided by central venous pressure or left atrial/pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure monitoring. The atrial distention that occurs in the failing heart leads to increased production and release of atrial natriuretic peptide, a vasodilator that augments sodium and water excretion. Heart failure also induces autonomic nervous system changes, including increased activation of the adrenergic sympathetic system and decreased parasympathetic stimula- tion. Increased adrenergic tone is associated with elevated circulating norepinephrine levels and increased vasoconstric- tion and afterload. These combined factors in turn lead to a cycle of increased afterload, increased energy expenditure, decreased cardiac output, myocyte death, and progressive ventricular dysfunction.

397,General Principles,Poisoning ,56,"GENERAL PRINCIPLES DIAGNOSIS OF SKIN DISORDERS Examination of the skin requires that the entire surface of the body be palpated and inspected in good light. The onset and duration of each symptom should be recorded, together with a description of the primary lesion and any secondary changes, using the terminology set forth in Table 14–1. In practice, the characteristics of skin lesions are described in an order opposite that shown in the table. Begin with distribu- tion, then configuration, color, secondary changes, and pri- mary changes. For example, guttate psoriasis could be described as generalized, discrete, red, scaly papules. TREATMENT OF SKIN DISORDERS Topical Therapy Treatment should be simple and aimed at preserving normal skin physiology. Topical therapy is often preferred because medication can be delivered in optimal concentrations to the desired site. Water is an important therapeutic agent, and optimally hydrated skin is soft and smooth. This occurs at approxi- mately 60% environmental humidity. Because water evapo- rates readily from the cutaneous surface, skin hydration (stratum corneum of the epidermis) is dependent on the water concentration in the air, and sweating contributes little. However, if sweat is prevented from evaporating (eg, in the axilla, groin), local humidity and hydration of the skin are increased. As humidity falls below 15–20%, the stratum corneum shrinks and cracks; the epidermal barrier is lost and allows irritants to enter the skin and induce an inflammatory response. Replacement of water will correct this condition if evaporation is prevented. Therefore, dry and scaly skin is treated by soaking the skin in water for 5 minutes and then adding a barrier to evaporation (Table 14–2). Oils and ointments prevent evaporation for 8–12 hours, so they must be applied once or twice a day. In areas already occluded (axilla, diaper area), creams or lotions are preferred, but more frequent application may be necessary. Overhydration (maceration) can also occur. As envi- ronmental humidity increases to 90–100%, the number of water molecules absorbed by the stratum corneum increases and the tight lipid junctions between the cells of the stratum corneum are gradually replaced by weak hydrogen bonds; the cells eventually become widely sepa- rated, and the epidermal barrier falls apart. This occurs in immersion foot, diaper areas, axillae, and the like. It is desirable to enhance evaporation of water in these areas by air drying. Wet Dressings By placing the skin in an environment where the humidity is 100% and allowing the moisture to evaporate to 60%, pruritus is relieved. Evaporation of water stimulates cold- dependent nerve fibers in the skin, and this may prevent the transmission of the itching sensation via pain fibers to the central nervous system. It also is vasoconstrictive, thereby helping to reduce the erythema and also decreasing the inflammatory cellular response. The simplest form of wet dressing consists of one set of wet underwear (eg, long johns) worn under dry pajamas. The underwear should be soaked in warm (not hot) water and wrung out until no more drops come out. This should be done overnight for a few days up to 1 week. When the condition has improved, the wet dressings are discontinued. Topical Glucocorticoids Twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids is the mainstay of treatment for all forms of dermatitis (Table 14–3). Topical steroids can also be used under wet dressings. After wet dressings are discontinued, topical steroids should be applied only to areas of active disease. They should never be applied to normal skin to prevent recurrence. Only low-  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

These are occasionally present at birth. Onset after 4–5 days of life is rare. The lesions vary in number from a few up to as many as 100. Incidence is much higher in full-term versus premature infants. The mac- ular erythema may fade within 24–48 hours or may progress to formation of urticarial wheals in the center of the macules or, in 10% of cases, pustules. Examination of a Wright-stained smear of the lesion reveals numerous eosinophils. No organ- isms are seen on Gram stain. These findings may be accompa- nied by peripheral blood eosinophilia of up to 20%. All of the lesions fade and disappear within 5–7 days. Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is a pustular eruption in newborns of African-American descent. The pustules rupture leaving a collarette of scale surrounding a macular hyperpigmentation. Unlike erythema toxicum, the pustules contain mostly neu- trophils and often involve the palms and soles. 7. Sucking Blisters Bullae, either intact or as erosions (the blister base) without inflammatory borders, may occur over the forearms, wrists, thumbs, or upper lip. These presumably result from vigorous sucking in utero. They resolve without complications. 8. Miliaria Obstruction of the eccrine sweat ducts occurs often in neonates and produces one of two clinical pictures. Superfi- cial obstruction in the stratum corneum causes miliaria crystallina, characterized by tiny (1- to 2-mm), superficial grouped vesicles without erythema over intertriginous areas and adjacent skin (eg, neck, upper chest). More commonly, obstruction of the eccrine duct deeper in the epidermis results in erythematous grouped papules in the same areas and is called miliaria rubra. Rarely, these may progress to pustules. Heat and high humidity predispose the patient to eccrine duct pore closure. Removal to a cooler environment is the treatment of choice. 9. Subcutaneous Fat Necrosis This entity presents in the first 7 days of life as reddish or purple, sharply circumscribed, firm nodules occurring over the cheeks, buttocks, arms, and thighs. Cold injury is thought to play an important role. These lesions resolve spontaneously over a period of weeks, although in some instances they may calcify.

PIGMENT CELL BIRTHMARKS,  NEVI, & MELANOMA Birthmarks may involve an overgrowth of one or more of any of the normal components of skin (eg, pigment cells, blood vessels, lymph vessels). A nevus is a hamartoma of highly differentiated cells that retain their normal function. 1. Mongolian Spot A blue-black macule found over the lumbosacral area in 90% of infants of Native-American, African-American, and Asian descent is called a mongolian spot. These spots are occasion- ally noted over the shoulders and back and may extend over the buttocks. Histologically, they consist of spindle-shaped pigment cells located deep in the dermis. The lesions fade somewhat with time as a result of darkening of the overlying skin, but some traces may persist into adult life. 2. Café-au-Lait Macule A café-au-lait macule is a light brown, oval macule (dark brown on brown or black skin) that may be found anywhere on the body. Café-au-lait spots over 1.5 cm in greatest diameter are found in 10% of white and 22% of black children. These lesions persist throughout life and may increase in number with age. The presence of six or more such lesions over 1.5 cm in greatest diameter may be a clue to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Patients with McCune-Albright syndrome (see Chap- ter 32) have a large, unilateral café-au-lait macule. 3. Spitz Nevus A reddish-brown solitary nodule appearing on the face or upper arm of a child represents a Spitz nevus. Histologically, it consists of pigment-producing cells of bizarre shape with numerous mitoses. Although these lesions can look concern- ing histologically, they have a benign clinical course. ACQUIRED MELANOCYTIC NEVI 1. Common Moles Well-demarcated, brown to brown-black macules represent junctional nevi. They can begin to appear in the first years of life and increase with age. Histologically, these lesions are clones of melanocytes at the junction of the epidermis and dermis. Approximately 20% may progress to compound nevi—papular lesions with melanocytes both in junctional and intradermal locations. Intradermal nevi are often lighter in color and can be fleshy and pedunculated. Melanocytes in these lesions are located purely within the dermis. Nevi look dark blue (blue nevi) when they contain more deeply situated melanocytes in the dermis. 2. Melanoma Melanoma in prepubertal children is very rare. Pigmented lesions with variegated colors (red, white, blue), notched borders, asymmetrical shape, and very irregular or ulcerated surfaces should arouse a suspicion of melanoma. Ulceration and bleeding are advanced signs of melanoma. If melanoma is suspected, wide local excision sent for pathologic examina- tion should be done as the treatment of choice. "

Congenital Melanocytic Nevi One in 100 infants is born with a congenital nevus. Congenital nevi tend to be larger and darker brown than acquired nevi and may have many terminal hairs. If the pigmented plaque covers more than 5% of the body surface area, it is considered a giant or large congenital nevus; these large nevi occur in 1 in 20,000 infants. Often the lesions are so large they cover the entire trunk (bathing trunk nevi). Histologically, they are compound nevi with melanocytes often tracking around hair follicles and other adnexal structures deep in the dermis. The risk of malignant melanoma in small congenital nevi is con- troversial in the literature, but most likely very low. Transfor- mation to malignant melanoma in giant congenital nevi has been estimated in the best studies to be between 1% and 5%. Two thirds of melanomas in children with giant congenital nevi develop in areas other than the skin. Krengel S et al: Melanoma risk in congenital melanocytic naevi: A systematic review.

Capillary Malformations  Clinical Findings Capillary malformations are an excess of capillaries in localized areas of skin. The degree of excess is variable. The color of the lesions ranges from light red-pink to dark red. Light red macules are found over the nape of the neck, upper eyelids, and glabella of newborns. Fifty percent of infants have such lesions over their necks. Eyelid and glabellar lesions usually fade completely within the first year of life. Lesions that occupy the total central forehead area usually do not fade. Those on the neck persist into adult life. Port-wine stains are dark red macules appearing anywhere on the body. A bilateral facial port-wine stain or one covering the entire half of the face may be a clue to Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by seizures, mental retarda- tion, glaucoma, and hemiplegia. (See Chapter 23.) Most infants with smaller, unilateral facial port-wine stains do not have Sturge-Weber syndrome. Similarly, a port-wine stain over an extremity may be associated with hypertrophy of the soft tissue and bone of that extremity (Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome).  Treatment The pulsed dye laser is the treatment of choice for infants and children with port-wine stains. Rallan D et al: Laser treatment of vascular lesions. Clin Dermatol 2006;24:8 [PMID: 16427501]. 2. Hemangioma  Clinical Findings A red, rubbery nodule is a hemangioma. The lesion is often not present at birth but is represented by a permanent blanched area on the skin that is supplanted at age 2–4 weeks by red nodules. Histologically, these are benign tumors of capillary endothelial cells. Hemangiomas may be superficial, deep, or mixed. The terms strawberry and cavernous are misleading and should not be used. The biologic behavior of a hemangioma is the same despite its location. Fifty percent reach maximal regression by age 5 years, 70% by age 7 years, and 90% by age 9 years, leaving redundant skin, hypopig- mentation, and telangiectasia. Local complications include superficial ulceration and secondary pyoderma.  Treatment Complications that require immediate treatment are (1) visual obstruction (with resulting amblyopia), (2) airway obstruc- tion (hemangiomas of the head and neck [“beard hemangio- mas”] may be associated with subglottic hemangiomas), and (3) cardiac decompensation (high-output failure). In these instances, the treatment of choice is with prednisolone, 2–3 mg/kg orally daily for 6–12 weeks. Interferon alfa-2a has been used to treat serious hemangiomas unresponsive to predni- sone. Ten percent of patients with hemangiomas treated with interferon alfa-2a have developed spastic diplegia. Therefore, interferon alfa-2a therapy should be reserved for truly life- threatening hemangiomas, unresponsive to prednisolone therapy. If the lesion is ulcerated or bleeding, pulsed dye laser treatment may be helpful. The Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, characterized by platelet trapping with consumption coagu- lopathy, does not occur with solitary cutaneous hemangiomas. It is seen only with internal hemangiomas or the very rare vascular tumors called kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas. Smolinski KN, Yan AC: Hemangiomas of infancy: Clinical and biological characteristics. Clin Pediatr (Phila) 2005;44:747 [PMID: 16327961]. 3. Lymphatic Malformations Lymphatic malformations may be superficial or deep. Superficial lymphatic malformations present as fluid-filled vesicles often described as looking like frog spawn. Deep lymphatic malforma- tions are rubbery, skin-colored nodules occurring most com- monly in the parotid area (cystic hygromas) or on the tongue. They often result in grotesque enlargement of soft tissues. Histo- logically, they can be either macrocystic or microcystic.  Treatment Therapy includes injection of picibanil, doxycycline, or surgery. Lee BB et al: Current concepts in lymphatic malformations. Vasc Endovascular Surg 2005;39:67 [PMID: 15696250].  CHAPTER 14 380 EPIDERMAL BIRTHMARKS 1. Epidermal Nevus  Clinical Findings The majority of these birthmarks present in the first year of life; however, they can first appear in adulthood. They are hamartomas of the epidermis that are warty to papilloma- tous plaques, often in a linear array. They range in color from skin-colored to dirty yellow to brown. Histologically they have a thickened epidermis with hyperkeratosis. The condition of widespread epidermal nevi associated with other developmental anomalies (central nervous system, eye, and skeletal), is called the epidermal nevus syndrome.  Treatment Treatment once or twice daily with topical calcipotriene may flatten some lesions. The only definitive cure is surgical excision. Vujevich J, Mancini A: The epidermal nevus syndromes: Multisys- tem disorders. J Am Acad Dermatol 2004;50:957 [PMID: 15153903]. 2. Nevus Sebaceus  Clinical Findings This is a hamartoma of sebaceous glands and underlying apocrine glands that is diagnosed by the appearance at birth of a yellowish, hairless plaque in the scalp or on the face. The lesions can be contiguous with an epidermal nevus on the face, and widespread lesions can constitute part of the epidermal nevus syndrome. Histologically, nevus sebaceus represents an overabun- dance of sebaceous glands without hair follicles. At puberty, with androgenic stimulation, the sebaceous cells in the nevus divide, expand their cellular volume, and synthesize sebum, resulting in a warty mass.  Treatment Because 15% of these lesions become basal cell carcino- mas after puberty, excision is recommended before puberty. Terenzi V et al: Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn. Craniofac Surg 2006;17:1234 [PMID: 17119437]. CONNECTIVE TISSUE BIRTHMARKS  (JUVENILE ELASTOMA, COLLAGENOMA)  Clinical Findings Connective tissue nevi are smooth, skin-colored papules 1– 10 mm in diameter that are grouped on the trunk. A solitary, larger (5–10 cm) nodule is called a shagreen patch and is histologically indistinguishable from other connective tissue nevi that show thickened, abundant collagen bundles with or without associated increases of elastic tissue. Although the shagreen patch is a cutaneous clue to tuberous sclerosis (see Chapter 23), the other connective tissue nevi occur as iso- lated events.  Treatment These nevi remain throughout life and need no treatment.

403,"Common Skin Diseases in Infants, Children,  & Adolescents",Poisoning ,1633,"COMMON SKIN DISEASES IN INFANTS,  CHILDREN, & ADOLESCENTS ACNE Acne affects 85% of adolescents. The onset of adolescent acne is between ages 8 and 10 years in 40% of children. The early lesions are usually limited to the face and are primarily closed comedones (whiteheads; see following discussion).  Pathogenesis The primary event in acne formation is obstruction of the sebaceous follicle and subsequent formation of the micro- comedo (not evident clinically). This is the precursor to all future acne lesions. This phenomenon is androgen-depen- dent in adolescent acne. The keratinocytes of the sebaceous follicles contain an enzyme, 5α-reductase, which converts plasma testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This androgen is a potent stimulus for cell proliferation. The four primary factors in the pathogenesis of acne are (1) plugging of the sebaceus follicle; (2) increased sebum production; (3) proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes in the obstructed follicle, and (4) inflammation. Many of these factors are influenced by androgens. Drug-induced acne should be suspected in teenagers if all lesions are in the same stage at the same time and if involvement extends to the lower abdomen, lower back, arms, and legs. Drugs responsible for acne include corti- cotropin (ACTH), glucocorticoids, androgens, hydantoins, and isoniazid, each of which increases plasma testosterone.  Clinical Findings Open comedones are the predominant clinical lesion in early adolescent acne.

Eur J Dermatol 2006;16:349 [PMID: 16935789]. 2. Epidermolysis Bullosa This is a group of heritable disorders characterized by skin fragility with blistering. Depending on the genetic defect, and therefore where the blister occurs, these disorders can be divided into scarring and nonscarring types (Table 14–5). For the severely affected, a good deal of the surface area of the skin may have blisters and erosions, requiring daily wound care and dressings. These children are prone to frequent skin infections, have anemia, growth problems, mouth erosions and esophageal strictures, and chronic pain issues, among many others.  Treatment Treatment consists of protection of the skin with topical emollients as well as nonstick dressings. The other medical needs and potential complications of the severe forms of epidermolysis bullosa require a multidisciplinary approach. For the less severe types, protecting areas of greatest trauma with padding and dressings as well as intermittent topical or oral antibiotics for superinfection are appropriate treat- ments. If hands and feet are involved, reducing skin friction with 5% glutaraldehyde every 3 days is helpful. Lucky AW: Update on epidermolysis bullosa.

403,Acne,Poisoning ,1691,"ACNE Acne affects 85% of adolescents. The onset of adolescent acne is between ages 8 and 10 years in 40% of children. The early lesions are usually limited to the face and are primarily closed comedones (whiteheads; see following discussion).  Pathogenesis The primary event in acne formation is obstruction of the sebaceous follicle and subsequent formation of the micro- comedo (not evident clinically). This is the precursor to all future acne lesions. This phenomenon is androgen-depen- dent in adolescent acne. The keratinocytes of the sebaceous follicles contain an enzyme, 5α-reductase, which converts plasma testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This androgen is a potent stimulus for cell proliferation. The four primary factors in the pathogenesis of acne are (1) plugging of the sebaceus follicle; (2) increased sebum production; (3) proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes in the obstructed follicle, and (4) inflammation. Many of these factors are influenced by androgens. Drug-induced acne should be suspected in teenagers if all lesions are in the same stage at the same time and if involvement extends to the lower abdomen, lower back, arms, and legs. Drugs responsible for acne include corti- cotropin (ACTH), glucocorticoids, androgens, hydantoins, and isoniazid, each of which increases plasma testosterone.  Clinical Findings Open comedones are the predominant clinical lesion in early adolescent acne. The black color is caused not by dirt but by oxidized melanin within the stratum corneum cellular plug. Table 14–5. Types of epidermolysis bullosa.

Up to 10% of patients experience mild, reversible hair loss. Elevated liver enzymes and blood lipids have rarely been described. Acute depression may occur. Isotretinoin is teratogenic in young women of childbearing age. Because of this and the other side effects, it is not recommended unless strict adherence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines is ensured. The FDA has implemented a strict registration program (iPLEDGE) that must be used to obtain isotretinoin. E. Other Acne Treatments Hormonal therapy (oral contraceptives) is often an effective option for girls who have perimenstrual flares of acne or have not responded adequately to conventional therapy. Adolescents with endocrine disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome also see improvement of their acne with hormonal therapy. Oral contraceptives can be added to a conventional therapeutic regimen and should always be used in female patients who are prescribed oral isotretinoin unless absolute contraindications exist. F. Avoidance of Cosmetics and Hair Spray Acne can be aggravated by a variety of external factors that result in further obstruction of partially occluded sebaceous follicles. Discontinuing the use of oil-based cosmetics, face creams, and hair sprays may alleviate the comedonal compo- nent of acne within 4–6 weeks. G. Patient Education and Follow-Up Visits The multifactorial pathogenesis of acne and its role in the treatment plan must be explained to adolescent patients. Time should be set aside at the first visit to answer questions. Acne therapy is aimed at preventing the microcomedone, so therapy takes 8–12 weeks to produce improvement. This delay should be stressed to the patient. Realistic expectations should be encouraged in the adolescent patient because no therapy will prevent an adolescent from ever having another acne lesion. A written education sheet is useful. Follow-up visits should be made every 8–12 weeks. An objective method to chart improvement should be docu- mented by the provider, because patients’ assessment of improvement tends to be inaccurate. Explain again what medications are being used and why, what the treatment is intended to achieve, and that 8–12 weeks of consistent therapy is required for improvement in most cases. Ensure on follow-up that the patient is applying the medication properly (eg, topical keratolytics are to be applied to the entire area of skin that tends to be affected, not to individual lesions already present).

405,Bacterial Infections,Poisoning ,2647,"BACTERIAL INFECTIONS OF THE SKIN 1. Impetigo Erosions covered by honey-colored crusts are diagnostic of impetigo. Staphylococci and group A streptococci are important pathogens in this disease, which histologically consists of superficial invasion of bacteria into the upper epidermis, forming a subcorneal pustule.  Treatment Impetigo should be treated with an antimicrobial agent effective against Staphylococcus aureus (β-lactamase-resistant penicillins or cephalosporins, clindamycin, amoxicillin– clavulanate) for 7–10 days. Topical mupirocin and fusidic acid (three times daily) are also effective. 2. Bullous Impetigo All impetigo is bullous, with the blister forming just beneath the stratum corneum, but in bullous impetigo there is, in addition to the usual erosion covered by a honey-colored crust, a border filled with clear fluid. Staphylococci may be isolated from these lesions, and systemic signs of circulating exfoliatin are absent. Bullous varicella is a disorder that represents bullous impetigo as a superinfection in varicella lesions.  Treatment Treatment with oral antistaphylococcal drugs for 7–10 days is effective. Application of cool compresses to debride crusts is a helpful symptomatic measure. 3. Ecthyma Ecthyma is a firm, dry crust, surrounded by erythema that exudes purulent material. It represents invasion by group A β-hemolytic streptococci through the epidermis to the superficial dermis. This should not be confused with ecthyma gangrenosum. Lesions of ecthyma gangrenosum may be similar in appearance, but they are seen in a severely ill or immunocompromised patient and are due to systemic dissemination of bacteria, usually Pseudomonas aeruginosa, through the bloodstream.  Treatment Treatment is with systemic penicillin. 4. Cellulitis Cellulitis is characterized by erythematous, hot, tender, ill- defined, edematous plaques accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy. Histologically, this disorder represents invasion of microorganisms into the lower dermis and some- times beyond, with obstruction of local lymphatics. Group A β-hemolytic streptococci and coagulase-positive staphylo-   CHAPTER 14 384 cocci are the most common causes; pneumococci and Hae- mophilus influenzae are rare causes. Staphylococcal infec- tions are usually more localized and more likely to have a purulent center; streptococcal infections spread more rap- idly, but these characteristics cannot be used to specify the infecting agent. An entry site of prior trauma or infection (eg, varicella) is often present. Septicemia is a potential complication.  Treatment Treatment is with an appropriate systemic antibiotic. 5. Folliculitis A pustule at a follicular opening represents folliculitis. If the pustule occurs at eccrine sweat orifices, it is correctly called poritis. Staphylococci and streptococci are the most frequent pathogens.  Treatment Treatment consists of measures to remove follicular obstruc- tion—either cool, wet compresses for 24 hours or keratolyt- ics such as those used for acne. 6. Abscess An abscess occurs deep in the skin, at the bottom of a follicle or an apocrine gland, and is diagnosed as an erythematous, firm, acutely tender nodule with ill-defined borders. Staphy- lococci are the most common organisms.  Treatment Treatment consists of incision and drainage and systemic antibiotics. 7. Scalded Skin Syndrome This entity consists of the sudden onset of bright red, acutely painful skin, most obvious periorally, periorbitally, and in the flexural areas of the neck, the axillae, the popliteal and antecubital areas, and the groin. The slightest pressure on the skin results in severe pain and separation of the epidermis, leaving a glistening layer (the stratum granulosum of the epidermis) beneath. The disease is caused by a circulating toxin (exfoliatin) elaborated by phage group II staphylo- cocci. Exfoliatin binds to desmoglein-1 resulting in a separa- tion of cells in the granular layer. The causative staphylococci may be isolated not from the skin but rather from the nasopharynx, an abscess, sinus, blood culture, and so on.  Treatment Treatment is with systemic antistaphylococcal drugs.

406,Fungal Infections,Critical Care ,2301,"FUNGAL INFECTIONS OF THE SKIN 1. Dermatophyte Infections Dermatophytes become attached to the superficial layer of the epidermis, nails, and hair, where they proliferate. They grow mainly within the stratum corneum and do not invade the lower epidermis or dermis. Release of toxins from dermatophytes—especially those whose natural hosts are animals or soil, for example, Microsporum canis and Trichophyton verrucosum—results in dermatitis. Fun- gal infection should be suspected with any red and scaly lesion.  Classification & Clinical Findings A. Tinea Capitis Thickened, broken-off hairs with erythema and scaling of underlying scalp are the distinguishing features (Table 14–7). In endemic ringworm, hairs are broken off at the surface of the scalp, leaving a “black dot” appearance. Pustule formation and a boggy, fluctuant mass on the scalp occur in M canis and T tonsurans infections. This mass, called a kerion, represents an exaggerated host response to the organism. Diffuse scaling of the scalp may also be seen. Fungal culture should be performed in all cases of sus- pected tinea capitis. B. Tinea Corporis Tinea corporis presents either as annular marginated plaques with a thin scale and clear center or as an annular confluent dermatitis. The most common organisms are Trichophyton mentagrophytes and M canis. The diagnosis is made by scraping thin scales from the border of the lesion, dissolving them in 20% KOH, and examining for hyphae. Table 14–7. Clinical features of tinea capitis. Most Common  Organisms Clinical Appearance Microscopic  Appearance in KOH Trichophyton  tonsurans  (90%) Hairs broken off 2–3 mm  from follicle; “black dot”;  diffuse pustule; sebor- rheic dermatitis-like; no  fluorescence Hyphae and spores  within hair Microsporum  canis (10%) Thickened broken-off hairs  that fluoresce yellow- green with Wood’s lamp Small spores out- side of hair; hyphae  within hair   SKIN 385 C. Tinea Cruris Symmetrical, sharply marginated lesions in inguinal areas occur with tinea cruris. The most common organisms are Trichophy- ton rubrum, T mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum. D. Tinea Pedis The diagnosis of tinea pedis is becoming more common in the prepubertal child, although it is still most commonly seen in postpubertal males. Presentation is with red scaly soles, blis- ters on the instep of the foot, or fissuring between the toes. E. Tinea Unguium (Onychomycosis) Loosening of the nail plate from the nail bed (onycholysis), giving a yellow discoloration, is the first sign of fungal invasion of the nails. Thickening of the distal nail plate then occurs, followed by scaling and a crumbly appearance of the entire nail plate surface. T rubrum and T mentagrophytes are the most common causes. The diagnosis is confirmed by KOH examination and fungal culture. Usually only one or two nails are involved. If every nail is involved, psoriasis, lichen planus, or idiopathic trachyonychia is a more likely diagnosis than fungal infection.  Treatment The treatment of dermatophytosis is quite simple: If hair is involved, griseofulvin is the treatment of choice. Topical antifungal agents do not enter hair or nails in sufficient concentration to clear the infection. The absorption of griseofulvin from the gastrointestinal tract is enhanced by a fatty meal; thus, whole milk or ice cream taken with the medication increases absorption. The dosage of griseofulvin is 20 mg/kg/d. With hair infections, cultures should be done every 4 weeks, and treatment should be continued for 4 weeks following a negative culture result. The side effects are few, and the drug has been used successfully in the newborn period. Itraconazole and terbinafine have been used when response to griseofulvin is unsatisfactory. For nails, daily administration of topical ciclopirox 8% (Penlac nail lacquer) can be considered, as can pulsed-dose itraconazole given in three 1-week pulses separated by 3 weeks. Tinea corporis, tinea pedis, and tinea cruris can be treated effectively with topical medication after careful inspection to make certain that the hair and nails are not involved. Treat- ment with any of the imidazoles, allylamines, benzylamines, or ciclopirox applied twice daily for 3–4 weeks is recommended. Gupta AK et al: Dermatophytosis: The management of fungal infections. Skinmed 2005;4:305 [PMID: 16282753]. 2. Tinea Versicolor Tinea versicolor is a superficial infection caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also called Malassezia furfur), a yeastlike fungus. It characteristically causes polycyclic connected hypopigmented macules and very fine scales in areas of sun-induced pigmenta- tion. In winter, the polycyclic macules appear reddish brown.  Treatment Treatment consists of application of selenium sulfide (Sel- sun), 2.5% suspension, or topical antifungals. Selenium sulfide should be applied to the whole body and left on overnight. Treatment can be repeated again in 1 week and then monthly thereafter. It tends to be somewhat irritating, and the patient should be warned about this difficulty. 3. Candida albicans Infections  (See also Chapter 39)  Clinical Findings In addition to being a frequent invader in diaper dermatitis, Candida albicans also infects the oral mucosa, where it appears as thick white patches with an erythematous base (thrush); the angles of the mouth, where it causes fissures and white exudate (perlêche); and the cuticular region of the fingers, where thickening of the cuticle, dull red erythema, and distortion of growth of the nail plate suggest the diagnosis of candidal paronychia. Candida dermatitis is characterized by sharply defined erythematous patches, sometimes with eroded areas. Pustules, vesicles, or papules may be present as satellite lesions. Similar infections may be found in other moist areas, such as the axillae and neck folds. This infection is more common in children who have recently received antibiotics.  Treatment A topical imidazole cream is the drug of first choice for C albicans infections. In diaper dermatitis, the cream form can be applied every 8–12 hours. In oral thrush, nystatin suspen- sion should be applied directly to the mucosa with the parent’s finger or a cotton-tipped applicator, because it is not absorbed and acts topically. In candidal paronychia, the antifungal agent is applied over the area, covered with occlusive plastic wrapping, and left on overnight after the application is made airtight. Refractory candidiasis will respond to a brief course of oral fluconazole. Kyle AA, Dahl MV: Topical therapy for fungal infections. Am J Clin Dermatol 2004;5:443 [PMID: 15663341]. "
407,Viral Infections,Critical Care ,4708,"VIRAL INFECTIONS OF THE SKIN  (SEE ALSO CHAPTER 38) 1. Herpes Simplex Infection  Clinical Findings Painful, grouped vesicles or erosions on a red base suggest herpes simplex. Rapid immunofluorescent tests for herpes sim- plex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are available. A Tzanck smear is done by scraping a vesicle base with a No. 15   SKIN 387 with prolonged freeze times and too much pressure applied with a cotton applicator can lead to blistering and scarring. The patient should be seen at treatment intervals of 2–3 weeks. Longer times between treatments result in lower efficacy. Topical salicylic acid, topical imiquimod, and oral cimetidine may also be used. Large mosaic plantar warts are treated most effectively by applying 40% salicylic acid plaster cut with a scissors to fit the lesion. The adhesive side of the plaster is placed against the lesion and taped securely in place with duct or athletic tape. The plaster and tape should be placed on Monday and removed on Friday. Over the week- end, the patient should soak the skin in warm water for 30 minutes to soften it. Then the white, macerated tissue should be pared with a pumice stone, cuticle scissors, or a nail file. This procedure is repeated every week, and the patient is seen every 4 weeks. Most plantar warts resolve in 6–8 weeks when treated in this way. Vascular pulsed dye lasers are a useful adjunct therapy for the treatment of plantar warts. For flat warts, a good response to 0.05% tretinoin cream or topical imiquimod (Aldara) cream, applied once daily for 3–4 weeks, has been reported. Surgical excision, electrosurgery, and nonspecific burn- ing laser surgery should be avoided; these modalities do not have higher cure rates and result in scarring. Venereal warts (condylomata acuminata) (see Chapter 42) may be treated with imiquimod, 25% podophyllum resin (podophyllin) in alcohol, or podofilox, a lower concentra- tion of purified podophyllin, which is applied at home. Podophyllin should be painted on the lesions in the practi- tioner’s office and then washed off after 4 hours. Re-treat- ment in 2–3 weeks may be necessary. Podofilox is applied by the patient once daily, Monday through Thursday, whereas imiquimod is used 3 times a week on alternating days. Lesions not on the vulvar mucous membrane but on the adjacent skin should be treated as a common wart and frozen. No wart therapy is immediately and definitively success- ful. Realistic expectations should be set and appropriate follow-up treatments scheduled. Keogh-Brown MR et al: To freeze or not to freeze: A cost- effectiveness analysis of wart treatment.

409,Insect Infestations,Critical Care ,2327,"INSECT INFESTATIONS 1. Scabies  Clinical Findings Scabies is suggested by linear burrows about the wrists, ankles, finger webs, areolas, anterior axillary folds, genitalia, or face (in infants). Often there are excoriations, honey- colored crusts, and pustules from secondary infection. Iden- tification of the female mite or her eggs and feces is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Scrape an unscratched papule or burrow with a No. 15 blade and examine microscopically in immersion oil to confirm the diagnosis. In a child who is often scratching, scrape under the fingernails. Examine the parents for unscratched burrows.  Treatment Permethrin 5% is now the treatment of choice for scabies. It should be applied as a single overnight application. The need for re-treatment is rare. Karthikeyan K: Scabies in children. Arch Dis Child Educ Pract Ed 2007;92:ep65 [PMID: 17517973]. 2. Pediculoses (Louse Infestations)  Clinical Findings The presence of excoriated papules and pustules and a history of severe itching at night suggest infestation with the human body louse. This louse may be discovered in the seams of underwear but not on the body. In the scalp hair, the gelatinous nits of the head louse adhere tightly to the hair shaft. The pubic louse may be found crawling among pubic hairs, or blue-black macules may be found dispersed through the pubic region (maculae cerulea). The pubic louse is often seen on the eyelashes of newborns.  Treatment Initial treatment of head lice is often instituted by parents with an over-the-counter pyrethrin or permethrin product. If head lice are not eradicated after two applications 7 days apart with these products, 5% permethrin should be used. Malathion 0.5% is highly effective but is toxic if ingested, and flammable. Lebwohl M et al: Therapy for head lice based on life cycle, resistance, and safety. Pediatrics 2007;119:965 [PMID: 17473098]. 3. Papular Urticaria  Clinical Findings Papular urticaria is characterized by grouped erythematous papules surrounded by an urticarial flare and distributed over the shoulders, upper arms, and buttocks in infants. Although not a true infestation, these lesions represent delayed hypersen- sitivity reactions to stinging or biting insects and can be reproduced by patch testing with the offending insect. Fleas from dogs and cats are the usual offenders. Less commonly, mosquitoes, lice, scabies, and bird and grass mites are involved. The sensitivity is transient, lasting 4–6 months. Usually no other family members are affected. It is often difficult for the parents to understand why no one else is affected.  Treatment The logical therapy is to remove the offending insect, although in most cases it is very difficult to identify the exact   CHAPTER 14 388 cause.

410,Dermatitis (Eczema),Critical Care ,264,"DERMATITIS (ECZEMA) The terms dermatitis and eczema are currently used inter- changeably in dermatology, although the term eczema truly denotes an acute weeping dermatosis. All forms of dermati- tis, regardless of cause, may present with acute edema, erythema, and oozing with crusting, mild erythema alone, or lichenification. Lichenification is diagnosed by thickening of the skin with a shiny surface and exaggerated, deepened skin markings. It is the response of the skin to chronic rubbing or scratching. Although the lesions of the various dermatoses are histo- logically indistinguishable, clinicians have nonetheless divided the disease group called dermatitis into several categories based on known causes in some cases and differing natural histories in others. 1. Atopic Dermatitis  Pathogenesis & Clinical Findings Atopic dermatitis is a general term for chronic superficial inflammation of the skin that can be applied to a heteroge- neous group of patients. Many (not all) patients go through three clinical phases. In the first, infantile eczema, the der- matitis begins on the cheeks and scalp and frequently expresses itself as oval patches on the trunk, later involving the extensor surfaces of the extremities. The usual age at onset is 2–3 months, and this phase ends at age 18 months to 2 years. Only one third of all infants with infantile eczema progress to phase 2 childhood or flexural eczema in which the predominant involvement is in the antecubital and popliteal fossae, the neck, the wrists, and sometimes the hands or feet. This phase lasts from age 2 years to adoles- cence. Some children have involvement only of the soles of the feet, with cracking, redness, and pain, so-called atopic feet. Only one third of children with typical flexural eczema progress to adolescent eczema, which is usually manifested by the continuation of chronic flexural eczema alone with hand dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is quite unusual after age 30 years. Atopic dermatitis results from an interaction among susceptibility genes, the host environment, skin barrier defects, pharmacologic abnormalities, and immunologic response. The case for food and inhalant allergens as specific causes of atopic dermatitis is not strong. There is significant new evidence that the primary defect in atopic dermatitis is an abnormality in the skin barrier formation due to defects in the filaggrin gene. A few patients with atopic dermatitis have immunodefi- ciency with recurrent pyodermas, unusual susceptibility to herpes simplex viruses, hyperimmunoglobulinemia E, defec- tive neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, and impaired T- lymphocyte function. (See Chapter 31.) A faulty epidermal barrier predisposes the patient with atopic dermatitis to dry, itchy skin. Inability to hold water within the stratum corneum results in rapid evaporation of water, shrinking of the stratum corneum, and cracks in the epidermal barrier. Such skin forms an ineffective barrier to the entry of various irritants—and, indeed, it may be clini- cally useful to regard atopic dermatitis as a primary-irritant contact dermatitis and simply tell the patient, “you have sensitive skin.” Chronic atopic dermatitis is frequently infected secondarily with S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Patients with atopic dermatitis have a deficiency of antimi- crobial peptides in their skin, which may account for the susceptibility to recurrent skin infection.  Treatment A. Acute Stages Application of wet dressings and topical corticosteroids is the treatment of choice for acute, weeping atopic eczema. A topical steroid preparation is applied two times daily and covered with wet dressings as outlined at the beginning of this chapter. Superinfection or colonization with S aureus is common, and appropriate systemic antibiotics may be nec- essary. If the expected improvement is not seen, bacterial cultures should be obtained to identify the possibility of an organism resistant to standard therapy. B. Chronic Stages Treatment is aimed at avoiding irritants and restoring water to the skin. No soaps or harsh shampoos should be used, and the patient should avoid woolen or any rough clothing. Bathing is minimized to every second or third day. Twice- daily lubrication of the skin is very important. Nonperfumed lotions or creams are suitable lubricants. Plain petrolatum is an acceptable lubricant, but some people find it too greasy and during hot weather it may also cause considerable sweat retention. Liberal use of Cetaphil lotion four or five times daily as a substitute for soap is also satisfactory as a means of lubrication. A bedroom humidifier is often helpful. Topical corticosteroids should be limited to medium strength (see Table 14–3). There is never any reason to use super- or high-potency corticosteroids in atopic dermatitis. In superinfected atopic dermatitis, systemic anti- biotics for 10–14 days are necessary. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus ointments are topical immunosuppressive agents that are effective in atopic derma- titis. Due to concerns about the development of malignan- cies, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus should be reserved for children older than 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis unresponsive to medium-potency topical steroids. It has been   CHAPTER 14 390 Seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp in infancy is clinically similar to atopic dermatitis, and the distinction may become clear only after other areas are involved. Psoriasis also occurs in seborrheic areas in older children and should be consid- ered in the differential diagnosis.  Treatment Seborrheic dermatitis responds well to low-potency topical corticosteroids. Schwartz RA et al: Seborrheic dermatitis: An overview. Am Fam Physician 2006;74:125 [PMID: 16848386]. 6. Dandruff Dandruff is physiologic scaling or mild seborrhea, in the form of greasy scalp scales. The cause is unknown. Treat- ment is with medicated dandruff shampoos. 7. Dry Skin Dermatitis  (Asteatotic Eczema, Xerosis) Newborns and older children who live in arid climates are susceptible to dry skin, characterized by large cracked scales with erythematous borders. The stratum corneum is depen- dent on environmental humidity for its water, and below 30% environmental humidity the stratum corneum loses water, shrinks, and cracks. These cracks in the epidermal barrier allow irritating substances to enter the skin, predis- posing the patient to dermatitis.  Treatment Treatment consists of increasing the water content of the skin in the immediate external environment. House humid- ifiers are very useful. Minimize bathing to every second or third day. Frequent soaping of the skin impairs its water-holding capacity and serves as an irritating alkali, and all soaps should therefore be avoided. Frequent use of emollients (eg, Cetaphil, Eucerin, Lubriderm) should be a major part of therapy. 8. Keratosis Pilaris Follicular papules containing a white inspissated scale charac- terize keratosis pilaris. Individual lesions are discrete and may be red. They are prominent on the extensor surfaces of the upper arms and thighs and on the buttocks and cheeks. In severe cases, the lesions may be generalized. Such lesions are seen frequently in children with dry skin and have also been associated with atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis vulgaris.  Treatment Treatment is with keratolytics such as urea cream or lactic acid, followed by skin hydration. 9. Pityriasis Alba White, scaly macular areas with indistinct borders are seen over extensor surfaces of extremities and on the cheeks in children with pityriasis alba. Suntanning exaggerates these lesions. Histologic examination reveals a mild dermatitis. These lesions may be confused with tinea versicolor.  Treatment Low-potency topical corticosteroids may help decrease any inflammatory component and may lead to faster return of normal pigmentation.

412,Common Skin Tumors,Critical Care ,2679,"COMMON SKIN TUMORS If the skin moves with the nodule on lateral palpation, the tumor is located within the dermis; if the skin moves over the nodule, it is subcutaneous. Seventy-five percent of lumps in childhood will be either epidermoid cysts (60%) or piloma- trichomas (15%). 1. Epidermoid Cysts  Clinical Findings Epidermoid cysts are the most common type of cutaneous cyst. Other names for epidermoid cysts are epidermal cysts, epidermal inclusion cysts, and “sebaceous” cysts. This last term is a misnomer since they contain neither sebum nor sebaceous glands. Epidermoid cysts can occur anywhere, but are most common on the face and upper trunk. They usually arise from and are lined by the stratified squamous epithelium of the follicular infundibulum. Clinically, epidermoid cysts are dermal nodules with a central punctum, representing the follicle associated with the cyst. They can reach several centi- meters in diameter. Dermoid cysts are areas of sequestration of skin along embryonic fusion lines. They are present at birth and occur most commonly on the lateral eyebrow.  Treatment Epidermoid cysts can rupture, causing a foreign-body inflammatory reaction, or become infected. Infectious com- plications should be treated with antibiotics and drainage. Definitive treatment is surgical excision. Treatment of der- moid cysts, if desired, is surgical excision. 2. Pilomatrichomas These are benign tumors of the hair matrix. They are most commonly seen on the face and upper trunk. They are firm and may be irregular. Their color varies from flesh-colored to pink or blue. The firmness is secondary to calcification of the tumor.   SKIN 391  Treatment Treatment is by surgical excision. 3. Granuloma Annulare Circles or semicircles of nontender intradermal nodules found over the lower legs and ankles, the dorsum of the hands and wrists, and the trunk, in that order of frequency, suggest granuloma annulare. Histologically, the disease appears as a central area of tissue death (necrobiosis) sur- rounded by macrophages and lymphocytes.  Treatment No treatment is necessary. Lesions resolve spontaneously within 1–2 years in most children. 4. Pyogenic Granuloma These lesions appear over 1–2 weeks following skin trauma as a dark red papule with an ulcerated and crusted surface that may bleed easily even with minor trauma. Histologi- cally, this represents excessive new vessel formation with or without inflammation (granulation tissue). It should be regarded as an abnormal healing response.  Treatment Pulsed dye laser for very small lesions or curettage followed by electrocautery are the treatments of choice. 5. Keloids Keloids are scars of delayed onset that continue for up to several years to progress beyond the initial wound margins. The tendency to develop keloids is inherited. They are often found on the face, earlobes, neck, chest, and back.  Treatment Treatment includes intralesional injection with triamcino- lone acetonide, 20 mg/mL, or excision and injection with corticosteroids.

413,Papulosquamous Eruptions,Critical Care ,1469,"PAPULOSQUAMOUS ERUPTIONS Papulosquamous eruptions (Table 14–8) comprise papules or plaques with varying degrees of scale. 1. Pityriasis Rosea  Pathogenesis & Clinical Findings Pink to red, oval plaques with fine scales that tend to align with their long axis parallel to skin tension lines (eg, “Christ- mas tree pattern” on the back) are characteristic lesions of pityriasis rosea. In 20–80% of cases the generalized eruption is preceded for up to 30 days by a solitary, larger, scaling plaque with central clearing and a scaly border (the herald patch). The herald patch is clinically similar to ringworm and can be confused. In whites, the lesions are primarily on the trunk; in blacks, lesions are primarily on the extremities and may be accentuated in the axillary and inguinal areas. This disease is common in school-aged children and adolescents and is presumed to be viral in origin. The role of human herpesvirus 7 in the pathogenesis of pityriasis rosea is debated. The condition lasts 6 weeks and may be pruritic.  Differential Diagnosis The major differential diagnosis is secondary syphilis, and a VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratories) test should be done if syphilis is suspected, especially in high-risk patients with palm or sole involvement.  Treatment Exposure to natural sunlight may help hasten the resolution of lesions. Oral antihistamines can be used for pruritus. Often, no treatment is necessary. Pityriasis rosea that lasts more than 12 weeks should be referred to a dermatologist for evaluation.

Psoriasis  Pathogenesis & Clinical Findings Psoriasis is characterized by erythematous papules covered by thick white scales. Guttate (droplike) psoriasis is a common form in children that often follows an episode of streptococcal pharyngitis by 2–3 weeks. The sudden onset of small papules (3–8 mm), seen predominantly over the trunk and quickly covered with thick white scales, is characteristic of guttate psoriasis. Chronic psoriasis is marked by thick, large scaly plaques (5–10 cm) over the elbows, knees, scalp, and other sites of trauma. Pinpoint pits in the nail plate are seen, as well as yellow discoloration of the nail plate resulting from ony- Table 14–8. Papulosquamous eruptions in children. Psoriasis Pityriasis rosea Tinea corporis Lichen planus Pityriasis lichenoides (acute or chronic) Dermatomyositis Lupus erythematosus Pityriasis rubra pilaris Secondary syphilis   CHAPTER 14 392 cholysis. Psoriasis occurs frequently on the scalp, elbows, knees, periumbilical area, ears, sacral area, and genitalia. It should always be included in the differential diagnosis of “dermatitis” on the scalp or genitalia of children. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is complex and incom- pletely understood. It is a familial condition, and multiple psoriasis susceptibility genes have been identified. There is increased epidermal turnover; psoriatic epidermis has a turnover time of 3–4 days versus 28 days for normal skin. These rapidly proliferating epidermal cells produce excessive stratum corneum, giving rise to thick, opaque scales.  Differential Diagnosis Papulosquamous eruptions that present problems of differ- ential diagnosis are listed in Table 14–8.  Treatment Topical corticosteroids are the initial treatment of choice. Penetration of topical steroids through the enlarged epider- mal barrier in psoriasis requires that more potent prepara- tions be used, for example, fluocinonide 0.05% (Lidex) or clobetasol 0.05% (Temovate) ointment twice daily. The second line of therapy is topical calcipotriene (Dovonex) applied twice daily or the combination of a superpotent topical steroid twice daily on weekends and calcipotriene twice daily on weekdays for 8 weeks. Topical retinoids such as tazarotene (0.1%, 0.5% cream, gel) can be used in combination with topical corticosteroids to help restore normal epidermal differentiation and turnover time. However, these treatments can cause skin to become dry. Anthralin therapy is also useful. Anthralin is applied to the skin for a short contact time (eg, 20 minutes once daily) and then washed off with a neutral soap (eg, Dove). A 6-week course of treatment is recommended. This can be used in combination with topical corticosteroids. Crude coal tar therapy is messy and stains bedclothes. The newer tar gels (Estar, PsoriGel) cause less staining and are most efficacious. They are applied twice daily for 6–8 weeks. These preparations are sold over the counter and are not usually covered by insurance plans. Scalp care using a tar shampoo requires leaving the shampoo on for 5 minutes, washing it off, and then sham- pooing with commercial shampoo to remove scales. It may be necessary to shampoo daily until scaling is reduced. More severe cases of psoriasis are best treated by a dermatologist.

414,Hair Loss,Critical Care ,2574,"HAIR LOSS (ALOPECIA) Hair loss in children (Table 14–9) imposes great emotional stress on the patient and the parent. A 60% hair loss in a single area is necessary before hair loss can be detected clinically. Examination should begin with the scalp to deter- mine whether inflammation, scale, or infiltrative changes are present. Hairs should be examined microscopically for breaking and structural defects and to see whether growing or resting hairs are being shed. Placing removed hairs in mounting fluid (Permount) on a glass microscope slide makes them easy to examine. Three diseases account for most cases of hair loss in children: alopecia areata, tinea capitis (described earlier in this chapter), and hair pulling. Silverberg NB: Helping children cope with hair loss. Cutis 2006;78:333 [PMID: 17186792]. 1. Alopecia Areata  Clinical Findings Loss of every hair in a localized area is called alopecia areata. This is the most common cause of hair loss in children. An immunologic pathogenic mechanism is suspected because dense infiltration of lymphocytes precedes hair loss. Ninety- five percent of children with alopecia areata completely regrow their hair within 12 months, although as many as 40% may have a relapse in 5–6 years. A rare and unusual form of alopecia areata begins at the occiput and proceeds along the hair margins to the frontal scalp. This variety, called ophiasis, often eventuates in total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis). The prognosis for regrowth in ophiasis is poor.  Treatment Treatment of alopecia areata is difficult. Systemic corticoster- oids given to suppress the inflammatory response will result in hair growth, but the hair may fall out again when the drug is discontinued. Systemic corticosteroids should never be used Table 14–9. Other causes of hair loss in children.

The child must experience equally good visual inputs from well-aligned eyes during this period while the visual nervous system is still exhibiting plasticity. Thus, pediatric ophthalmology emphasizes early diagno- sis and treatment of pediatric eye diseases in order to obtain the best possible visual outcome. But eye disease in children does not always originate in the ocular system. Abnormal eye findings in a child may be a sign of systemic disease. "
417,Common Nonspecific Signs & Symptoms,Critical Care ,565,"COMMON NONSPECIFIC  SIGNS & SYMPTOMS Nonspecific signs and symptoms commonly occur as the chief complaint or as an element of the history of a child with eye disease. Five of these findings are described here, along with a sixth—leukocoria—which is less common, but often has serious implications. Do not hesitate to seek the help of a pediatric ophthalmologist when you believe the diagnosis and treatment of these signs and symptoms requires in-depth clinical experience. REDNESS Redness (injection) of the bulbar conjunctiva or deeper vessels is a common presenting complaint. It may be mild and localized or diffuse and bilateral. Causes include superficial or penetrating foreign bodies, infection, allergy, and conjunctivitis associated with systemic enti- ties such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Kawasaki disease. Irritating noxious agents also cause injection. Subconjunctival hemorrhage may be traumatic or spon- taneous or may be associated with hematopoietic disease, vascular anomalies, or inflammatory processes. Uncom- monly, an injected eye can be due to an intraocular or orbital tumor. TEARING Tearing in infants is usually due to nasolacrimal obstruc- tion but may also be associated with congenital glaucoma, in which case photophobia and blepharospasm may also be present. Inflammation, allergic and viral diseases, or con- junctival and corneal irritation can also cause tearing. DISCHARGE Purulent discharge is usually associated with bacterial con- junctivitis. In infants and toddlers with nasolacrimal obstruction, a mucopurulent discharge may be present with low-grade, chronic dacryocystitis. Watery discharge occurs with viral infection, iritis, superficial foreign bodies, and nasolacrimal obstruction. Mucoid discharge may be a sign of allergic conjunctivitis or nasolacrimal obstruction. A mucoid discharge due to allergy typically contains eosin- ophils; a purulent bacterial discharge contains polymor- phonuclear leukocytes. PAIN & FOREIGN BODY SENSATION Pain in or around the eye may be due to foreign bodies, corneal abrasions, lacerations, acute infections of the globe or ocular adnexa, iritis, and angle-closure glaucoma. Large refractive errors, poor accommodative ability, and sinus dis- ease may manifest as headaches. Trichiasis (inturned lashes) and contact lens problems also cause ocular discomfort. PHOTOPHOBIA Acute aversion to light may occur with corneal abrasions, foreign bodies, and iritis. Squinting of one eye in bright light is a common sign of intermittent exotropia. Photophobia is present in infants with glaucoma, albinism, aniridia, and retinal dystrophies such as achromatopsia. Photophobia is common after ocular surgery and after dilation of the pupil with mydriatic and cycloplegic agents. Photophobia in indi-  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

LEUKOCORIA Although not a common sign or complaint, leukocoria (a white pupil) is associated with serious diseases and requires prompt ophthalmologic consultation. Causes of leukocoria include retinoblastoma, retinopathy of prematurity, pupillary membrane, cataract, vitreous opacities, retinal detachment, Toxocara infection, and retinal dysplasia (Figure 15–1). "
418,Refractive Errors,Critical Care ,491,"REFRACTIVE ERRORS Refractive error refers to the optical state of the eye (Figure 15–2). It is a physical characteristic like height or weight and can be quantitated. Not all refractive errors require correction, but severe errors can cause amblyopia (reduced vision with or without an organic lesion). Those that do can usually be corrected with glasses. Less often, contact lenses are required, usually for very high or asymmetrical refractive errors, or for adolescents who do not want to wear spectacles. Laser refrac- tive surgery is not currently indicated for most children. There are three common refractive errors: myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Inequality of the refractive state between the two eyes (anisometropia) can cause amblyopia. Children at partic- ular risk for refractive errors requiring correction with specta- cles include those who were born prematurely, those with Down syndrome, those who are offspring of parents with refractive errors, and those who have certain systemic condi- tions such as Stickler, Marfan, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. MYOPIA (NEARSIGHTEDNESS) For the myopic or nearsighted individual, objects nearby are in focus; those at a distance are blurred. This is because the plane of focus is anterior to the retina. The onset is typically at about age 8 years and may progress throughout adolescence and young adulthood. A myopic person may squint to pro- duce a pinhole effect, which improves distance vision. Diver- gent lenses provide clear distance vision. Many studies have been done attempting to slow or stop myopic progression. Atropine eye drops have shown some effect, but produce many side effects. A newer drug, pirenzepine, has shown promise in animal studies, and human studies are underway. Tan DT et al, and Asian Pirenzepine Study Group: One-year multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel safety and efficacy study of 2% pirenzepine ophthalmic gel in children with myopia. Ophthalmology 2005;112:84 [PMID: 15629825]. HYPEROPIA (FARSIGHTEDNESS) Saying that the hyperopic child is sighted for far (not near) vision is somewhat misleading, because the child can focus on near objects if the hyperopia is not excessive. Large amounts of uncorrected hyperopia can cause esotropia (inward deviation, or crossing, of the eyes) and amblyopia (see later section on Amblyopia & Strabismus). Most infants have a hyperopic refraction that begins to diminish during the toddler years and does not require correction. ▲ Figure 15–1. Leukocoria of the left eye caused by  retrolental membrane (persistent hyperplastic primary  vitreous or persistent fetal vasculature).   ▲ Figure 15–2. Different refractive states of the eye.  A: Emmetropia. Image plane from parallel rays of light  falls on retina. B: Myopia. Image plane focuses anterior  to retina. C: Hyperopia. Image plane focuses posterior to  retina. D: Astigmatism, myopic type. Images in horizontal  and vertical planes focus anterior to retina. E: Astigma- tism, hyperopic type. Images in horizontal and vertical  planes focus posterior to retina. F: Astigmatism, mixed  type. Images in horizontal and vertical planes focus on  either side of retina.  A C E F D B   EYE 397 ASTIGMATISM When either the cornea or the crystalline lens is not perfectly spherical, an image will not be sharply focused in one plane. Schematically, there will be two planes of focus. Both of the planes can be either in front of or behind the retina, or one of the planes can be in front of the retina and the other behind it. This refractive state is described as astigmatism. Large amounts of astigmatism not corrected at an early age can cause decreased vision from amblyopia, but proper refractive correction can prevent this.

419,Ophthalmic Examination,Critical Care ,728,"Ophthalmic examination of the pediatric patient begins with a calm demeanor and reassuring voice. Having a parent present is invaluable. The examination includes a history, assessment of visual acuity, external examination, observa- tion of ocular alignment and motility, and ophthalmoscopic examination. Intraocular pressure is less frequently meas- ured. Testing of binocular status and near point is desirable when age and cooperation permit. Circumstances will dictate the use of ancillary procedures such as instilling fluorescein dye and radiologic tests (mag- netic resonance imaging [MRI] and computed tomography [CT] scan). Electroretinography and electrooculography test retinal function. Visual evoked response testing assesses the function of the cortical visual pathways. Visual field testing demonstrates the presence or absence of scotomas and visual field defects occurring anywhere along the visual pathway. In the office setting, visual field testing may be done in a gross manner (confrontation) by bringing an object from the periphery of the child’s field of vision into each of four quadrants or by having an older child count the examiner’s fingers as they are presented in two quadrants simulta- neously, but accurate results can be difficult to achieve in young children. HISTORY Evaluation begins by ascertaining the chief complaint and taking a history of the present illness. Elements of the history include onset of the complaint, its duration, whether it is monocular or binocular, treatment received thus far, and associated systemic symptoms. If an infectious disease is suspected, ask about possible contact with others having similar findings. The ocular history is obtained, as is the perinatal and developmental history and any history of allergy. The family history should be explored for ocular disorders that may be familial. VISUAL ACUITY Visual acuity testing is the single most important test of visual function and should be part of every general physical examination. This is the nonophthalmologist’s most defini- tive test for amblyopia, refractive errors, and lesions along the optic pathways. Acuity should be tested in each eye individually, using an adhesive eye patch to prevent peeking. Glasses should be worn during vision screening if they have been prescribed in the past. In older children who can cooperate, use of a pinhole will improve vision in children not wearing the appropriate spectacle prescription. Vision Screening Vision screening in the pediatric age group is a challenge, especially in younger and developmentally delayed children. Accuracy of the screening test being administered to a particular population and expense in terms of time, equip- ment, and personnel are some factors that must be consid- ered. Vision screening is consistent with the recommenda- tions of the American Academy of Pediatrics (http:// www.aap.org). Risk factors that should be screened for because they interfere with normal visual development and are amblyogenic include media opacities, strabismus, and refractive errors that are different in the two eyes (aniso- metropia) or of large magnitude in both eyes. The type of test used to determine visual acuity is dictated by the child’s age. In the sleeping newborn, the presence of a blepharospastic response to bright light is an adequate response. At age 6 weeks, eye-to-eye contact with slow following movements is becoming established and can be detected. By age 3 months, the infant should demonstrate fixing and following ocular movements for objects at a distance of 2–3 feet. At age 6 months, interest in movement across the room is the norm. Vision can be recorded for the presence or absence of fixing and following behavior and whether vision is steady (unsteady when nystagmus is present) and maintained. Vision should be tested and recorded for each eye. Visual acuity can be quantified in infants using other techniques, such as the 15-diopter prism test, preferential looking technique, or the pattern visual evoked response. In the verbal child, the use of familiar icons will allow for a quantitative test. Allen or Lea symbols with familiar pic- tures can be used to test children younger than 2–3 years of age. When it is not possible to measure visual acuity or assess alignment in the preschool-aged group, random dot stereop- sis testing (for depth perception) is effective in screening for manifest strabismus and amblyopia, but this test may miss some cases of anisometropic (unequal refractive error) amblyopia and small-angle strabismus. This test is not designed to detect refractive errors. Four-year-old children are often ready to play the tum- bling E game (in which the child identifies the orientation of the letter E, which is turned in one of four directions) or the    CHAPTER 15 400 an attack of closed-angle glaucoma in the predisposed adult, children are very rarely predisposed to angle closure. Exceptions include those with a dislocated lens, past sur- gery, or an eye previously compromised by a retrolental membrane, such as in retinopathy of prematurity. There- fore, if an adequate view of the fundus is precluded by a miotic pupil, use of a dilating agent (eg, 1 drop in each eye of 2.5% phenylephrine or 0.5% or 1% tropicamide) should provide adequate mydriasis (dilation). In infants, 1 drop of a combination of 1% phenylephrine with 0.2% cyclo- pentolate (Cyclomydril) is safer. Structures to be observed during ophthalmoscopy include the optic disk, blood vessels, the macular reflex, and retina, as well as the clarity of the vitreous media. By increasing the amount of plus lens dialed into the instrument, the point of focus moves anteriorly from the retina to the lens and finally to the cornea. Ophthalmoscopy should include assessment of the clarity of the ocular media, that is, the quality of the red reflex. The practitioner should take the time to become familiar with this reflex. The red reflex test (Brückner test) is useful for identifying disorders such as media opacities (eg, cataracts), large refractive errors, tumors such as retinoblastoma, and strabismus. A difference in quality of the red reflexes between the two eyes constitutes a positive Brückner test and requires referral to an ophthalmologist. The red reflex of each eye can be compared simultaneously when the observer is approximately 4 feet away from the patient. The largest diameter of light is shown through the ophthalmoscope, and no correction (zero setting) is dialed in the ophthalmoscope unless it is to compensate for the exam- iner’s uncorrected refractive error. A red reflex chart is avail- able through the American Academy of Pediatrics. "
422,Ocular Trauma,Critical Care ,1883,"OCULAR TRAUMA A foreign body of the globe or adnexa may be difficult to visualize due to its small size or location. The clinician should always maintain a high index of suspicion for an occult or intraocular foreign body if the history suggests this. In cases such as these, ophthalmologic referral needs to be considered. OCULAR FOREIGN BODIES  Clinical Findings Foreign bodies on the globe and palpebral conjunctiva usually cause discomfort and red eye. The history may suggest the origin of the foreign body, such as being around a metal grinder or being outside on a windy day when a sudden foreign body sensation was encountered associated with tear- ing, redness, and pain. Pain with blinking suggests that the foreign body may be trapped between the eyelid and the eye. Magnification with a slit lamp may be needed for inspec- tion. Foreign bodies that lodge on the upper palpebral conjunctiva are best viewed by everting the lid on itself and removing the foreign body with a cotton applicator. The conjunctival surface (palpebral conjunctiva) of the lower lid presents no problem with visualization. After simple removal of a foreign body that is thought not to be contam- ▲ Figure 15–6.

Other injuries to the globe and orbit are often present.  Treatment A shield should be placed over the eye, the head elevated, and arrangements made for ophthalmologic referral. NONACCIDENTAL TRAUMA  & SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME Shaken baby syndrome is a form of nonaccidental trauma characterized by a constellation of examination findings, including traumatic brain injury, retinal hemorrhages, and fractures of long bones or ribs. The history leading to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome is often vague and poorly correlated with the extent of injury.  Clinical Findings Victims often have multiple organ system involvement that includes, but is not limited to, traumatic brain injury, bone fractures and retinal hemorrhages. The presentation can vary from irritability to emesis, change in mental status, or cardiopulmonary arrest. Neuroimaging of the brain as well as a skeletal survey are tools used to diagnose shaken baby syndrome. Ophthalmic consultation and a dilated retinal examination are necessary to document retinal hemorrhages. Hemorrhages may be unilateral or bilateral and may be located in the posterior pole or periphery. Whereas retinal hemorrhages tend to resolve fairly quickly, those in the vitreous do not. If a blood clot lies over the macula, deprivation amblyopia may occur and may require intraocular surgery by a retinal specialist. Other ocular findings associated with nonaccidental trauma include lid ecchymosis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, hyphema, reti- nal folds, retinoschisis, and optic nerve edema. Acute-onset esotropia can also occur.  Differential Diagnosis The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome has obvious legal ramifications and is a subject of debate within the literature. The differential includes but is not limited to retinal hemor- rhages secondary to a fall, seizures, chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, blood dyscrasias, and Terson syndrome, among others. A team effort between the primary treating physician, neurosurgery, orthopedics, oph- thalmology, and social services is often needed to determine the true cause of a patient’s injuries.  Treatment Management of any systemic injuries is required. Observa- tion by an ophthalmologist of retinal hemorrhages for reso- lution is the usual course of treatment. Vitreous hemor- rhages or large preretinal hemorrhages that do not resolve within several weeks may need surgical treatment by a retinal specialist.

PREVENTION OF OCULAR INJURIES Air rifles, paintballs, and fireworks are responsible for many serious eye injuries in children. Golf injuries can be very severe. Bungee cords have been associated with multiple types of severe ocular trauma, including corneal abrasion, iris tears, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detach- ment, and blindness. Use of these items and associated activities should be avoided or very closely supervised. Safety goggles should be used in laboratories and industrial arts classes and when operating snow blowers, power lawn mow- ers, and power tools, or when using hammers and nails. Sports-related eye injuries can be prevented with protective eyewear. Sports goggles and visors of polycarbonate plastic will prevent injuries in games using fast projectiles such as tennis or racquet balls, or where opponents may swing elbows or poke at the eye. The one-eyed individual should be specifically advised to always wear polycarbonate eyeglasses and goggles for all sports. High-risk activities such as boxing and the martial arts should be avoided by one-eyed children.

429,Disorders of the Nasolacrimal System,Skin ,855,"DISORDERS OF THE NASOLACRIMAL SYSTEM NASOLACRIMAL DUCT OBSTRUCTION Nasolacrimal obstruction occurs in up to 6% of infants. Most cases clear spontaneously during the first year. Obstruction in any part of the drainage system may result from incomplete canalization of the duct or membranous obstructions. Nasolacrimal obstruction may also occur in individuals with craniofacial abnormalities or amniotic band syndrome.  Clinical Findings Nasolacrimal duct obstruction presents with tearing and mucoid discharge from the affected eye. Signs and symptoms include tearing (epiphora), mucoid discharge especially in the morning, erythema of one or both lids, and conjunctivi- tis (Figure 15–15). Light sensitivity and blepharospasm sug- gest possible congenital glaucoma and warrant an urgent ophthalmic referral.  Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of tearing includes nasolacrimal duct obstruction, congenital glaucoma, foreign bodies, nasal disorders, and in older children, allergies.  Treatment Massage over the nasolacrimal sac may empty debris from the nasolacrimal sac and may clear the obstruction, although the efficacy of massage in clearing nasolacrimal obstruction is debated. Cleansing the lids and medial can- thal area decreases the likelihood of infection and irrita- tion. Superinfection may occur, and treatment with topical antibiotics may help decrease the discharge. The mainstay of surgical treatment is probing, which is successful 80% or more of the time, but the success rate may decrease after the infant reaches 1 year of age. Other surgical procedures, including infraction of the inferior nasal turbinate, balloon dilation, and silicone tube intubation, may be necessary if probing fails. Much less often, dacryocystorhinostomy is required. Casady DR et al: Stepwise treatment paradigm for congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

J AAPOS 2005;9:192 [PMID: 15838451]. CONGENITAL DACRYOCYSTOCELE Congenital dacryocystocele is thought to result from obstructions proximal and distal to the nasolacrimal sac. An intranasal duct cyst may be present beneath the inferior turbinate at the valve of Hasner. These cysts may be associ- ated with respiratory distress. At birth, the nasolacrimal sac is distended and has a bluish hue that often leads to an erroneous diagnosis of hemangioma. The tense and swollen sac displaces the medial canthus superiorly (Figure 15–16). Massage and warm compresses are rarely effective. Repeated probing and endoscopic marsupialization of the intranasal cyst under general anesthesia may be required. Dacryocysti- tis and sepsis can result from dacryocystocele.

Mattering on upper and lower lids.    CHAPTER 15 408 DACRYOCYSTITIS Dacryocystitis is an infection of the nasolacrimal sac and results in erythema and edema over the nasolacrimal sac. Acute and chronic dacryocystitis are typically caused by bacteria that colonize the upper respiratory tract, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococ- cus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus species.  Clinical Findings Acute dacryocystitis presents with inflammation, swelling, tenderness, and pain over the lacrimal sac (located inferior to the medial canthal tendon). Fever may be present. The infection may point externally (Figure 15–17). A purulent discharge and tearing can be expected, because the cause of infection is almost always nasolacrimal obstruction. Signs of chronic dacryocystitis are mucopurulent debris on the lids and lashes, tearing, injection of the palpebral conjunctiva, and reflux of pus at the puncta when pressure is applied over the sac. Chronic dacryocystitis and recurrent episodes of low-grade dacryocystitis are caused by nasolacri- mal obstruction.  Treatment Treatment of severe acute dacryocystitis is with intravenous antibiotics after attempts at identifying the offending organism by culture and staining. Oral antibiotics can be tried in milder cases. Topical antibiotic administration is adjunctive and is also used with recurrent chronic infections. Warm compresses are beneficial. After the acute episode subsides—and in chronic cases—the nasolacrimal obstruction must be relieved surgi- cally. If it cannot be drained via the intranasal portion of the nasolacrimal duct, external drainage may be necessary. This should be done as a last resort since a fistula may develop. "
430,Diseases of the Conjunctiva,Skin ,1731,"DISEASES OF THE CONJUNCTIVA Conjunctivitis may be infectious, allergic, or associated with systemic disease. Trauma, irritation of the conjunctiva, and intraocular inflammation also can cause injection of conjuncti- val vessels that can be confused with conjunctivitis (Table 15–2). OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM Ophthalmia neonatorum (conjunctivitis in the newborn) occurs during the first month of life. It may be due to inflammation resulting from silver nitrate prophylaxis given at birth, bacterial infection (gonococcal, staphylococcal, pneumococcal, or chlamydial), or viral infection. In devel- oped countries, Chlamydia is the most common cause. Neonatal conjunctivitis may threaten vision if caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Herpes simplex is a rare but serious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis, since it may indicate sys- temic herpes simplex infection.  Clinical Findings Ophthalmia neonatorum is characterized by redness and swelling of the lids and conjunctiva and by discharge (Figure 15–18). Gram staining, Giemsa staining for elementary bod- ies, polymerase chain reaction amplification for Chlamydia and herpes simplex virus, and bacterial and viral cultures aid in making an etiologic diagnosis.  Prevention & Treatment Although no single prophylactic medication can eliminate all cases of neonatal conjunctivitis, povidone-iodine may provide broader coverage against the organisms causing this disease than silver nitrate or erythromycin ointment. Silver nitrate is not effective against Chlamydia. The choice of prophylactic agent is often dictated by local epidemiology and cost considerations. Treatment of these infections requires specific systemic antibiotics because they can cause serious infections in other organs. Specifically, Chlamydia can cause a delayed-onset pneumonitis. Parents should be examined and receive treat- ment when a sexually associated pathogen is present. Darville T: Chlamydia trachomatis infections in neonates and young children.

433,Disorders of the Iris,Skin ,10,"DISORDERS OF THE IRIS IRIS COLOBOMA Iris coloboma is a developmental defect due to incomplete closure of the anterior embryonal fissure. The child’s pupil has an elongated shape reminiscent of a keyhole or cat’s eye (Figure 15–20). The effect on visual acuity is variable. Iris coloboma may occur as an isolated defect or in association with various chromosomal abnormalities and syndromes. Variable genetic expression of colobomas can include a broad spectrum, from iris coloboma, to microphthalmia- with-cyst, and clinical anophthalmia.  Clinical Findings Penlight examination of the pupils reveals a keyhole shape to the pupil rather than the normal round configuration. A dilated examination by an ophthalmologist is necessary to determine if the coloboma involves additional structures of the eye including the retina. If the retina is involved, vision may be poor. A genetic evaluation is usually recommended due to the high rate of associated genetic syndromes.  Treatment Patients with coloboma should be monitored by an ophthal- mologist for signs of amblyopia, significant refractive errors, and strabismus. Rarely, if the retina is involved, detachment may occur requiring surgical intervention by a retinal specialist. ANIRIDIA Aniridia is a bilateral disorder that results in the absence of almost all of the iris (Figure 15–21). Cataract, corneal changes, macular hypoplasia, and glaucoma are often seen.

Iris coloboma located inferiorly.     CHAPTER 15 412 may occur as an autosomal dominant disease or in a sporadic form associated with Wilms tumor. The aniridia gene is located within the 11p13 chromosome region. Aniridia, geni- tourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation have been linked to an 11p deletion.  Clinical Findings Photophobia, nystagmus, and poor vision are present in aniridia. Abdominal ultrasonography is indicated in the sporadic form of aniridia to diagnose Wilms tumor. Genetic evaluation is indicated, as well.  Treatment An ophthalmologist should determine if cataracts or glau- coma are present in patients with aniridia. Surgical treat- ment is often indicated. If Wilms tumor is present, treatment by an oncologist is necessary. ALBINISM Albinism is caused by defective melanogenesis, usually as an autosomal recessive disease, but an X-linked form does occur. Tyrosinase is an essential enzyme in the production of melanin. Many cases of complete albinism are caused by mutations of the tyrosinase gene. Albinism with some pig- ment production, especially in people of African descent, is more commonly caused by mutations of the p gene.  Clinical Findings Affected individuals are usually legally blind and have nystag- mus (see later section on Nystagmus). Iris, skin, and hair color vary with the type and severity of albinism as well as the individual’s race. Iris transillumination is abnormal transmis- sion of light through an iris with decreased pigment. This may be obvious or may require slit-lamp examination with retroil- lumination to detect focal areas of trans-illumination. Other ocular abnormalities include foveal hypoplasia, abnormal optic pathway projections, strabismus, and poor stereoacuity. Albinism may be associated with other systemic manifes- tations. Bleeding problems occur in individuals with Her- mansky-Pudlak syndrome (chromosome 10q23 or 5q13), in which oculocutaneous albinism is associated with a plate- let abnormality. Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (chromosome 1q42–44) is characterized by neutrophil defects, recurrent infections, and oculocutaneous albinism. Other conditions associated with albinism are Waardenburg, Prader-Willi, and Angelman syndromes.  Treatment Children with albinism should be evaluated by a pediatric ophthalmologist in order to optimize their visual function. Low-vision aids such as telescopes, stand magnifiers, and large-print books are often required. Vision teachers in schools as well as ophthalmic specialists trained in treating low-vision patients can help increase the patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living and function within society. Parents and patients must be advised to use sunscreen and wear protective clothing to help prevent skin cancer. OTHER IRIS CONDITIONS Heterochromia, or a difference in iris color, can occur in congenital Horner syndrome, after iritis, or with tumors and nevi of the iris and use of topical prostaglandins. Malignant melanoma of the iris may also cause iris heterochromia. Acquired iris nodules (Lisch nodules), which occur in type 1 neurofibromatosis, usually become apparent by age 8 years. When seen on slit-lamp examination, Lisch nodules are 1–2 mm in diameter and often beige in color, although their appearance can vary. Iris xanthogranuloma occurring with juvenile xanthogranuloma can cause hyphema and glau- coma. Patients with juvenile xanthogranuloma should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist for ocular involvement.

434,Glaucoma,Skin ,3554,"GLAUCOMA  General Considerations Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure and results in vision loss due to optic nerve injury, corneal scarring, and amblyopia. Pediatric glaucoma can be congen- ital or acquired, pupillary block or angle closure, and unilat- eral or bilateral. Glaucoma can be classified on an anatomic basis into two types: open-angle and closed-angle. In chil- dren, precipitation of angle-closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil of an otherwise healthy eye is a very rare occurrence. Glaucoma also occurs with ocular and systemic syn- dromes. Aniridia and anterior segment dysgenesis are exam- ples. Systemic syndromes associated with glaucoma include Sturge-Weber syndrome, the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, and the Pierre Robin syndrome. Glaucoma can also ▲ Figure 15–21. Bilateral aniridia. Iris remnants present  temporally in each eye.     EYE 413 occur with hyphema, iritis, lens dislocation, intraocular tumor, and retinopathy of prematurity.  Clinical Findings Signs of glaucoma presenting within the first year of life include buphthalmos (enlargement of the globe due to low scleral rigidity in the infant eye) as well as tearing, photopho- bia, blepharospasm, corneal clouding due to edema, and optic nerve cupping. After age 3 years, usually only optic nerve changes occur. Findings may be unilateral or bilateral. In general, a red, inflamed eye is not typical of congenital or infantile glaucoma. Sudden eye pain, redness, corneal clouding, and vision loss suggests possible pupillary block or angle-closure glau- coma. Urgent referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated. Genetic evaluation should be completed if other systemic abnormalities are noted.  Treatment Treatment depends on the cause, but surgery is often indi- cated. Topical medications, which are available to help decrease the intraocular pressure, have limited success in pediatric glaucoma. Ishida K et al: Glaucoma drainage implants in pediatric patients.

435,Uveitis,Skin ,1405,"UVEITIS Inflammation of the uveal tract can be subdivided according to the uveal tissue primarily involved (iris, choroid, or retina) or by location (anterior, intermediate, or posterior uveitis). Perhaps the most commonly diagnosed form of uveitis in childhood is traumatic iridocyclitis or iritis. ANTERIOR UVEITIS Iridocyclitis associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis occurs most often in girls with pauciarticular arthritis and a positive antinuclear antibody test. Inflammatory bowel dis- ease is also associated with iritis—perhaps more commonly with Crohn disease than with ulcerative colitis. Other causes of anterior uveitis in children include syphilis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, relapsing fever (borreliosis), and Lyme disease, all but the last also causing posterior uveitis. Juvenile spondyloarthropathies, including ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome, and psoriatic arthritis, are also associated with anterior uveitis. A substantial percentage of cases are of unknown origin.  Clinical Findings Injection, photophobia, pain, and blurred vision usually accompany iritis (anterior uveitis or iridocyclitis). An excep- tion to this is iritis associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 27). The eye in such cases is quiet and asymptomatic, but slit-lamp examination reveals anterior chamber inflammation with inflammatory cells and protein flare. Children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis should be screened according to a schedule recommended by the Amer- ican Academy of Pediatrics (http://www.aap.org). Children with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis should have routine periodic ophthalmologic examinations to detect ocular inflammation, which may be asymptomatic, and cataracts associated with use of systemic corticosteroids. Other ocular findings of the anterior segment include conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and sterile corneal infiltrates. Pos- terior segment findings may include central serous retino- choroidopathy, panuveitis (inflammation of all uveal tissue), choroiditis, ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal vasculitis, neuroretinitis, and intermediate uveitis (see later section on Intermediate Uveitis). Posterior subcapsular cataracts can develop in patients with or without ocular inflammation. Most, if not all, of these patients have been taking corticosteroids as part of the long-term treatment of their autoimmune disease.  Treatment Treatment with a topical corticosteroid and a cycloplegic agent is aimed at quieting the inflammation and preventing or delaying the onset of cataract and glaucoma. Methotrex- ate and other immunosuppressive agents can be used in refractory cases. Levy-Clarke GA et al: Management of chronic pediatric uveitis. Curr Opin Ophthalmol 2005;16:281 [PMID: 16175040]. Reiff A: Ocular complications of childhood rheumatic diseases: Uveitis. Curr Rheumatol Rep 2006;8:459 [PMID: 17152145]. POSTERIOR UVEITIS The terms choroiditis, retinitis, and retinochoroiditis denote the tissue layers primarily involved in posterior uveitis. Infectious agents are the most common cause of posterior uveitis in the pediatric population.  Clinical Findings Children with posterior uveitis often present with systemic manifestations of a congenital infection. Examples include deafness, developmental delay, cataracts, “salt and pepper” retinopathy, and cardiac disorders seen in congenital rubella. Serologic analysis and retinal examination by an ophthal- mologist are used to identify the cause of posterior uveitis. Active toxoplasmosis (see Chapter 41) produces a white lesion appearing as a “headlight in the fog” owing to the    CHAPTER 15 414 overlying vitreitis. Inactive lesions have a hyperpigmented border. Contiguous white satellite lesions suggest reactiva- tion of disease. A granular “salt and pepper” retinopathy is characteristic of congenital rubella. In infants, the TORCH complex (toxo- plasmosis, other infections, rubella, cytomegalovirus [CMV], and herpes simplex virus) and syphilis must be suspected in congenital infections that cause chorioretinitis. Congenital lymphocytic choriomeningitis is diagnosed by immunofluorescent antibody or enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay serologic testing. Congenital lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus may also present with chorioretinitis. The virus is transmitted to humans by consumption of food contaminated with rodent urine or feces. It most closely resembles congenital toxoplasmosis in presentation. If possi- ble, pregnant women should avoid exposure to rodents. Ocular candidiasis occurs typically in an immunocompro- mised host or an infant in the intensive care nursery receiving hyperalimentation. Candidal chorioretinitis appears as multi- focal, whitish yellow, fluffy retinal lesions that may spread into the vitreous and produce a so-called cotton or fungus ball vitreitis. Acute retinal necrosis syndrome is caused most often by varicella-zoster virus and occasionally by herpes simplex virus. Patients may present with vision loss and a red and painful eye. Ophthalmoscopy may show unilateral or bilat- eral patchy white areas of retina, arterial sheathing, vitreous haze, atrophic retinal scars, retinal detachment, and optic nerve involvement. CMV infection must be considered as a cause of retinitis in immunocompromised and HIV-infected children. CMV retinitis appears as a white retinal lesion, typically but not always associated with hemorrhage, or as a granular, indo- lent-appearing lesion with hemorrhage and a white periph- ery. Cotton-wool spots (nerve fiber layer infarcts) also com- monly occur in HIV-positive patients. In toddlers and older youngsters, Toxocara canis or T cati infections (ocular larva migrans; see Chapter 41) occur from ingesting soil contaminated with parasite eggs. The disease is usually unilateral. Common signs and symptoms include a red injected eye, leukocoria, and decreased vision. Fundu- scopic examination may show endophthalmitis (vitreous abscess) or localized granuloma. Diagnosis is based on the appearance of the lesion and serologic testing using enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay for T canis and T cati.  Treatment Congenital toxoplasmosis infections must be treated with a triple drug regimen (see Chapter 41). Studies have shown improved ophthalmic and neurologic outcomes with pro- longed treatment. Other infectious agents such as Candida, varicella, and CMV may require systemic and intraocular injections of antimicrobial agents as well as retinal surgery. Treatment of toxocariasis includes periocular corticosteroid injections and vitrectomy. The prognosis for vision depends on the severity of retinal and systemic involvement. Chung H et al: Retinal complications in patients with solid organ or bone marrow transplantations. Transplantation 2007;83:694 [PMID: 17414700]. INTERMEDIATE UVEITIS Pars planitis, often of uncertain cause, can be associated with vitreous floaters. The inflammation is described as snow- banking because a heaped-up white precipitate is located in the far anterior periphery of the retina and vitreous base.  Clinical Findings Patients with pars planitis often complain of decreased vision and floaters. They may also have a history of a red eye and ocular discomfort. Patients with intermediate uveitis often have decreased vision. A prolonged duration of the disease can lead to deprivation amblyopia and strabismus. A dilated examination is required for observation of inflammation and snowbanking of the pars plana and vitre- itis. Slit-lamp and dilated funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist often reveal chronic signs of inflammation associated with intermediate uveitis, including macular edema, cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, irregular pupil, iris adhesion to the lens, and band keratopathy. Intermediate uveitis is often idiopathic although there are several other etiologies worth investigating. Toxocara infec- tions with peripheral granuloma can be associated with intermediate uveitis, as can inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and sarcoidosis. Retinoblastoma and other neoplasms can imitate uveitis, causing a so-called masquerade syndrome.  Treatment The most common treatment regimen for intermediate uveitis includes subtenon steroid injections, vitrectomy by a retinal surgeon, and systemic immunosuppression. Second- ary glaucoma often requires tube shunt surgery. The progno- sis depends on the severity of the disease and associated secondary complications such as glaucoma and cataracts. "
436,Ocular Manifestations of Acquired  Immunodeficiency Syndrome,Skin ,4885,"OCULAR MANIFESTATIONS OF ACQUIRED  IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME Ocular infections are important manifestations of AIDS (see Chapter 39). As CD4 T-lymphocyte counts fall below 200/μL, opportunistic infections increase in these patients. Pathogens commonly causing eye infection include CMV and varicella- zoster virus. Acute retinal necrosis syndrome (see earlier section on Posterior Uveitis) is a severe necrotizing retinitis that often results in blindness in patients with AIDS. Most    EYE 415 cases are thought to be caused by varicella-zoster virus. Other implicated agents are herpes simplex types 1 and 2. Patients with CD4 counts below 50/μL are at high risk for CMV retinitis and should have a complete ocular evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Various retinal abnormalities include cotton-wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, microaneu- rysms, perivasculitis, and decreased visual acuity from ischemic maculopathy.  Treatment Therapy with antiviral agents is required, but the prognosis is poor. Active CMV retinitis must be treated with intravenous antiviral therapy. Ganciclovir is the usual initial therapy; foscarnet may be required if resistance develops. Intravitreal ganciclovir or ganciclovir implants in conjunction with oral valganciclovir may be required in severe cases or in individu- als intolerant to intravenous therapy. The incidence of CMV retinitis has fallen dramatically with the use of multidrug antiretroviral therapy.

437,Disorders of the Cornea,Skin ,1356,"DISORDERS OF THE CORNEA CONDITIONS CAUSING CORNEAL CLOUDING Corneal clouding can be caused by developmental abnor- malities, metabolic disorders, trauma and infection.  Clinical Findings Corneal clouding, tearing, blepharospasm, and photophobia in a newborn are signs of congenital glaucoma until proven otherwise. Direct trauma to the cornea during a forceps delivery can result in corneal haze and significant amblyopia. Systemic abnormalities such as developmental delay and liver or kidney failure suggest metabolic disorders such as mucopolysaccharidoses, Wilson disease, and cystinosis. Cor- neal infiltrates occur with viral infections, staphylococcal lid disease, corneal dystrophies, and interstitial keratitis due to congenital syphilis. A complete ocular evaluation by an ophthalmologist is required and should be completed urgently when congenital glaucoma is suspected.  Treatment Treatment depends on the underlying condition. Surgical treatment of glaucoma and possible corneal transplantation may be required. MICROCORNEA & MEGALOCORNEA Microcornea—a corneal diameter less than 10 mm in a full- term infant or older child—may be associated with other anterior segment malformations or a microphthalmic globe. Megalocornea—diameter of 12.5 mm or greater—should be regarded as due to congenital glaucoma until proved otherwise. VIRAL KERATITIS Herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and adenovirus can all infect the cornea. When the epithelium breaks down, a dendritic or amoeboid pattern can be seen with fluorescein staining. Corneal involvement with herpes simplex can be recurrent and lead to blindness.  Clinical Findings Patients commonly present with a painful, red eye. Photo- phobia and decreased vision are also common complaints. Fever, malaise, and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection may be present. Fluorescein administration to the involved cornea will reveal areas of staining when viewed with a blue light. Decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and conjunctivitis may also be noted. Slit-lamp examination may reveal white infiltrates beneath the corneal epithelium.  Treatment Topical antivirals such as trifluridine and vidarabine are indicated when herpes simplex infection is limited to the corneal epithelium, although additional systemic therapy is required in newborns. Topical corticosteroids may be a useful addition to antiviral therapy when stromal disease is present. The use of corticosteroids in the presence of her- petic disease should be undertaken only by an ophthalmolo- gist because of the danger of worsening the disease. Oral acyclovir started in the early phase (first 5 days) may be helpful in treating herpes zoster eye disease. Acyclovir pro- phylaxis is helpful in preventing recurrent herpetic epithelial keratitis (see earlier section on Viral Conjunctivitis) and stromal keratitis caused by herpes simplex. Adenovirus conjunctivitis may progress to keratitis 1–2 weeks after onset. Vision may be decreased. In most cases no treatment is necessary because adenovirus keratitis is most often self-limiting. However, adenovirus is highly contagious and easily spread (see section on Viral Conjunctivitis). CORNEAL ULCERS Bacterial corneal ulcers in healthy children who are not contact lens wearers are usually secondary to corneal trauma from corneal abrasion or a penetrating foreign body. Decreased vision, pain, injection, a white corneal infiltrate or ulcer (Figure 15–22), and hypopyon (pus in the anterior    CHAPTER 15 416 chamber) may all be present. Prompt referral to an ophthal- mologist is necessary for culture and antibiotic treatment. "
438,Disorders of the Lens,Skin ,137,"DISORDERS OF THE LENS Lens disorders involve abnormality of clarity or position. Lens opacification (cataract) can affect vision depending on its density, size, and position. Visual potential is also influenced by age at onset and the success of amblyopia treatment. CATARACTS Cataracts in children may be unilateral or bilateral, may exist as isolated defects, or may be accompanied by other ocular disorders or systemic disease (Figure 15–23).  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Leukocoria, poor fixation, and strabismus or nystagmus (or both) may be the presenting complaints. Absence of a red reflex in the newborn should suggest the possibility of cataract, especially if the pupil has been dilated for the examination. This requires an urgent referral to an ophthalmologist. B. Laboratory Findings Laboratory investigation for infectious and metabolic causes of congenital cataracts is often indicated. Such investigation would include cultures or serologic tests for toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, herpes simplex virus, and syphilis, as well as evaluation for metabolic errors, such as occur with galac- tosemia or Lowe syndrome.  Treatment Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent depri- vation amblyopia in children younger than age 9 years, because they are visually immature. Cataracts that are visu- ally significant require removal. Visually significant cataracts in infants are usually removed prior to 6 weeks of age to prevent deprivation amblyopia. Rehabilitation with an intraocular lens is commonplace, especially with cataracts removed after the age of 2 years. But contact lenses and glasses still play a role, as does occlusion of the better-seeing eye to treat the amblyopia. Forbes BJ, Guo S: Update on the surgical management of pediatric cataracts. J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus 2006;43:143 [PMID: 16761634]. Vasavada AR, Nihalani BR: Pediatric cataract surgery. Curr Opin Ophthalmol 2006;17:54 [PMID: 16436925]. DISLOCATED LENSES Nontraumatic lens dislocation is usually bilateral. Sublux- ation causes refractive errors of large magnitude that are difficult to correct. Another ophthalmologic concern is pupillary block glaucoma, in which a malpositioned unstable lens interferes with the normal flow of aqueous humor from the ciliary body (posterior to the pupil), where it is pro- duced, into the trabecular meshwork (anterior to the pupil- lary plane).  Clinical Findings Slit-lamp examination reveals malposition of the intraocular lens. Refraction often reveals significant astigmatism. Sys- temic diseases including Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, sulfite oxidase deficiency, hyperlysinemia, syphilis, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are often associated with dislocated lenses. A complete ophthal- mic evaluation, as well as genetic and metabolic evaluation, may be necessary.  Treatment Surgical lensectomy may be required if the visual acuity is not improved significantly with glasses or contact lenses. ▲ Figure 15–22.

439,Disorders of the Retina,Skin ,94,"DISORDERS OF THE RETINA RETINAL HEMORRHAGES IN THE NEWBORN Retinal hemorrhages are commonly seen in the otherwise healthy newborn. Retinal hemorrhages occur most often after vaginal delivery but can also be present after suction delivery or cesarean section.  Clinical Findings A dilated retinal examination reveals unilateral or bilat- eral hemorrhages that can be located anywhere in the retina. They may appear as dot, blot, subretinal, or preretinal hemorrhages. They may also break into the vitreous.  Treatment In general, retinal hemorrhages of the newborn disappear quickly, usually within the first month of life, which may help differentiate this condition from retinal hemorrhages that occur in the shaken baby syndrome. Retinal hemor- rhages also occur in association with coagulopathy. RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to be an important cause of blindness, especially for infants born before 28 weeks’ gestation and weighing less than 1250 g. Premature infants with incomplete retinal vascularization are at risk for developing abnormal peripheral retinal vascu- larization, which may lead to retinal detachment. However, most cases of ROP do not progress to retinal detachment and require no treatment.  Pathogenesis The risk of developing visually threatening ROP is inversely proportional to birth weight and gestational age. Infants weighing less than 1500 g at birth or born at less than 33 weeks’ gestation may develop visually threatening ROP. The cause of this disorder—including the role of supplemental oxygen in the neonatal period—is still not fully understood. Other risk factors for severe ROP are bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis, apnea and bradycardia, and mutations of the Norrie disease gene. White males, infants with zone 1 disease, and infants with very low birth weight and gestational age have a higher risk of reaching threshold. Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor may play a key role in ROP development, and meth- ods of modulating it are being investigated.  Clinical Findings The Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO- ROP) study outlined a standard nomenclature to describe the progression and severity of ROP (Table 15–4). Since retinal blood vessels emanate from the optic nerve and do not fully cover the developing retina until term, the optic nerve is used as the central landmark. The most immature zone of retina, zone 1, is the most posterior concentric imaginary circle around the optic nerve. Further out is zone 2, and beyond that is zone 3. Zone 1 disease is by definition more high-risk than disease in more anterior zones. Simi- larly, the stages of the abnormal vessels are numbered from zero, or simply incomplete vascularization, through stages I– V. When five contiguous or eight noncontiguous clock hours of stage III disease occur, “threshold” has been reached. At this stage in the CRYO-ROP study, 50% of eyes had a bad outcome without treatment, progressing to stage IV or V. This was therefore chosen as the stage for mandatory treat- ment. “Plus disease” (+) refers to dilation and tortuosity of the vessels around the optic nerve and is an ominous sign of active, worsening ROP. “Rush disease” refers to cases in which the disease skips intervening stages and goes rapidly to retinal detachment. Screening guidelines recommend the first retinal exami- nation by an ophthalmologist be done at age 4–6 weeks after birth, or 31 weeks’ postconception, whichever is earlier. The frequency of follow-up examinations depends on the find- ings and the risk factors for developing the disease. Most infants are evaluated every 1–2 weeks. ROP often resolves when the infant reaches 40 weeks’ estimated gestational age. Examinations can be discontinued when the retinas are fully vascularized, or when the infant is 45 weeks’ gestational age and has never had prethreshold disease or worse, or is vascularized out to zone 3 and never had zone 1 or 2 disease.  Treatment The treatment of threshold ROP within 72 hours of diagno- sis can reduce the occurrence of bad visual outcomes by 50%. Diode laser treatment has largely replaced cryotherapy because it provides better access for treating zone 1 disease and causes less inflammation. However, some patients still  Table 15–4. Stages of retinopathy of prematurity. Stage I Demarcation line or border dividing the vascular from the  avascular retina. Stage II Ridge. Line of stage I acquires volume and rises above the  surface retina to become a ridge. Stage III Ridge with extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation. Stage IV Subtotal retinal detachment. Stage V Total retinal detachment.   EYE 419  Treatment Treatment of retinal detachment is surgical. For children with conditions predisposing to retinal detachment, or a strong family history, examinations under anesthesia by an ophthalmologist, with prophylactic laser treatment, are often recommended. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY Diabetic retinopathy is a specific vascular complication of diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 1, or insulin-dependent, diabetes are at higher risk of developing severe proliferative retinopathy leading to visual loss than are those with type 2, or non–insulin-dependent, diabetes.  Clinical Findings Acute onset of diabetes may be accompanied by sudden myopia and by cataracts. Sudden decreased vision in a diabetic patient may suggest the presence of severe ocular complications such as vitreous hemorrhage, macular edema, or retinal detachment. In children older than age 9 years, referral to an ophthal- mologist for screening of retinopathy should occur within 3–5 years after the onset of diabetes. Both conditions may be reversible with good glucose control. Young children with type 1 diabetes should be followed for the Wolfram, or DIDMOD, syndrome, in which diabetes mellitus occurs in conjunction with diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy, and deafness.  Treatment Severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy requires panretinal laser photocoagulation or vitreoretinal surgery (or both). Cataracts often require surgical removal and intraocular lens placement. Intraocular steroid injections have been used to treat macular edema in adults, but their role in children is not well established.

441,Diseases of the Optic Nerve,Skin ,1752,"DISEASES OF THE OPTIC NERVE OPTIC NEUROPATHY Optic nerve function is evaluated by checking visual acuity, color vision, pupillary response, and visual fields.  Clinical Findings Poor optic nerve function results in decreased central or peripheral vision, decreased color vision, strabismus, and nystagmus. Optic nerve disorders can be due to congenital malformation, malignancy, inflammation, infection, meta- bolic disorders, and trauma. The swinging flashlight test is used to assess function of each optic nerve. It is performed by shining a light alternately in front of each pupil to check for an afferent pupillary defect or Marcus Gunn pupillary defect. An abnormal response in the affected eye is pupillary dilation when the light is directed into that eye after having been shown in the other eye with its healthy optic nerve. This results from poorer conduction along the optic nerve of the affected eye, which in turn results in less pupillary constriction of both eyes than occurs when the light is shined into the noninvolved eye. Hippus— rhythmic dilating and constricting movements of the pupil—can be confused with an afferent pupillary defect. The optic nerve is evaluated as to size, shape, color, and vascularity. Occasionally, myelinization past the entrance of the optic nerve head occurs. It appears white, with a feathered edge (Figure 15–24). Myelinization onto the ret- ina can be associated with myopia and amblyopia. Ana- tomic defects of the optic nerve include colobomatous defects and pits.  Treatment Management of the underlying condition resulting in the optic neuropathy is necessary. OPTIC NERVE HYPOPLASIA Optic nerve hypoplasia may be associated with absence of the septum pellucidum and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunc- tion, which is known as septo-optic dysplasia, or de Morsier syndrome. Children with septo-optic dysplasia and hypocor- tisolism are at risk for sudden death during febrile illness  ▲ Figure 15–24. Myelinization extending from optic  nerve superiorly onto the retina.    EYE 421 OPTIC ATROPHY Optic atrophy is pallor of the optic nerve noted on ophthal- moscopy. Optic atrophy is found in children most frequently after neurologic compromise during the perinatal period. An example would be a premature infant who develops an intraventricular hemorrhage. Hydrocephalus, glioma of the optic nerve, craniosynostosis, certain neurologic diseases, and toxins such as methyl alcohol can cause optic atrophy, as can certain inborn errors of metabolism, long-standing papilledema, or papillitis.  Clinical Findings Direct examination of the optic nerve by ophthalmoscopy reveals an optic nerve head with a cream or white color and possibly cupping. Neuroimaging may be necessary to delin- eate CNS abnormalities.  Treatment Treatment of the underlying condition is indicated. "
443,Diseases of the Orbit,Skin ,802,"DISEASES OF THE ORBIT PERIORBITAL & ORBITAL CELLULITIS The fascia of the eyelids joins with the fibrous orbital septum to isolate the orbit from the lids. This septum serves as a barrier to the posterior spread of infection from preseptal infection. Infections arising anterior to the orbital septum are termed preseptal. Orbital cellulitis denotes infection posterior to the orbital septum and may cause serious complications, such as an acute ischemic optic neuropathy or cerebral abscess.  Pathogenesis Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis, which indicates infection of the structures of the eyelid, is characterized by lid edema, erythema, swelling, pain, and mild fever. It usually arises from a local exogenous source such as an abrasion of the eyelid, from other infections (hordeolum, dacryocystitis, or chalazion), or from infected varicella or insect bite lesions. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the most common patho- gens cultured from these sources. Preseptal infections in chil- dren younger than age 3 years also occur from bacteremia, although this is much less common since Haemophilus influen- zae immunization became available. Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia is still an occasional cause of this infection. Chil- dren with periorbital cellulitis from presumed bacteremia must be examined for additional foci of infection. Orbital cellulitis almost always arises from contiguous sinus infection, because the walls of three sinuses make up portions of the orbital walls and infection can breach these walls or extend by way of a richly anastomosing venous system. The orbital contents can develop a phlegmon (orbital cellulitis), or frank pus can develop in the orbit (orbital abscess).  Clinical Findings Children with preseptal cellulitis often present with ery- thematous and edematous eyelids. The vision, eye move- ments and eye itself are normal. Decreased vision, restricted eye movements, and an afferent papillary defect suggest orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis presents with signs of periorbital disease as well as proptosis (a protruding eye), restricted eye move- ment, and pain with eye movement. Fever is usually high. CT scanning or MRI is required to establish the extent of the infection within the orbit and sinuses. The pathogenic agents are those of acute or chronic sinusitis—respiratory flora and anaerobes. S aureus is also frequently implicated.  Treatment Therapy for preseptal and orbital cellulitis infection is with systemic antibiotics. Treatment of orbital infections may require surgical drainage for subperiosteal abscess in con- junction with intravenous antibiotics. Drainage of infected sinuses is often part of the therapy.

CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES Craniofacial anomalies can affect the orbit and visual system. Craniofacial anomalies occur with craniosynostoses and midface syndromes such as Treacher Collins and Pierre Robin syndromes. Fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with similar changes of the ocular adnexa.  Clinical Finding Ocular abnormalities associated with craniofacial disease involving the orbits include visual impairment, proptosis, cor- neal exposure, hypertelorism (widely spaced orbits), strabis- mus, amblyopia, lid coloboma, papilledema, and optic atrophy.  Treatment Orbital and ocular abnormalities associated with craniofacial anomalies often require a multispecialty approach. Manage- ment may require orbital and strabismus surgery. Ophthalmol- ogists also treat amblyopia and corneal exposure if present.

The most common benign tumor is capillary hemangioma (Figure 15–25). The most common primary malignant tumor of the orbit is rhabdomyosarcoma.  Clinical Findings Capillary hemangiomas may be located superficially in the lid or deep in the orbit and can cause ptosis, refractive errors, and amblyopia. Deeper lesions may cause proptosis. Capil- lary hemangiomas in infants initially increase in size before involuting at about age 2–4 years. Orbital dermoid cysts vary in size and are usually found temporally at the brow and orbital rim or supranasally. These lesions are firm, well encapsulated, and mobile. Rup- ture of the cyst causes a severe inflammatory reaction. Lymphangioma occurring in the orbit is typically poorly encapsulated, increases in size with upper respiratory infec- tion, and is susceptible to hemorrhage. Other benign tumors of the orbit are orbital pseudotumor, neurofibroma, ter- atoma, and tumors arising from bone, connective tissue, and neural tissue. Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (see Chapter 29) grows rap- idly and displaces the globe. The average age at onset is 6–7 years. The tumor is often initially mistaken for orbital swelling due to insignificant trauma. Tumors metastatic to the orbit also occur; neuroblastoma is the most common. The patient may exhibit proptosis, orbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes), Horner syndrome, or opsoclonus (dancing eyes). Ewing sarcoma, leukemia, Bur- kitt lymphoma, and the histiocytosis X group of diseases may involve the orbit. Examination of vision, eye movements, eyelids, and orbits often reveals amblyopia, eyelid malposition, strabis- mus, and proptosis. Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is required to delineate the location and size of orbital tumors.  Treatment Therapy for capillary hemangiomas includes observation and intralesional or systemic corticosteroids. Treatment is indicated if the lesion is large enough to cause amblyopia. Induced astigmatism or amblyopia (or both) are treated with glasses and patching respectively. Treatment of orbital der- moids is by excision. Rhabdomyosarcoma is treated with radiation and che- motherapy after biopsy confirms the diagnosis. With expedi- tious diagnosis and proper treatment, the survival rate of patients with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma confined to the orbit approaches 90%. Treatment of metastatic disease requires management by an oncologist and may require chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Ahuja R, Azar NF: Orbital dermoids in children.

444,Nystagmus,Skin ,3081,"NYSTAGMUS Nystagmus is a rhythmic oscillation or jiggling of the eyes. It may be unilateral or bilateral, more pronounced in one eye, or gaze-dependent. Nystagmus may be associated with esotropia or may occur with ocular lesions that cause deprivation amblyopia (eg, cataract and eyelid ptosis) or conditions in which the visual pathways are hypoplastic, sometimes referred to as “sensory nystagmus.” Nystagmus is seen with optic nerve hypoplasia, macular hypoplasia, aniridia, and albinism. Nys- tagmus can also occur with normal ocular structures and seemingly normal CNS development, sometimes referred to as “motor nystagmus.” In the latter instance, the nystagmus may be blocked in certain positions of gaze, in which case a face turn or torticollis may develop. Latent nystagmus occurs when one eye is occluded. This type of nystagmus occurs in patients with congenital esotropia. An associated amblyopia may be present. Most nystagmus occurring in childhood is of ocular origin, but CNS disease and, less frequently, inner ear disease are other causes. A CNS cause is likely when the nystagmus is acquired. Patients should be referred to an ophthalmolo- gist when nystagmus is observed.  Clinical Findings Evaluation of nystagmus begins with the pediatric ophthal- mologist. Careful evaluation for iris transillumination defects caused by albinism should be performed. An electroretinogram is usually required to rule out retinal pathology as the cause. Some types of nystagmus, usually motor nystagmus, can be treated, generally with surgery; less frequently, prisms are useful. Spasmus nutans, ▲ Figure 15–25. Right upper lid hemangioma causing  ptosis.    EYE 423 in which a rapid, shimmering, dysconjugate nystagmus occurs with head bobbing and torticollis, usually improves with time. Glioma of the hypothalamus can mimic spasmus nutans. Neuroimaging may be necessary to determine if the cause of the nystagmus is due to a CNS disease.  Treatment Therapy is directed at managing the underlying ocular or CNS disease. An ophthalmologist can optimize vision by correcting significant refractive errors and strabismus. The range of vision varies depending on the cause of the nystagmus. "
445,Amblyopia & Strabismus,Skin ,533,"AMBLYOPIA & STRABISMUS Visual development is a learned function. For it to proceed normally, a child must experience a normal visual environ- ment with well-aligned eyes that are free of vision-threaten- ing disease and significant refractive errors. The conse- quences of not meeting these requirements during the sensitive period of visual development in the first decade of life are strabismus and decreased vision, or amblyopia. AMBLYOPIA Amblyopia is a unilateral or bilateral reduction in central visual acuity due to the sensory deprivation of a well-formed retinal image that occurs with or without a visible organic lesion commensurate with the degree of visual loss. Amblyo- pia can occur only during the critical period of visual development in the first decade of life when the visual nervous system is plastic. Approximately 3% of the popula- tion is amblyopic. Amblyopia is classified according to its cause. Strabismic amblyopia can occur in the nondominant eye of a strabismic child. Refractive amblyopia can occur in both eyes if signifi- cant refractive errors are untreated (ametropic or refractive amblyopia). Another type of refractive amblyopia can occur in the eye with the worse refractive error when imbalance is present between the eyes (anisometropic amblyopia). Depri- vation amblyopia occurs when dense cataracts or complete ptosis prevents formation of a formed retinal image. Of the three types of amblyopia, the deprivation form of amblyopia results in the worst vision.  Clinical Findings Screening for amblyopia should be a component of periodic well-child examinations. The single best screening technique to discover amblyopia is obtaining visual acuity in each eye. In preverbal children unable to respond to visual acuity assessment, amblyogenic factors are sought, including stra- bismus, media opacities, unequal Brückner reflexes (pupil- lary red reflexes), and a family history suggestive of strabis- mus, amblyopia, or ocular disease occurring in childhood (see earlier section on Ophthalmic Examination).  Treatment The earlier treatment is begun, the better will be the chance of improving visual acuity. Treatment is usually discontin- ued after age 9 years. Amblyogenic factors such as refractive errors are addressed. Because of the extreme sensitivity of the visual nervous system in infants, congenital cataracts and media opacities must be diagnosed and treated within the first few weeks of life. Visual rehabilitation and amblyopia treatment must then be started to foster visual development. After eradicating amblyogenic factors, the mainstay of treatment is patching the sound eye, which causes the visual nervous system to process input from the amblyopic eye and in that way permits the development of useful vision. Other treatment modalities include “fogging” the sound eye with cycloplegic drops (atropine), lenses, and filters. Doshi NR, Rodriguez ML: Amblyopia. Am Fam Physician 2007;75:361 [PMID: 17304867]. Wu C, Hunter DG: Amblyopia: Diagnostic and therapeutic options. Am J Ophthalmol 2006;141:175 [PMID: 16386994]. STRABISMUS  General Considerations Strabismus is misalignment of the visual axes of the two eyes. Its prevalence in childhood is about 2–3%. Strabismus is categorized by the direction of the deviation and its fre- quency. Early diagnosis of strabismus and amblyopia, which often coexist, provides the best chance of reaching full visual potential. Strabismus may cause or be due to amblyopia. An infant whose eyes are destined to be well aligned may appear intermittently esotropic, but this should occur less frequently over the first few months of life. By age 5 or 6 months, the eyes should be constantly well aligned. Besides its effect on visual development, strabismus may be a marker of other ocular or systemic disease. Twenty percent of patients with retinoblastoma exhibit strabismus. Patients with CNS disorders such as hydrocephalus, space- occupying lesions, and an amaurotic (blind) eye can also exhibit strabismus. In children younger than age 3 or 4 years, blind eyes tend to assume a position of esodeviation, but after about age 4 years an amaurotic eye tends to show an exotropic shift. Misdiagnosis of strabismus when the eyes are well- aligned—pseudostrabismus—can occur when relying on the gross observation of the appearance of the two eyes. If the child has prominent epicanthal folds, pseudoesotropia may be diagnosed erroneously. Observation of the reflec- tion of a penlight on the cornea, the corneal light reflex, is a more accurate means of determining if the eyes are straight. If strabismus is present, the corneal light reflex will not be centered in both eyes. Observation of eye move-    EYE 425 The deviation most often begins intermittently and occurs after age 2 years. Congenital (infantile) exotropia is extremely rare in an otherwise healthy infant. Early-onset exotropia may occur in infants and children with severe neurologic problems. Evaluation of the corneal light reflex reveals nasal decen- tration of the penlight’s reflection in the deviated eye. All children with constant, congenital exotropia require CNS neuroimaging. Referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated.  Treatment Treatment of exotropia is with surgery, orthoptic exercises, patching, and occasionally glasses.

447,Unexplained Decreased Vision in Infants  & Children,Skin ,840,"UNEXPLAINED DECREASED VISION  IN INFANTS & CHILDREN Some infants with delayed visual development during the first few months of life who are otherwise normal neurolog- ically will reach an appropriate level of visual maturation. Occult causes of poor vision and blindness in children are those for which there are no obvious ocular defects: they include Leber congenital amaurosis, a childhood form of retinitis pigmentosa; achromatopsia, the absence of func- tioning cones in the retina; and optic nerve abnormalities, including optic nerve hypoplasia and atrophy. Cerebral visual impairment, also known as cortical blind- ness, is manifested as decreased visual attentiveness of vary- ing degree. Cerebral visual impairment can be congenital or acquired. Insults to the optic pathways and higher cortical visual centers are responsible. Asphyxia, trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia are some of the causes of cortical visual impairment. Besides an ophthalmologic workup, electroretinogram and visual evoked response testing may be required in children with decreased vision of unexplained etiology. Imaging studies of the brain and a pediatric neurologic evaluation may be useful.  Treatment A low-vision assessment may be indicated. Low-vision aids enhance remaining vision. Devices used include magnifiers for both distance and near vision, closed-circuit television, and large-print reading materials. THE BLIND CHILD A child’s development is affected profoundly by blindness or low vision. There are psychological consequences for the child blind from birth, as well as for the family. It can be devastating to a young family to find out that their newborn is blind. Although acquired blindness may give an individual time to grow as a sighted person and make preparations for life as a nonsighted person if loss of vision is slow and predicted, psychological consequences for the child and family must be addressed. The child who is blind from birth or from very early childhood has had little or no opportunity to form visual impressions of the physical world. Blind infants reach devel- opmental landmarks on a different schedule from that of sighted children. In addition, some blind children are multiply handicapped. For example, the premature child who is blind from retinopathy of prematurity may also have cerebral palsy. Children with Usher syndrome become both deaf and blind. Leading causes of blindness in the pediatric age group differ among regions of the world and between industrialized nations and developing countries. The most common causes of blindness in the pediatric age group are thought to be cerebral visual impairment, retinopathy of prematurity, and optic nerve hypoplasia. Albinism, optic atrophy, cataract, retinitis pigmentosa, microphthalmia or anophthalmia, aniridia, and glaucoma are other diseases causing blindness.  Clinical Findings Children with low vision will not fixate on visual targets and often have roving eye movements.

The alveolar ridges are continuous and relatively smooth. Within the alveolar bone are numerous tooth buds, which at birth are mostly primary teeth. Teeth Hard tissue formation of primary teeth begins at approxi- mately 4 months’ gestation. At birth, all 20 primary teeth are calcified. The central maxillary incisors are almost com- pletely calcified while only the cusp tips of the maxillary and mandibular second molars are calcified. There is a trace of enamel on the first four permanent molars at birth. The primary teeth usually begin to erupt at 6–7 months of age. On rare occasions (1:3000), natal teeth are present at birth or neonatal teeth erupt within the first month. These are most commonly (85%) mandibular primary incisors. They can be “real” primary teeth (90%) or supernumerary teeth (10%) and should be differentiated radiographically. Although the preferred approach is to leave the tooth in place, supernumerary and hypermobile immature primary teeth should be extracted. On occasion, such teeth must be smoothed or removed if their sharp incisal edge causes laceration of the tongue (Riga-Fede disease). If such teeth cause difficulties with breast feeding, pumping and bottling the milk is initially recommended while the infant is condi- tioned not to “bite” during suckling. Frena Noticeable but small maxillary and mandibular labial frena should be present (Figure 16–2). Several small accessory frena may also be present farther posteriorly. In rare cases, as in oro-facial-digital syndrome, there are multiple thick tightly bound frena. Decisions about surgical correction should be based on the ability to maintain the child’s gingival health and are best left until the late preteen years. Many thick frena do not require correction. The tongue is connected to the floor of the mouth by the lingual frenum (Figures 16–1 and 16–3). This connection should not impede the free movement of the tongue. If the ▲ Figure 16–1.

Children with cleft lip and palate should be referred as soon as possible to a multidisciplinary cleft palate team. Team members assess the patient’s medical status, feeding difficulties, general and dental development, hearing, facial esthetics, and overall well-being. Dental involvement in children with cleft palate is extensive and treatment may begin immediately after birth with fabrication of a palatal obturator as a feeding aid. This appliance, used by approxi- mately 32% of cleft teams in the United States and Canada, may also provide cross-arch stability after surgical closure of the lip and maxillary orthopedic molding before primary alveolar cleft bone grafting. Nasoalveolar molding can be used to guide the protruding premaxilla back into the oral cavity, thus making surgical lip closure easier when it is performed (usually by 10 weeks of age). However, opinions on its effectiveness, potential growth disturbances, and addi- tional costs differ among surgeons. Palate closure to facilitate the acquisition of normal speech without nasality follows at 12–18 months of age. The associated scar formation causes significant dentofacial growth disturbance. Orthodontic treatment addresses the sagittal and transverse maxillary growth deficits as well as irregularities in tooth eruption and position. Between 7 and 10 years of age, an alveolar bone graft is often necessary to promote proper "
452,Eruption of the Teeth,Eye ,1516,"eruption of the permanent teeth adjacent to the cleft. In some patients, a combined orthodontic-surgical repositioning of the perma- nent dentition is needed to complete a successful rehabilita- tion of the patient. Other Soft Tissue Variations Minor oral soft tissue variations can occur in newborns. Small (1–2 mm), round, smooth, white or grayish lesions are sometimes noted on the buccal and lingual aspects of the alveolar ridges or the midpalatine raphe. The latter, called Epstein pearls are considered remnants of epithelial tissue that were trapped along the raphe during fetal growth. The former, Bohn nodules, are remnants of mucous gland tissue. Both are benign, require no treatment, and usually disappear a few weeks after birth. Some newborns may have small intraoral lymphangio- mas on the alveolar ridge or the floor of the mouth. These and any other soft tissue variations that are more noticeable or larger than those just described should be evaluated by a dentist familiar with neonates. ERUPTION OF THE TEETH Normal Eruption Primary teeth generally begin to erupt at about 6 months of age. The mandibular incisors usually erupt before the max- illary incisors. The first teeth may appear as early as age 3–4 months or as late as age 12–16 months. Many symptoms are ascribed to teething, but any association with fever, upper respiratory infection, or systemic illness is probably coinci- dental rather than related to the eruption process. Attribut- ing fever to teething without thorough diagnostic evalua- tion for other sources has resulted in missing serious organic disease. Common treatment for teething pain is the application of topical anesthetics or teething gels, available over the counter. Most of these agents contain benzocaine or, less commonly, lidocaine. If improperly used, they can cause numbness of the entire oral cavity and pharynx. Suppression of the gag reflex can be a serious side effect. Systemic analgesics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen are safer and more effective. Chewing on a teething object can be benefi- cial, if only for distraction purposes. Occasionally, swelling of the alveolar mucosa overlying an erupting tooth is seen during teething. This condition appears as localized red to purple, round, raised, smooth lesions that may be symptomatic but usually are not. No treatment is necessary as these so-called eruption cysts or eruption hematomas resolve with tooth eruption. Delayed Eruption Premature loss of a primary tooth can either accelerate or delay eruption of the underlying secondary tooth. Early eruption occurs when the permanent tooth is beginning its active eruption and the overlying primary tooth is removed. This generally occurs when the primary tooth is lost within 1 year of its normal exfoliation. If loss of the primary tooth occurs more than 1 year before expected exfoliation, the permanent tooth will probably be delayed in eruption owing to healing that results in filling in of bone and gingiva over the permanent tooth. The loss of a primary tooth may cause adjacent teeth to tip into the space and lead to impaction of the underlying permanent tooth. A space maintainer should be placed by a dentist to avoid impaction. Other local factors delaying or preventing eruption include supernumerary teeth, cysts, tumors, overretained primary teeth, ankylosed primary teeth, and impaction. A generalized delay in eruption may be associated with global developmental delays, endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism or hypopituitarism), or other systemic conditions (cleidocra- nial dysplasia, rickets, or trisomy 21). Ectopic Eruption If the dental arch provides insufficient room, permanent teeth may erupt ectopically and cause a usually painless root resorption in the adjacent primary tooth. This phenomenon is more common in the maxilla, with ectopic eruption of the maxillary first permanent molar being the most frequent. In the mandible, lower incisors may erupt lingually and thus the primary predecessor may be retained. Parental concern about a “double row of teeth” may be the reason for the child’s first dental visit. If the primary teeth are not loose,   ORAL MEDICINE & DENTISTRY 431 they should be removed by the dentist to allow their succes- sors to drift into proper position. Impaction Impaction occurs when a permanent tooth is prevented from erupting. Although crowding is the most frequent reason, overretained primary or supernumerary teeth are other causes. The teeth most often affected in the developing dentition are the maxillary canines. Generally, they are brought into correct alignment through surgical exposure and orthodontic treatment. Variations in Tooth Number Failure of teeth to develop—a condition called hypodontia—is rare in the primary dentition. However, it occurs about 5% of the time in the permanent dentition. The most frequently miss- ing teeth are the third molars followed by the lateral maxillary incisors and mandibular second premolars. Oligodontia, a con- dition in which only a few teeth develop, occurs in patients with ectodermal dysplasias. Partial dentures should be considered as early as 3 years of age to improve the patient’s ability to chew. Occasionally, supernumerary teeth are present, most typi- cally in the maxillary incisor area, distal to the maxillary molars, or in the mandibular bicuspid region. Mesiodentes are peg-shaped supernumerary teeth situated at the maxillary mid- line that occur in about 5% of individuals. If they hinder eruption of adjacent permanent incisors, their timely removal is recommended. "
453,Dental Caries,Eye ,1421,"DENTAL CARIES  General Considerations Dental caries is biofilm-mediated acid demineralization of dental enamel or dentin. It is the most common chronic childhood disease and the most prevalent unmet health need of U.S. children. Caries is largely a disease of poverty; the 29 million children and adolescents in low-income families account for 80% of patients with tooth decay.  Pathogenesis Development of caries requires the interaction of four factors: (1) a host (tooth in the oral environment), (2) a suitable dietary substrate (fermentable carbohydrates), (3) cariogenic microorganisms that can adhere to the tooth, and (4) time, measured as the frequency of exposure to fermentable carbo- hydrates and the duration of the acid attack. Demineralization of the dental enamel occurs below a pH of 5.5, therefore flow and buffering capacity of saliva is an important modifier. The main bacteria implicated in the initiation of caries are Streptococcus mutans and S sobrinus; Lactobacillus acidophilus and L casei are linked to progression of caries. S mutans is most commonly transmitted from mother to child. A “window of infectivity” between 19 and 33 months of age has been described, but colonization can occur as early as 3 months of age. Earlier colonization increases the risk of caries. The greatest impact physicians can have on this disease is through early referral of high-risk children to dental practitioners. Dental plaque is an adherent film on the tooth surface that harbors bacteria in close proximity to the tooth enamel. As the bacteria metabolize sucrose, they produce lactic acid. The acidic environment causes the enamel of the teeth to decalcify. This is the first step in production of caries. After the carious process has penetrated the enamel, it advances through the dentin towards the pulp of the tooth. In response, blood vessels in the pulp dilate and inflammatory cells begin to infiltrate (pulpitis). If the carious lesion is left untreated, a frank pulp exposure will occur, triggering invasion of more inflammatory cells and the eventual formation of a small abscess in the pulp. If the abscess can drain into the oral cavity, the apical tooth tissue may remain vital. However, if the radical pulp becomes necrotic, a periapical abscess develops (Figure 16–6). Although this process is not always sympto- matic, it often leads to severe pain, fever, and swelling.  Clinical Findings & Treatment The diagnosis of caries is usually made by a visual-tactile oral examination using a dental explorer supplemented by radio- graphs. Radiographs are used to visualize caries on the surfaces between teeth that cannot be reached with the dental explorer. The earliest sign of caries is a white spot lesion—a white, chalky, decalcified area along the gingival margin or on approximated tooth surfaces. Frank carious lesions are light to dark brown spots or cavities of varying size on a tooth. A lighter shade of brown indicates more rampant decay, whereas arrested caries are almost black in ▲ Figure 16–6. Tooth  anatomy and progres- sion of caries.  Enamel Dentin Pulp Bone Gingiva Caries Advanced caries Periapical abscess   CHAPTER 16 432 color. In the early stages of decay, the tooth may be sensitive to temperature changes or sweets. At this point, the tooth can be repaired by removing the carious tooth structure and filling the defect with a restorative material. As decay progresses deeper into the pulp pain increases as more of the still-vital pulp becomes necrotic. Once the entire pulp is necrotic and nonvital, a choice must be made between root canal therapy (pulpectomy) or removal of the tooth. In the presence of cellulitis or facial space abscess, extraction with antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice. Because cavitation is a late stage of the disease, filling cavities does nothing to address the underlying pathologic process. Unlike other infections, dental caries cannot be treated by a simple course of antibiotics. The disease can only be cured through treatment of the pervasive oral infection, a sustained reduction in the number of cariogenic bacteria, and the creation of a favorable oral environment. To achieve this, a patient’s (and ideally a family’s) diet must be changed to avoid the frequent intake of fermentable carbohydrates in solid and liquid form. All active cavities must be restored to eliminate sources of reinfection and meticulous oral hygiene practices embraced to prevent plaque buildup and reduce the number of bacteria. Regular dental visits must be main- tained to monitor and reinforce good oral health practices. The concept of prevention through timely parent education, early diagnosis, and prompt intervention offers greater effi- ciency, better health outcomes, and lower costs than repeated restoration of diseased teeth.  Caries Prevention To prevent dental caries, it is necessary to remove plaque and its resident cariogenic bacteria on a regular basis. A. Oral Hygiene Oral hygiene should start at birth. The gums can be cleaned gently with a moist, soft cloth. Once the teeth begin to erupt, oral hygiene must be practiced in earnest. A small, soft toothbrush designed for infants should be used. Toothpaste is not necessary but should be added by age 2 years. Prior to age 8 years parents need to be involved daily in brushing and flossing. Brushing with fluoride-containing toothpaste at least twice daily and regular flossing will help to reduce the count of cariogenic bacteria in the oral flora. A second step is to decrease the amount of substrate available to the bacteria. Limiting the frequent ingestion of refined carbohy- drates is most effective because each exposure produces an acidic environment for up to 30 minutes. This explains the particularly deleterious effects of frequent consumption of sugar-containing juices, sodas, and infant formulas through a nursing bottle. The primary care physician plays an invalu- able role in disseminating this information and reinforcing these ideas. Children with special health care needs require dental advice and care more frequently. Children with serious medi- cal problems or disabilities should be referred to a pediatric dentist as early as possible, usually before 1 year of age. B. Fluoride Fluorides are safe and effective for caries control and preven- tion. Fluoride can be applied professionally or by the patient under supervision. Although more than half the U.S. popu- lation has access to fluoridated community water, an increasing number of families consume processed water with unknown fluoride content. The cariostatic mechanisms of fluoride include increased resistance to demineralization, enhanced remineralization, and inhibition of bacterial colo- nization of dental plaque. Fluoride affects the dentin and enamel of both erupted and unerupted teeth. Systemic effects are achieved by oral ingestion from sources such as fluoridated drinking water or fluoride supplements. Fluori- dated toothpaste and mouth rinses deliver topical benefits. Table 16–1 shows the current AAP and AAPD recommenda- tions for dietary fluoride supplementation in children drink- ing fluoride deficient water. The patient’s true exposure to fluoride must be judiciously evaluated before supplements are prescribed to avoid dental fluorosis. Because children younger than 6 years of age cannot expectorate reliably, the use of fluoridated toothpaste must be monitored by their parents and the recommendation to use only a “pea-sized” amount of toothpaste should be followed. Higher risk indi- viduals with orthodontic appliances, reduced salivary func- tion, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, or those who are unable to clean their teeth properly, are at dietary risk, have mothers or siblings with caries, or have active caries should be considered for additional topical fluoride therapy to supplement oral hygiene measures. "
454,Periodontal Disease,Eye ,4736,"PERIODONTAL DISEASE Periodontal disease involves a tooth’s supporting structures: bone, gingiva, and periodontal ligaments (Figure 16–7). It begins as inflammation of the gingival tissue adjacent to a tooth. Bacterial accumulation in the gingival sulcus causes irritation and inflammation. This beginning phase is called dental plaque–induced gingivitis, and it is found almost uni- versally in children and adolescents. Alterations in hormone Table 16–1.

Generally, this condition responds well to removal of bacterial deposits and improved oral hygiene. Periodontitis is characterized by loss of attachment and destruction of bone. Patients with localized aggressive peri- odontitis typically have severe alveolar bone loss around permanent first molars and incisors, whereas the generalized form involves other teeth as well. The prevalence is 0.2% in Caucasians, but much higher (2.5%) in African Americans. Familial aggregation and functional defects such as anoma- lies of neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterial activity increase the risk of periodontitis. Actinobacillus acti- nomycetemcomitans in combination with Bacteroides-like species are implicated in this disease. An association between maternal periodontal disease and preterm birth has been established. It is currently unclear whether this association involves causation or it is a marker for another etiology. Treatment consists of combined surgical and nonsurgical root debridement plus antibiotic therapy. Isolated chronic periodontitis is rare in children and adolescents but may complicate conditions such as Papillon-Lefèvre and Down syndromes, cyclic neutropenia, hypophosphatasia, agranulo- cytosis, and leukocyte adherence defects. The incidence of necrotizing periodontal disease is lower (1%) in North America than in developing countries (2–5%). Necrotizing periodontal disease is characterized by interprox- imal ulceration and necrosis of the dental papillae, rapid onset of dental pain, and often fever. Predisposing factors include viral infections (including HIV), malnutrition, emotional stress, and systemic disease. The condition usually responds rapidly to treatment consisting of mechanical debridement with ultrasonic scalers, improved oral hygiene, and metroni- dazole and penicillin for febrile patients. "
455,Orofacial Trauma,Eye ,1968,"OROFACIAL TRAUMA Orofacial trauma often consists only of abrasions or lacera- tions of the lips, gingiva, tongue, or oral mucosa (including the frena), without damage to the teeth. Lacerations should be cleansed, inspected for foreign bodies, and sutured if necessary. Occasionally, radiographs of the tongue, lips, or cheeks are needed to detect tooth fragments or other foreign bodies. All patients with facial trauma should to be evaluated for jaw fractures. Blows to the chin are among the most common childhood orofacial traumas. They are also a lead- ing cause of condylar fracture in the pediatric population. Condylar fracture should be suspected if pain or deviation occurs when the jaw is opened. Tooth-related trauma affects any or all of the dental hard tissues and the pulp, the alveolar process, and the periodontal tissues. The range of luxation injuries includes concussion; subluxation; intrusive, extrusive, and lateral luxation; and avul- sion. Figure 16–8 demonstrates the different luxation injuries, and Figure 16–9 shows the different degrees of tooth fracture. The least problematic luxation injuries are concussion (no mobility) and subluxation (mobility without displace- ment). Unless mobility is extensive, this condition can be followed without active intervention. Pulp vitality should be periodically assessed. Primary Teeth The peak age for injuries to primary teeth is toddlerhood. Any treatment must include measures to ensure the integrity ▲ Figure 16–7. Periodontal disease.

Parents should be advised of any permanent tooth complications such as enamel hypocalcifi- cations or crown-root dilacerations caused by intrusion injuries of primary maxillary front teeth. An intrusive lux- ation is usually observed for a period of time to discern whether the tooth or teeth will spontaneously re-erupt (see Figure 16–8). Severe luxations in any direction are treated with extraction. Avulsed primary teeth are not replanted. In a root fracture, the crown and apical fragment are generally extracted. The latter should be left for physiologic resorption if its retrieval would result in potential damage to the permanent tooth. Permanent Teeth Because the prognosis for viability worsens rapidly as time outside the mouth increases, avulsed permanent teeth should be replanted at or near the site of injury following gentle rinsing with clean water. The patient should seek emergency dental care immediately thereafter. Hank’s Bal- anced Salt Solution is the best storage and transport medium for avulsed teeth that are to be replanted. The next best storage media in decreasing order are milk, saline, saliva (buccal vestibule), or water. The commercially available Food and Drug Administration–approved Save-a-Tooth kit should be part of first-aid kits in schools and sports facilities (see references). Intrusions of permanent teeth are corrected with surgical or orthodontic repositioning. Lateral and extrusive luxations are generally repositioned and splinted for a minimum of 3– 4 weeks. Root canal treatment is necessary in the majority of injuries. Factors to consider during treatment planning are root development (open or closed apex) and the extent of the luxation. Pulp necrosis; surface, inflammatory, and replacement resorption; or ankylosis may occur at any time during the healing process and determine the long-term outcome. All luxated and replanted teeth need to be followed regularly by a dentist. "
456,Dental Emergencies,Eye ,1979,"DENTAL EMERGENCIES Dental emergencies other than trauma are usually associated with pain or swelling due to advanced caries. Odontogenic pain usually responds to acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Top- ical medications are of limited value. A localized small swelling confined to the gingival tissue associated with a tooth is usually not an urgent situation. This “gumboil” or parulis represents infection that has spread outward from the root of the tooth through the bone and periosteum. Usually it will drain and leave a fistulous tract. Facial cellulitis results if the infection invades the facial spaces. Elevated temperature (> 38.8°C), difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing are signs of more serious infection. Swell- ing of the midface—especially the bridge of the nose and the lower eyelid—should be urgently evaluated as a potential dental infection. Extraction of teeth or root canal therapy combined with antibiotics is the usual treatment. Hospitaliza- tion is a prudent choice for younger children with severe facial cellulitis especially if other risk factors are present—dehydra- tion, airway compromise, or possible noncompliance. Inpa- tient treatment consists of intravenous antibiotics such as clindamycin or ampicillin-sulbactam (Unasyn) with incision, drainage, and removal of the source of infection. ANTIBIOTICS IN PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY The antibiotics of choice for odontogenic infection are clindamycin and penicillin. Several patient groups require prophylactic antibiotic coverage prior to invasive dental manipulation. These include children with artificial heart valves, previous infectious endocarditis, certain congenital heart conditions, immunodeficiency, or central venous cath- eters. Revised guidelines for infective endocarditis prophy- laxis were published by the American Heart Association in April 2007. SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS Children with Cancer The most common source of systemic sepsis in the immuno- suppressed patient with cancer is the oral cavity. Therefore, children with cancer should be evaluated by a dentist knowl- edgeable about pediatric oncology soon after diagnosis. The aim is to educate the patient and caregivers about the importance of good oral hygiene and to eliminate all existing and potential sources of infection before the child becomes neutropenic as a consequence of chemotherapy. Younger patients have more oral problems than adults. Sources of infection include abscessed teeth, extensive caries, teeth that will soon exfoliate, ragged or broken teeth, uneven fillings, and orthodontic appliances. After an initial evaluation and before the initiation of cancer therapy, a dental treatment plan should be developed in discussion with the medical team. Preventive strategies include reduction of refined sug- ars, fluoride therapy, lip care, and patient education. Che- motherapeutic drugs and local irradiation are cytotoxic to the oral mucosa, which becomes atrophic and develops mucositis. Oral pain may be severe and often leads to inadequate food and fluid intake, infections in the oral cavity, and an increased risk of septicemia. Meticulous oral hygiene reduces the risk of severe mucositis. The pediatric oncology patient should be monitored throughout therapy to screen for infection, manage oral bleeding, and control oral pain. These patients can experi- ence spontaneous oral hemorrhage, especially when the platelet count is less than 20,000/mL. Poor oral hygiene or areas of irritation can increase the chances of bleeding.

Younger patients have more oral problems than adults. Sources of infection include abscessed teeth, extensive caries, teeth that will soon exfoliate, ragged or broken teeth, uneven fillings, and orthodontic appliances. After an initial evaluation and before the initiation of cancer therapy, a dental treatment plan should be developed in discussion with the medical team. Preventive strategies include reduction of refined sug- ars, fluoride therapy, lip care, and patient education. Che- motherapeutic drugs and local irradiation are cytotoxic to the oral mucosa, which becomes atrophic and develops mucositis. Oral pain may be severe and often leads to inadequate food and fluid intake, infections in the oral cavity, and an increased risk of septicemia. Meticulous oral hygiene reduces the risk of severe mucositis. The pediatric oncology patient should be monitored throughout therapy to screen for infection, manage oral bleeding, and control oral pain. These patients can experi- ence spontaneous oral hemorrhage, especially when the platelet count is less than 20,000/mL. Poor oral hygiene or areas of irritation can increase the chances of bleeding. Children receiving radiation therapy to the head and neck may develop salivary dysfunction (xerostomia) if sali- vary glands are in the path of the beam of radiation. Xero- stomia should be managed aggressively to avoid rapid and   ORAL MEDICINE & DENTISTRY 435 extensive destruction of the teeth. Customized fluoride applicators are used in this situation in combination with close follow-up. Children receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation may require long periods of immunosuppression. During the neutropenic phase of pretransplant conditioning, muco- sitis, xerostomia, oral pain, oral bleeding, and opportunistic infections may occur. Oral graft-versus-host disease as well as oral fungal and herpes simplex virus infections can be seen during the subsequent initial engraftment and hematopoi- etic reconstitution period. Long-term dental follow-up includes management of salivary dysfunction and craniofa- cial growth abnormalities from total body radiation and treatment of oral graft-versus-host disease. Pediatric oncology patients need regular care by a dentist familiar with young children and their growth and develop- ment. Oral and maxillofacial growth disturbances can occur after therapy. Late effects of therapy include such morpho- logic changes as microdontia, hypocalcification, short and blunted roots, delayed eruption, and alterations in facial bone growth. Children with Hematologic Disorders The child with hemophilia requires appropriate clotting factors before and after any invasive dental procedures, including local block anesthesia. Patients with factor VIII inhibitors who require oral surgical procedures should be admitted to a hospital. Some patients with very mild factor VIII deficiency or von Willebrand disease type 1 may respond to DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin). Antifibrinolytic medications such as ε-aminocaproic and tranexamic acid are used successfully after dental treatment. Topical medications such as Gelfoam and thrombin can be used to control postoperative bleeding. Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy should generally not undergo dosage adjustment before surgical dental treatment because the risk of embolic complications is much higher than bleeding complications in those whose anticoagulant therapy is con- tinued. However, the dentist is advised to consult with the hematologist to obtain the most recent INR (international normalized ratio) results and to discuss the most appropriate level of anticoagulation. Children with Diabetes Children who are insulin-dependent have significantly higher incidence of plaque, gingival inflammation, and attachment loss. They are, therefore, at high risk for periodontal disease. However, only those who are in poor metabolic control have an increased rate of caries. Care must be taken not to disturb the regular cycle of eating and insulin dosage. Anxiety associ- ated with dental appointments can cause a major upset in the diabetic child’s glycemic control. Postoperative pain or pain from dental abscess can prevent routine oral intake, necessitat- ing adjustment of insulin doses. "
457,Maternal-Fetal Relationship,Eye ,2878,"MATERNAL-FETAL RELATIONSHIP Childhood caries is an infectious disease transmitted by bacteria from the mother to the child. Infants whose mothers have high levels of S mutans are at greater risk for acquiring the organism. Dental treatment of their mothers or primary caregivers can delay or prevent the inoculation of the infant. A significant association between maternal periodontitis at 21–24 weeks’ gestation and preterm birth has been reported. However, according to a more recent study, periodontal treatment of expectant mothers does not improve the inci- dence of preterm delivery or significantly improve birth weight. The risk of preterm birth is elevated if a mother smokes and is of low socioeconomic status, both of which also increase the risk for periodontitis. Secondhand or pas- sive smoke increases the risk of caries in children. This association is independent of age, family income, geographic region, and frequency of dental visits. It is important to advise expectant mothers about these risk factors. There is a higher risk of oral developmental anomalies in preterm and low birth weight infants than in full-term infants. These developmental anomalies include enamel hypoplasia of the primary dentition, crown dilaceration of the permanent maxillary incisors, and a narrow palate caused by laryngoscopy or prolonged endotracheal intuba- tion. The role of palatal protection plates to prevent “groov- ing” remains unclear. It is difficult to distinguish delayed dental development of preterm infants from that associated with global developmental delays. DENTAL & ORTHODONTIC REFERRAL Orthodontic referral is usually made by the dentist. Early referral is indicated for any child with a craniofacial growth disorder. Other children may be referred at any time between ages 6 and 12 years, depending on their growth and oral development. Orthodontists differ about when to begin treatment. Many pediatric dentists provide early orthodontic management as a part of their practices. REFERENCES Print Resources Andreasen JO et al: Traumatic Dental Injuries, 2nd ed.

459,The Ear,Eye ,93,"THE EAR INFECTIONS OF THE EAR The spectrum of infectious ear diseases includes the struc- tures of the outer ear (otitis externa), the middle ear (acute otitis media), the mastoid bone (mastoiditis), and the inner ear (labyrinthitis). 1. Otitis Externa Otitis externa is inflammation of the skin lining the ear canal and surrounding soft tissue. The most common cause is loss of the protective function of cerumen, leading to maceration of the underlying skin such as occurs with swimming. Other causes are trauma to the ear canal from using cotton-tipped applicators for cleaning or from using poorly fitted ear plugs while swimming; contact dermatitis due to hair sprays, perfumes, or self-administered ear drops; secondary infec- tion of the canal from otitis media with a patent tympanos- tomy tube; and chronic drainage from a perforated tympanic membrane (TM). Infections due to Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common. Symptoms include pain and itching in the ear, especially with chewing or pressure on the tragus. Movement of the pinna or tragus causes considerable pain. Drainage may be minimal unless the otitis externa is from a draining pressure equalization tube or TM perforation. The ear canal is typi- cally grossly swollen, and the patient may resist any attempt to insert an ear speculum. Debris is noticeable in the canal. It is often impossible to visualize the TM. Hearing is normal unless complete occlusion has occurred.  Treatment Topical treatment usually suffices. Fluoroquinolone drops may be more effective than traditional combination drops and are safer to use. If the TM cannot be seen, then a perforation should be presumed to exist. Children with otitis externa secondary to draining tubes or perforations should be treated with topical therapy only in the absence of systemic symptoms. The topical therapy chosen must be safe for the inner ear because the perforation or the patent tube allows the drops access to the middle and inner ear. If the ear canal is open, ototopical antibiotics are placed and pre- scribed for 5–7 days as indicated. If the canal is too edema- tous to allow the ear drop to get in, a Pope ear wick (expandable sponge) is needed for the first few days to assure antibiotic delivery. Oral antibiotics are indicated if any signs of invasive infection, such as fever, cellulitis of the auricles, or tender postauricular lymph nodes, are present. In such cases, prescribe an antistaphylococcal antibiotic while await- ing the results of the cultured ear canal discharge. Systemic antibiotics alone without topical treatment will not success- fully treat otitis externa. Narcotic analgesics may be required until the infection begins to resolve in 2–3 days. During the acute phase, the patient should avoid swim- ming. A cotton ear plug is not helpful and may prolong the infection. Schedule a follow-up visit in 1 week to document an intact TM (Figure 17–1). Children who have intact TMs and are predisposed to external otitis should receive 2 or 3 drops of a 1:1 solution of white vinegar and 70% ethyl alcohol into the ears before and after swimming.

475,The Nose & Paranasal Sinuses,Eye ,165,"THE NOSE & PARANASAL SINUSES ACUTE VIRAL RHINITIS (COMMON  COLD; SEE ALSO CHAPTER 38) The common cold (viral upper respiratory infection) is the most common pediatric infectious disease, and the incidence is higher in early childhood than in any other period of life. Children younger than age 5 years typically have 6–12 colds per year. Approximately 30–40% of these are caused by rhinoviruses. Other culprits include adenoviruses, coronavi- ruses, enteroviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus.  Clinical Findings The patient usually experiences a sudden onset of clear or mucoid rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and sore throat. Cough or fever may develop. Although fever is usually not a prominent feature in older children and adults, in the first 5 or 6 years of life it can be as high as 40.6°C without superinfection. The nose, throat, and tympanic membranes may appear red and inflamed. Figure 17–6 shows the duration of cough, sore throat, and rhinorrhea in adults with rhinovirus-proven infections. The average dura- tion of symptoms is about 1 week. Nasal secretions tend to become thicker and more purulent after day 2 of infection due to shedding of epithelial cells and influx of neutrophils. This discoloration should not be assumed to be a sign of bacterial rhinosinusitis, unless it persists beyond 10–14 days, by which time the patient should be experiencing significant symptomatic improvement.  Treatment Treatment for the common cold should be symptomatic (Figure 17–7). Acetaminophen or ibuprofen is helpful for fever and pain. Nasal congestion can be treated with nasal saline drops and bulb suctioning for an infant or child unable to blow his or her nose. A topical decongestant such as oxymetazoline may provide some relief, but should be discontinued within 3 days to prevent severe rebound nasal congestion or chemical rhinitis. A cool mist vaporizer or humidifier may help the cough, but antimicrobial solution should be added to the water or the device should be cleaned at least every 3 days. Available scientific data suggest that cold and cough med- ications are generally not effective in children, and may be associated with serious adverse effects. Antihistamines have not proven effective in relieving cold symptoms. In rhinoviral colds, increased levels of histamine are not observed. There is insufficient evidence of benefit to warrant the use of antibi- otics for common cold symptoms. Oral decongestants have been found to provide some symptomatic relief in adults but have not been well-studied in children. Cough suppression at night is the number one goal of many parents; however, the effectiveness of dextromethorphan is unclear. It is believed by most experts to be effective in adults and adolescents, but benefit has not been proven in younger children. Use of narcotic antitussives is discouraged, as these have been asso- ciated with severe respiratory depression. Education and reassurance may be the most important “therapy” for the common cold. Parents should be informed about the expected nature and duration of symptoms, effi- cacy and potential side effects of medications, and the signs and symptoms of complications of the common cold, such as bacterial rhinosinusitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia.

Federico, MD RESPIRATORY TRACT Pediatric pulmonary diseases account for almost 50% of deaths in children younger than age 1 year and about 20% of all hospitalizations of children younger than age 15 years. Approximately 7% of children have a chronic disorder of the lower respiratory system. Understanding the pathophysiol- ogy of many pediatric pulmonary diseases requires an appre- ciation of the normal growth and development of the lung. GROWTH & DEVELOPMENT The lung has its origins from an outpouching of the foregut during the fourth week of gestation. The development of the lung is divided into five overlapping stages. 1. Embryonic stage (3–7 weeks’ gestation). During this stage, the primitive lung bud undergoes asymmetrical branching and then subsequent dichotomous branch- ing, leading to the development of the conducting air- ways. This stage of lung development is dependent on a complex interaction of various growth factors originat- ing in both the pulmonary epithelium and the splanch- nic mesenchyme. It also sees the development of the large pulmonary arteries from the sixth aortic arch and the pulmonary veins as outgrowths of the left atrium. Abnormalities during this stage result in congenital abnormalities such as lung aplasia, tracheoesophageal fistula, and congenital pulmonary cysts. 2. Pseudoglandular stage (5–17 weeks’ gestation). During this stage, which overlaps with the embryonic stage, the lung has a glandular appearance and witnesses the com- pletion of the conducting airways (bronchi and bronchi- oles). The respiratory epithelium of these airways begins to differentiate, and the presence of cartilage, smooth muscle cells, and mucus glands are first seen. In addi- tion, the pleuroperitoneal cavity divides into two distinct compartments. Abnormalities during this stage lead to pulmonary sequestration, cystic adenomatoid malfor- mation, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. 3. Canalicular stage (16–26 weeks’ gestation). This stage witnesses the delineation of the pulmonary acinus. The alveolar type II cells differentiate into type I cells, the pulmonary capillary network develops, and the alveolar type I cells closely approximate with the developing capillary network. Abnormalities of development during this stage include neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and lung hypoplasia. 4. Saccular stage (26–36 weeks’ gestation). During this stage further branching of the terminal saccules takes place as well as a thinning of the interstitium and fusion of the type I cell and capillary basement membrane in prepara- tion for the lungs’ function as a gas-exchange organ. 5. Alveolar stage (36 weeks’ gestation to 3–8 years of age). Controversy surrounds the length of this stage of lung development. This stage witnesses secondary septal for- mation, further sprouting of the capillary network, and the development of true alveoli. Abnormalities during this stage lead to lung hypoplasia and can result in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At birth, the lung assumes the gas-exchanging function served by the placenta in utero, placing immediate stress on all components of the respiratory system. Abnormalities in the lung, respiratory muscles, chest wall, airway, respiratory controller, or pulmonary circulation may therefore be present at birth. Survival after delivery depends, for example, on the development of the surfactant system to maintain airspace stability and allow gas exchange. Immaturity of the surfactant system, often seen in infants born before 35 weeks’ gestational age, can result in severe respiratory morbidity in the immediate neonatal period as well as subsequent chronic lung disease. A lethal form of lung disease has been recog- nized in infants homozygous for abnormalities in the gene for surfactant protein B.

There is mounting evidence that abnormalities during fetal and neonatal growth and development of the lung have long-standing effects into adulthood, such as reduced gas exchange, exer- cise intolerance, asthma, and an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

494,Diagnostic Aids,Eye ,1053,"DIAGNOSTIC AIDS PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT The four components of a complete pulmonary examination include: inspection, palpation, auscultation, and percussion. Inspection of respiratory rate, depth, ease, symmetry, and rhythm of respiration is critical to the detection of pulmonary disease. In young children, an elevated respiratory rate may be an initial indicator of pneumonia or hypoxemia. In a study of children with respiratory illnesses, abnormalities of atten- tiveness, consolability, respiratory effort, color, and move- ment had a good diagnostic accuracy in detecting hypoxemia. Palpation of tracheal position, symmetry of chest wall move- ment, and vibration with vocalization can help in identifying intrathoracic abnormalities. A shift in tracheal position can suggest pneumothorax or significant atelectasis. Tactile fremitus may change with the presence of consolidation or air in the pleural space. Other helpful noise transmission tests include whispered pectoriloquy, bronchophony, and egoph- ony. Although chest radiography has replaced the utility of these tests, they can be helpful when imaging is not available. Auscultation should assess the quality of breath sounds and detect the presence of abnormal sounds such as fine or coarse crackles, wheezing, or rhonchi. It is important to know the lung anatomy in order to identify the location of abnormal findings (Figure 18–1). In older patients, unilateral crackles are the most valuable examination finding in pneumonia. Percussion may identify tympanic or dull sounds that can help define an intrathoracic process. (This component of the examination can prove challenging in young children, who may not cooperate.) Extrapulmonary manifestations of pul- monary disease include growth failure, altered mental status (from hypoxemia or hypercapnia), cyanosis, clubbing, and osteoarthropathy. Evidence of cor pulmonale (loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound, hepatomegaly, ele- vated neck veins, and rarely, peripheral edema) signifies advanced lung disease. Respiratory disorders can be secondary to disease in other systems. It is therefore important to look for other condi- tions such as congenital heart disease (murmur or gallop), neuromuscular disease (muscle wasting or scoliosis), immu- nodeficiency (rash or diarrhea), and autoimmune disease or occult malignancy (arthritis or hepatosplenomegaly).

Wipf JE et al: Diagnosing pneumonia by physical examination: Relevant or relic? Arch Intern Med 1999;159:1082 [PMID: 10335685]. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS Lung function tests can help to differentiate obstructive from restrictive lung diseases, measure disease severity, define pre- cipitants of symptoms, and evaluate response to therapy. They can help define the risks of anesthesia and surgery and assist in the planning of respiratory care in the postoperative period. However, the range of normal values for a test may be wide, and the predicted normal values change dramatically with growth. For this reason, serial determinations of lung function are often more informative than a single determination. Patient cooperation is essential for almost all physiologic assessments. ▲ Figure 18–1.

LARYNGOSCOPY & BRONCHOSCOPY The indications for laryngoscopy include undiagnosed hoarseness, stridor, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, and laryngeal wheezing consistent with a diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction; indications for bronchoscopy include wheezing, suspected foreign body, pneumonia, atelectasis, chronic cough, hemoptysis, placement of an endotracheal tube, and assessment of its patency. In general, the more specific the indication, the higher the diagnostic yield. Pediatric bronchoscopy instruments are of either the flexible fiberoptic or the rigid open tube type. Flexible bronchoscopy has the following advantages: 1. With conscious sedation and topical anesthetics, the procedure can be done at the bedside. 2. Evaluation of the upper airway can be done with little risk in patients who are awake. 3. The distal airways of intubated patients can be examined without removing the endotracheal tube. 4. The instrument can be used as an obturator to intubate a patient with a difficult upper airway. 5. Endotracheal tube placement and patency can be checked. 6. Assessment of airway dynamics is generally better. 7. It is possible to examine more distal airways. Improvements in digital optics have greatly enhanced the image quality. The advantages of using a rigid instrument are (1) easier removal of foreign bodies (thus rigid bronchos- copy is preferred for suspected foreign body aspiration); and (2) better airway control, allowing the patient to be venti- lated through the bronchoscope. In addition, this approach to the airway allows better assessment of the subglottic space for stenosis. The choice of procedures depends largely on the expertise available. Bronchoalveolar lavage through a flexible broncho- scope is used to detect infection. Aspiration and hemor- rhage can be suspected in the presence of lipid- and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, respectively, though lipid-laden macrophages can also be found in other condi- tions. Analysis of lavage fluid can also be completed for cell counts, surfactant proteins, and inflammatory mediators. Transbronchial biopsy in children is limited to evaluation for infection and rejection in transplant patients due to poor diagnostic yield in most conditions. Transbronchial biopsy may have a role in diagnosing diffuse lung diseases such as sarcoidosis. Naguib ML et al: Use of laryngeal mask airway in flexible bron- choscopy in infants and children.

497,General Therapy of Pediatric Lung Diseases,Eye ,2728,"GENERAL THERAPY OF PEDIATRIC LUNG DISEASES OXYGEN THERAPY Oxygen therapy in children with respiratory disease can reduce the work of breathing, resulting in fewer respiratory symptoms; relax the pulmonary vasculature, lessening the potential for pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure; and improve feeding. Patients breathing spontane- ously can be treated by nasal cannula, head hood, or mask (including simple, rebreathing, nonrebreathing, or Venturi masks). The general goal of oxygen therapy is to achieve an arterial oxygen tension of 65–90 mm Hg or an oxygen saturation above 92%. The actual oxygen concentration achieved by nasal cannula or mask depends on the flow rate, the type of mask used, and the patient’s age. Small changes in flow rate during oxygen administration by nasal cannula can lead to substantial changes in inspired oxygen concentration in young infants. The amount of oxygen required to correct hypoxemia may vary according to the child’s activity. It is not unusual, for example, for an infant with chronic lung disease to require 0.75 L/min while awake but 1 L/min while asleep or feeding. Although the head hood is an efficient device for delivery of oxygen in young infants, the nasal cannula is used more often because it allows the infant greater mobility. The cannula has nasal prongs that are inserted in the nares. Flow through the nasal cannula should generally not exceed 3 L/ min to avoid excessive drying of the mucosa. Even at high flow rates, oxygen by nasal cannula rarely delivers inspired oxygen concentrations greater than 40–45%. In contrast, partial rebreathing and nonrebreathing masks or head hoods achieve inspired oxygen concentrations as high as 90–100%. Because the physical findings of hypoxemia are subtle, the adequacy of oxygenation should be measured as the arterial oxygen tension, or oxygen saturation can be deter- mined by oximetry. The advantages of the latter noninvasive method include the ability to obtain continuous measure- ments during various normal activities and to avoid artifacts caused by crying or breath-holding during attempts at arte- rial puncture. For children with chronic cardiopulmonary disorders that may require supplemental oxygen therapy (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or CF), frequent noninvasive assessments are essential to ensure the safety and adequacy of treatment.

INHALATION OF MEDICATIONS Airway obstruction that is at least partially reversed by an inhaled bronchodilator can be seen in CF, bronchiolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as in acute and chronic asthma. Inhaled medications can be used to deliver anti-   CHAPTER 18 476 inflammatory medications, mucolytics, or antibiotics in patients with a variety of lung diseases. The inhaled β-adrenergic agonists may be delivered by metered-dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, or nebulizer. Metered-dose inhalers are convenient and best combined with valved holding chambers, especially for children who lack the ability to coordinate actuation of the metered-dose inhaler with inhalation. In contrast, the nebulizer is an effec- tive method of delivering medication to infants and young children. Long-acting inhaled β2-adrenergic agents that are relatively selective for the respiratory tract are described in Chapter 36. Inhaled bronchodilators are as effective as injected agents for treating acute episodes of airway obstruc- tion and have fewer side effects. These drugs can be safely administered at home as long as both the physician and the family realize that a poor response may signify the need for corticosteroids to help restore β-adrenergic responsiveness. Anticholinergic agents may also acutely decrease airway obstruction. Furthermore, they may yield a longer duration of bronchodilation than do many adrenergic agents. Selected patients may benefit from receiving both β-adrenergic and anticholinergic agents. In general, this class of drugs is most effective in the treatment of chronic bronchitis. Chronic use of inhaled medications is common in chil- dren with chronic lung diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids are standard of care for persistent asthma and may be delivered by metered-dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, or nebulizer. Dornase alfa is used as a mucolytic in CF and other "

Inhaled antibiotics may be used acutely or chronically in patients with lung disease that predispose them to chronic airway infections. Rubin BK, Fink JB: The delivery of inhaled medication to the young child. Pediatr Clin North Am 2003;50:717 [PMID: 12877243]. AIRWAY CLEARANCE THERAPY Chest physical therapy, with postural drainage, percussion, and forced expiratory maneuvers, has been widely used to improve the clearance of lower airway secretions even though there are limited data on the efficacy of these techniques. Children with CF have been shown to benefit from routine airway clearance. Many airway clearance techniques exist, but only a few long-term studies have compared the various options. The various techniques currently available include chest physiotherapy, autogenic drainage, positive expiratory pressure (Flutter or Acapella), intrapulmonary percussive ven- tilation, or high-frequency chest compression. The decision about which technique to use should be based on the patient’s age and preference after trying different approaches. Often bronchodilators or mucolytic medications are given prior to or during airway clearance therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled antibiotics should be given after airway clearance therapy so that the airways are first cleared of secretions, allowing the medications to maximally penetrate into the lung.

AVOIDANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS All parents or other caregivers should be counseled about environmental hazards to the lung. The list of potential hazards includes small objects that may be aspirated, allergens that can precipitate respiratory symptoms in atopic children, and tobacco smoke. The harmful effects of smoking in the home deserve special emphasis. Children from families where the parents and others smoke have decreased lung growth as well as decreased pulmonary function in comparison with children raised in smoke-free homes. Exposure of children to tobacco smoke also leads to an increased frequency of lower respiratory tract infections and an increased incidence of respiratory symptoms, including recurrent wheezing. Health care providers must increase their efforts to educate patients and their families about the hazards of smoking.

DISORDERS OF THE CONDUCTING AIRWAYS The conducting airways (the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles) direct inspired air to the gas-exchange units of the lung; they do not participate in gas exchange themselves. Airflow obstruction in the conducting airways occurs by (1) external compression (eg, vascular ring or tumor), (2) abnormalities of the airway structure itself (eg, congenital defects or thickening of an airway wall due to inflammation), or (3) material in the airway lumen (eg, foreign body or mucus). Airway obstruction can be fixed (airflow limited in both the inspiratory and the expiratory phases) or variable (air- flow limited more in one phase of respiration than in the other). Variable obstruction is common in children because their airways are more compliant and susceptible to dynamic compression. With variable extrathoracic airway obstruction (eg, croup), airflow limitation is greater during inspiration, leading to inspiratory stridor. With variable intrathoracic obstruction (eg, bronchomalacia), limitation is greater dur- ing expiration, producing expiratory wheezing. Thus deter- mining the phase of respiration in which obstruction is greatest may be helpful in localizing the site of obstruction.   RESPIRATORY TRACT & MEDIASTINUM 477 EXTRATHORACIC AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION Patients with abnormalities of the extrathoracic airway may present with snoring and other symptoms of obstructive apnea, hoarseness, brassy cough, or stridor. The course of the illness may be acute (eg, infectious croup), recurrent (eg, spasmodic croup), chronic (eg, subglottic stenosis), or pro- gressive (eg, laryngeal papillomatosis). Significant risk fac- tors are difficult delivery, ductal ligation, and intubation. Examination should determine if obstructive symptoms are present at rest or with agitation, if they are positional, or if they are related to sleep. The presence of agitation, air hunger, severe retractions, cyanosis, lethargy, or coma should alert the physician to a potentially life-threatening condition that may require immediate airway intervention. Helpful diagnostic studies in the evaluation of upper airway obstruction include chest and lateral neck radiographs, air- way fluoroscopy, and barium swallow. In patients who have symptoms of severe chronic obstruction, an electrocardio- gram should be obtained to evaluate for right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea should have polysomnography (measurements during sleep of the motion of the chest wall, airflow at the nose and mouth, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and selected electroencephalographic leads to stage sleep) to determine severity and to evaluate the need for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, oxygen, or continuous or biphasic pos- itive airway pressure. In older children, pulmonary function tests can differentiate fixed from variable airflow obstruction and identify the site of variable obstruction. If noninvasive studies are unable to establish the cause, direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy remain the procedures of choice to estab- lish the precise diagnosis. Treatment should be directed at relieving airway obstruction and correcting the underlying condition if possible. INTRATHORACIC AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION Intrathoracic airway obstruction usually causes expiratory wheezing. The history should include the following: 1. Age at onset 2. Precipitating factors (eg, exercise, upper respiratory ill- nesses, allergens, or choking while eating) 3. Course—acute (bronchiolitis or foreign body), chronic (tracheomalacia or vascular ring), recurrent (asthma), or progressive (CF or bronchiolitis obliterans) 4. Presence and nature of cough 5. Production of sputum 6. Previous response to bronchodilators 7. Symptoms with positional changes (vascular rings) 8. Involvement of other organ systems (malabsorption in CF) Physical examination should include growth measure- ments and vital signs. The examiner should look for cyanosis or pallor, barrel-shaped chest, retractions and use of acces- sory muscles, and clubbing. Auscultation should define the pattern and timing of respiration, detect the presence of crackles and wheezing, and determine whether findings are localized or generalized. Routine tests include plain chest radiographs, a sweat test, and pulmonary function tests in older children. Other diagnostic studies are dictated by the history and physical findings. Treatment should be directed toward the primary cause of the obstruction, but generally includes a trial of bronchodilators. "

LARYNGOMALACIA Laryngomalacia is a benign congenital disorder in which the cartilaginous support for the supraglottic structures is under- developed. It is the most common cause of persistent stridor in infants and usually is seen in the first 6 weeks of life. Stridor has been reported to be worse in the supine position, with increased activity, with upper respiratory infections, and during feeding; however, the clinical presentation can be variable. Patients may have slight oxygen desaturation during sleep. Gastroesophageal reflux may also be associated with laryngomalacia requiring treatment. The condition usually improves with age and resolves by age 2 years, but in some cases symptoms persist for years. The diagnosis is established by direct laryngoscopy, which shows inspiratory collapse of an omega-shaped epiglottis (with or without long, redundant arytenoids). In mildly affected patients with a typical presen- tation (those without stridor at rest or retractions), this procedure may not be necessary. No treatment is usually needed. However, in patients with severe symptoms of airway obstruction associated with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, obstructive sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency, or severe dyspnea, surgical epiglottoplasty may be necessary. Vicencui AG et al: Laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia: Common dynamic airway lesions. Pediatr Rev 2006;27:e33 [PMID: 16581951]. Zoumalan R et al: Etiology of stridor in infants. Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol 2007;116:329 [PMID: 17561760].   CHAPTER 18 478 OTHER CONGENITAL PROBLEMS Other rare congenital lesions of the larynx (laryngeal atresia, laryngeal web, laryngocele and cyst of the larynx, subglottic hemangioma, and laryngeal cleft) are best evaluated by direct laryngoscopy. Laryngeal atresia presents immediately after birth with severe respiratory distress and is usually fatal. Laryngeal web, representing fusion of the anterior portion of the true vocal cords, is associated with hoarseness, aphonia, and stridor. Surgical correction may be necessary depending on the degree of airway obstruction. Congenital cysts and laryngoceles are believed to have similar origin. Cysts are more superficial, whereas laryngo- celes communicate with the interior of the larynx. Cysts are generally fluid-filled, whereas laryngoceles may be air- or fluid-filled. Airway obstruction is usually prominent and requires surgery or laser therapy. Subglottic hemangiomas are seen in infancy with signs of upper airway obstruction and can be associated with similar lesions of the skin (but not always). Although these lesions tend to regress spontaneously, airway obstruction may require surgical treatment or even tracheostomy. Laryngeal cleft is a very rare condition resulting from failure of posterior cricoid fusion. Patients with this condi- tion may have stridor but always aspirate severely, resulting in recurrent or chronic pneumonia and failure to thrive. Barium swallow is always positive for severe aspiration, but diagnosis can be very difficult even with direct laryngoscopy. Patients often require tracheostomy and gastrostomy, because success with surgical correction can be mixed. Vijayasekaran S et al: Open excision of subglottic hemangiomas to avoid tracheostomy.

500,Stridor & Noisy Breathing from Acquired  Disorders of the Extrathoracic Airway,Eye ,1944,"STRIDOR & NOISY BREATHING FROM ACQUIRED  DISORDERS OF THE EXTRATHORACIC AIRWAY ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Presentation with acute or subacute symptoms.  Inspiratory sounds usually of a high-pitched (“croup”) nature but can be variable depending on diagnosis.  Life-threatening condition can occur, requiring careful patient assessment. CROUP SYNDROME Croup describes acute inflammatory diseases of the larynx, including viral croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), epiglottitis (supraglottitis), and bacterial tracheitis. These are the main entities in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with acute stridor, although spasmodic croup, angioneurotic edema, laryngeal or esophageal foreign body, and retropha- ryngeal abscess should be considered as well. 1. Viral Croup Viral croup generally affects younger children in the fall and early winter months and is most often caused by parainfluenza virus serotypes. Other organisms causing croup include respi- ratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, influ- enza virus, rubeola virus, adenovirus, and Mycoplasma pneu- moniae. Although inflammation of the entire airway is usually present, edema formation in the subglottic space accounts for the predominant signs of upper airway obstruction.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Usually a prodrome of upper respiratory tract symptoms is followed by a barking cough and stridor. Fever is usually absent or low-grade but may on occasion be high-grade. Patients with mild disease may have stridor when agitated. As obstruction worsens, stridor occurs at rest, accompanied in severe cases by retractions, air hunger, and cyanosis. On examination, the presence of cough and the absence of drooling favor the diagnosis of viral croup over epiglottitis. B. Imaging Lateral neck radiographs in patients with classic presenta- tions are not required but can be diagnostically supportive by showing subglottic narrowing without the irregularities seen in tracheitis and a normal epiglottis.  Treatment Treatment of viral croup is based on the symptoms. Mild croup, signified by a barking cough and no stridor at rest, requires supportive therapy with oral hydration and mini- mal handling. Mist therapy has historically been used but clinical studies do not demonstrate effectiveness. Conversely, patients with stridor at rest require active intervention. Oxygen should be administered to patients with oxygen desaturation. Nebulized racemic epinephrine (2.25% solu- tion; 0.05 mL/kg to a maximum of 1.5 mL diluted in sterile saline) is commonly used because it has a rapid onset of action within 10–30 minutes. Both racemic epinephrine and epinephrine hydrochloride are effective in alleviating symp- toms and decreasing the need for intubation. Once controversial, the efficacy of glucocorticoids in croup is now more firmly established. Dexamethasone, 0.6 mg/kg intramuscularly as one dose, improves symptoms, reduces the duration of hospitalizations and frequency of intubations, and permits earlier discharge from the emergency department. Oral dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) appears equally effective.   CHAPTER 18 482 VASCULAR RINGS & SLINGS The most common vascular anomaly to compress the trachea or esophagus is a vascular ring. A vascular ring can be formed by a double aortic arch, a right aortic arch with left ligamentum arteriosum, or a patent ductus arteriosus. The pulmonary sling is created when the left pulmonary artery branches off from the right pulmonary artery. Other common vascular anomalies include an anomalous innominate, a left carotid artery, and an aberrant right subclavian artery. All but the right subclavian artery can cause tracheal compression and present in infancy with symptoms of chronic airway obstruction (stridor, coarse wheezing, and croupy cough). Symptoms are often worse in the supine position. Respiratory compromise is most severe with double aortic arch and may lead to apnea, respiratory arrest, or even death. Esophageal compression, present in all but anomalous innominate or carotid artery, may result in feeding difficulties, including dysphagia and vomiting. Barium swallow showing esophageal compression is the mainstay of diagnosis. Chest radiographs and echocardiograms may miss abnormalities. Anatomy can be further defined by angiogra- phy, chest CT with contrast, MRI or magnetic resonance angiography, or bronchoscopy. Patients with significant symptoms require surgical cor- rection, especially those with double aortic arch. Patients usually improve following correction but may have persis- tent but milder symptoms of airway obstruction due to associated tracheomalacia.

BRONCHOGENIC CYSTS Bronchogenic cysts generally occur in the middle mediastinum (see later section on Mediastinal Masses) near the carina and adjacent to the major bronchi but can be found elsewhere in the lung. They range in size from 2–10 cm. Cyst walls are thin and may contain pus, mucus, or blood. Cysts develop from abnor- mal lung budding of the primitive foregut. They can be seen in involvement with other congenital pulmonary malformations such as pulmonary sequestration or lobar emphysema. Clinically, respiratory distress can appear acutely in early childhood due to airway compression or infection of the bronchogenic cyst or they may remain asymptomatic into adulthood. Symptoms may include chronic wheezing, chronic cough, tachypnea, recurrent pneumonia, or stridor, depend- ing on the location and size of the cysts and the degree of airway compression. However, all asymptomatic cysts will eventually become symptomatic with chest pain being the most common presenting complaint. On examination, the trachea may deviate from the midline, breath sounds over such areas will be decreased, and percussion over involved lobes may be hyperresonant due to air trapping. The choice of diagnostic studies for bronchogenic cysts is controversial. Chest radiographs can show air trapping and hyperinflation of the affected lobes or may show a spherical lesion with or without an air-fluid level. However, early detected or smaller lesions may not be seen on chest radio- graphs. CT scan is the preferred imaging study and can differentiate solid versus cystic mediastinal masses and define the cyst’s relationship to the airways and the rest of the lung. A barium swallow can help determine whether the lesion communicates with the gastrointestinal tract. MRI and ultrasound are other imaging modalities used. Treatment is surgical resection. Postoperatively, vigorous pulmonary physiotherapy is required to prevent complica- tions (atelectasis or infection of the lung distal to the site of resection of the cyst).

ACQUIRED DISORDERS OF  THE INTRATHORACIC AIRWAYS FOREIGN BODY ASPIRATION Aspiration of a foreign body into the respiratory tract is rarely observed. Onset is generally abrupt, with a history of the child running with food in the mouth or playing with seeds, small coins, or toys. Symptoms at the time of the ingestion are often abrupt and include cough, choking, or wheezing. The foreign body can lodge itself anywhere along the respira- tory tract. Often it is trapped in the supraglottic airway, triggering protective reflexes that result in laryngospasm. Small objects such as coins may pass through the glottis and obstruct the trachea. Finally, foreign bodies that lodge in the esophagus may compress the airway and cause dysphagia and respiratory distress. The most commonly seen objects in foreign body aspira- tion include peanuts, hot dogs, popcorn, small coins, hard candy, and small toys. Children aged 6 months to 4 years are at highest risk, and many deaths are caused by foreign body aspiration and airway obstruction each year. 1.

Foreign Bodies in the  Upper Respiratory Tract ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Sudden onset of coughing or respiratory distress.  Difficulty vocalizing.  RESPIRATORY TRACT & MEDIASTINUM 483  Clinical Findings The diagnosis is established by acute onset of choking along with inability to vocalize or cough and cyanosis with marked distress (complete obstruction), or with drooling, stridor, and ability to vocalize (partial obstruction). Foreign bodies that lodge in the esophagus may compress the airway and cause respiratory distress. More typically, the foreign body lodges in the supraglottic airway, triggering protective reflexes that result in laryngospasm. Onset is generally abrupt, with a history of the child running with food in the mouth or playing with seeds, small coins, toys, and the like. Homes and child care centers in which an older sibling or child feeds age-inappropriate foods (eg, peanuts, hard candy, or carrot slices) to the younger child are typical. Without treatment, progressive cyanosis, loss of conscious- ness, seizures, bradycardia, and cardiopulmonary arrest can follow.  Treatment The emergency treatment of upper airway obstruction due to foreign body aspiration is somewhat controversial. If complete obstruction is present, then one must intervene immediately. If partial obstruction is present, then the chok- ing subject should be allowed to use his or her own cough reflex to remove the foreign body. If after a brief observation period the obstruction increases or the airway becomes completely obstructed, acute intervention is required. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association distinguish between children younger than and older than age 1 year. A choking infant younger than age 1 year should be placed face down over the rescuer’s arm, with the head positioned below the trunk. Five measured back blows are delivered rapidly between the infant’s scapulas with the heel of the rescuer’s hand. If obstruction persists, the infant should be rolled over and five rapid chest com- pressions performed (similar to cardiopulmonary resuscita- tion). This sequence is repeated until the obstruction is relieved. In a choking child older than age 1 year, abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) may be performed, with spe- cial care in younger children because of concern about possible intra-abdominal organ injury. Blind finger sweeps should not be performed in infants or children because the finger may actually push the foreign body further into the airway causing further obstruction. The airway may be opened by jaw thrust, and if the foreign body can be directly visualized, careful removal with the fingers or instruments (Magill forceps) can be attempted. Patients with persistent apnea and inability to achieve ade- quate ventilation may require emergency intubation, trache- otomy, or needle cricothyrotomy, depending on the setting and the rescuer’s skills. Ralston M et al (editors): Pediatric Advanced Life Support Provider Manual. American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006. 2. Foreign Bodies in the  Lower Respiratory Tract ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Sudden onset of coughing, wheezing, or respiratory distress.  Asymmetrical physical findings of decreased breath sounds or localized wheezing.  Asymmetrical radiographic findings, especially with forced expiratory view.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Respiratory symptoms and signs vary depending on the site of obstruction and the duration following the acute episode. For example, a large or central airway obstruction may cause marked distress. The acute cough or wheezing caused by a foreign body in the lower respiratory tract may diminish over time only to recur later as chronic cough or persistent wheezing, monophonic wheezing, asymmetrical breath sounds on chest examination, or recurrent pneumonia in one location. Foreign body aspiration should be suspected in children with chronic cough, persistent wheezing, or recur- rent pneumonia. Long-standing foreign bodies may lead to bronchiectasis or lung abscess. Hearing asymmetrical breath sounds or localized wheezing also suggests a foreign body. B. Imaging Inspiratory and forced expiratory (obtained by manually compressing the abdomen during expiration) chest radio- graphs should be obtained if foreign body aspiration is suspected. Chest radiographs may be normal up to 25% of the time. If abnormal, the initial inspiratory view may show localized hyperinflation due to the ball-valve effect of the foreign body, causing distal air trapping or aeration within an area of atelectasis. A positive forced expiratory study shows a mediastinal shift away from the affected side. If airway obstruction is complete, atelectasis and related vol- ume loss will be the major radiologic findings. Lateral decubitus views may be helpful if the child is too young to cooperate. Chest fluoroscopy is an alternative approach for detecting air trapping and mediastinal shift.  Treatment When a foreign body is highly suspected, a normal chest radiograph should not rule out the possibility of an airway foreign body. If clinical suspicion persists based on two of three findings—history of possible aspiration, focal abnor- mal lung examination, or an abnormal chest radiograph—  CHAPTER 18 484 then a bronchoscopy is indicated. Rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is recommended. Flexible bronchoscopy may be helpful for follow-up evaluations (after the foreign object has been removed). Children with suspected acute foreign body aspiration should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation and treat- ment. Chest postural drainage is no longer recommended because the foreign body may become dislodged and obstruct a major central airway. Bronchoscopy should not be delayed in children with respiratory distress but should be performed as soon as the diagnosis is made—even in chil- dren with more chronic symptoms. Following the removal of the foreign body, β-adrenergic nebulization treatments fol- lowed by chest physiotherapy are recommended to help clear related mucus or treat bronchospasm. Failure to identify a foreign body in the lower respiratory tract can result in bronchiectasis or lung abscess. This risk justifies an aggres- sive approach to suspected foreign bodies in suspicious cases. Chiu CY et al: Factors predicting early diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in children.

BRONCHIOLITIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Clinical syndrome characterized by one or more of the following findings: coughing, tachypnea, labored breath- ing, and hypoxia.  Irritability, poor feeding, vomiting.  Wheezing and crackles on chest auscultation. Bronchiolitis is the most common serious acute respiratory illness in infants and young children. One to 3% of infants with bronchiolitis will require hospitalization, especially dur- ing the winter months. The typical presentation is acute onset of tachypnea, cough, and expiratory wheezing after 1–2 days of rhinorrhea. RSV is by far the most common viral cause of acute bronchiolitis. Parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, influenza, adenovirus, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Ureaplasma, and Pneumocystis are less common causes of bronchiolitis during early infancy. Major concerns include not only the acute effects of bronchiolitis but also the possible develop- ment of chronic airway hyperreactivity (asthma). Bronchioli- tis due to RSV infection contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality in children with underlying medical disorders, including chronic lung disease of prematurity, CF, congenital heart disease, and immunodeficiency.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The usual course of RSV bronchiolitis is 1–2 days of fever, rhinorrhea, and cough, followed by wheezing, tachypnea, and respiratory distress. Typically the breathing pattern is shallow, with rapid respirations. Nasal flaring, cyanosis, retractions, and rales may be present, along with prolonga- tion of the expiratory phase and wheezing, depending on the severity of illness. Some young infants present with apnea and few findings on auscultation but may subsequently develop rales, rhonchi, and expiratory wheezing. B. Laboratory Findings and Imaging A viral nasal wash may be performed to identify the causative pathogen but is not necessary to make the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The peripheral white blood cell count may be normal or may show a mild lymphocytosis. Chest radio- graphic findings are generally nonspecific and typically include hyperinflation, peribronchial cuffing, increased interstitial markings, and subsegmental atelectasis.  Prevention & Treatment The most effective prevention against RSV infection is to use proper handwashing techniques and to reduce exposure to potential environmental risk factors. Major challenges have impeded the development of an RSV vaccine, but a licensed product may be expected in the near future. Prophylaxis with a monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) has proven effec- tive in reducing the rate of hospitalization and associated morbidities in high-risk premature infants and those with chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Although most children with RSV bronchiolitis are readily treated as outpatients, hospitalization is required in infected children with hypoxemia on room air, a history of apnea, moderate tachypnea with feeding difficulties, and marked respiratory distress with retractions. Children at high risk for hospitalization include young infants (under 6 months of age), especially with any history of prematurity, and those with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disor- ders. While in the hospital, treatment should include sup- portive strategies such as frequent suctioning and providing adequate fluids to maintain hydration. If hypoxemia is present, supplemental oxygen should be administered. Although bronchodilators and corticosteroids may attenuate airway obstruction, their use remains controversial and empiric, and patients should be assessed individually to determine responsiveness. In immunocompromised patients, especially bone mar- row transplant recipients, a combination of RSV intravenous immune globulin and the antiviral ribavirin has been tried. "

Lancet 2006;368:312 [PMID: 16860701]. DISORDERS OF MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE Mucociliary clearance is the primary defense mechanism for the lung. Inhaled particles including microbial pathogens are entrapped in mucus on the airway surface, then cleared by the coordinated action of cilia. The volume and composition of airway surface liquid influence the efficiency of ciliary function and mucus clearance. The two main genetic dis- eases of mucociliary clearance involve disorders of ion trans- port (cystic fibrosis, CF) and disorders in ciliary function (primary ciliary dyskinesia, PCD). CYSTIC FIBROSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Greasy, bulky, malodorous stools; failure to thrive.  Recurrent respiratory infections.  Digital clubbing on examination.  Bronchiectasis on chest imaging.  Sweat chloride > 60 mmol/L.  General Considerations CF, an autosomal recessive disease, results in a syndrome of chronic sinopulmonary infections, malabsorption, and nutritional abnormalities. It is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases in the United States, with an incidence of approximately 1:3000 among Caucasians. Although CF is characterized by abnormalities in the hepatic, gastrointesti- nal, and male reproductive systems, lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Most individuals with CF develop obstructive lung disease associated with chronic infection that leads to progressive loss of pulmo- nary function. The cause of CF is a defect in a single gene on chromo- some 7 that encodes a cyclic adenosine monophosphate– regulated chloride channel called the cystic fibrosis trans- membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR functions primarily as an ion channel and controls the movement of salt and water into and out of epithelial cells lining the airways, biliary tree, intestines, vas deferens, sweat ducts, and pancreatic ducts. Approximately 1500 disease- causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified. The most common mutation, ΔF508, is a deletion of three base pairs. This and other gene mutations lead to defects or deficiencies in CFTR, causing problems in salt and water movement across cell membranes, resulting in abnormally thick secretions in various organ systems and critically alter- ing host defense in the lung.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Approximately 15% of newborns with CF present at birth with meconium ileus, a severe intestinal obstruction result- ing from inspissation of tenacious meconium in the terminal ileum. Meconium ileus is virtually diagnostic of CF, so the infant should be treated presumptively as having CF until a sweat test or genotyping can be obtained. During infancy and beyond, a common presentation of CF is failure to thrive. These children fail to gain weight despite good appetite and typically have frequent, bulky, foul-smelling, oily stools. These symptoms are the result of severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, the failure of the pancreas to produce sufficient digestive enzymes to allow breakdown and absorption of fats and protein. Pancreatic insufficiency occurs in over 85% of persons with CF. (Chap- ter 21 describes gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary manifesta- tions of CF; see also Table 21–9 there.) Infants with undiag- nosed CF may also present with hypoproteinemia with or without edema, anemia, and deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, because of ongoing steatorrhea. From a respiratory standpoint, clinical manifestations include productive cough, wheezing, chronic bronchitis and recurrent pneumonias, progressive obstructive airways dis- ease, exercise intolerance, dyspnea, hemoptysis, anorexia, and weight loss. CF lung disease is characterized by a cycle of chronic, persistent infections with CF-related pathogens and an excessive inflammatory response that progressively dam- ages the airways and lung parenchyma. This results in a characteristic airflow obstruction on lung function testing and bronchiectasis and other structural lung abnormalities on chest imaging (best demonstrated by high-resolution CT scans). Airway infection with bacteria, including S aureus and H influenzae, often begins in the first few months of life,  CHAPTER 18 486 even in asymptomatic infants. Eventually, Pseudomonas aeruginosa becomes the predominant pathogen. Acquisition of the characteristic mucoid Pseudomonas is associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary function. An acute change in respiratory signs and symptoms from the subject’s baseline is generically termed a pulmonary exacerbation. Clinically, an exacerbation is typically mani- fested by increased cough and sputum production, decreased exercise tolerance, malaise, and anorexia. These symptoms are usually associated with decreased measures of lung func- tion, new chest radiographic findings, or both. Treatment for pulmonary exacerbations generally consists of antibiotics and augmented airway clearance. CF should also be considered in infants and children who present with severe dehydration and hypochloremic alkalo- sis. Other findings that should prompt a diagnostic evalua- tion for CF include unexplained bronchiectasis, rectal pro- lapse, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, and unexplained pancreatitis or cirrhosis. B. Diagnostic Studies The diagnosis of CF is made by a sweat chloride concentra- tion greater than 60 mmol/L in the presence of one or more typical clinical features (chronic sinopulmonary disease, pan- creatic insufficiency, salt loss syndromes) or an appropriate family history (sibling or first cousin who has CF). The most acceptable type of sweat test is performed by iontophoresis of pilocarpine into the skin to stimulate sweating. Sweat then is collected and analyzed for chloride. This test should be performed at a CF Foundation–accredited laboratory. A diag- nosis can also be confirmed by genotyping that reveals two alleles that have CF-causing mutations. Many states now perform newborn screening for CF by measuring immunore- active trypsin (IRT), a pancreatic enzyme, in blood. Most infants with CF have elevated IRT in the newborn period. In newborns with elevated IRT, the diagnosis of CF must then be confirmed by sweat testing, mutation analysis, or both.  Treatment It is strongly recommended that individuals with CF be fol- lowed at a CF Foundation–accredited CF care center (http:// www.cff.org). The cornerstone of gastrointestinal treatment is pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Persons with CF are required to take pancreatic enzyme capsules immediately prior to each meal and with snacks. Occasionally, enzyme supplementation alone does not control the malabsorption, and antacids are added to the regimen. Individuals should also take daily multivitamins that contain vitamins A, D, E, and K. Moreover, caloric supple- ments are often added to the patient’s diet to optimize growth. Airway clearance therapy and aggressive antibiotic use form the mainstays of treatment for CF lung disease. Antibi- otic therapy appears to be one of the primary reasons for the increased life expectancy of persons with CF. Three evi- dence-based medications that are now routinely used in many persons with CF are an inhaled mucolytic agent, recombinant human DNAse (Pulmozyme), inhaled tobra- mycin (TOBI), and oral azithromycin for those with chronic Pseudomonas infection. These therapies have been shown to maintain lung function and reduce the need for hospitaliza- tions and intravenous antibiotics. Bronchodilators and anti- inflammatory therapies are also frequently used.  Prognosis A few decades ago, CF was fatal in early childhood. Now the median life expectancy is around 35 years of age. The rate of lung disease progression usually determines survival. Lung transplantation may be performed in those with end-stage lung disease. In addition, new treatments, including gene therapy trials and agents that modulate CFTR protein func- tion, are being developed based on improved understanding of the disease at the cellular and molecular levels.

PRIMARY CILIARY DYSKINESIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, and otitis.  Situs inversus in approximately 50% of cases.  Unexplained respiratory distress in the newborn period.  Consistent ultrastructural defect of cilia demonstrated by electron microscopy.  General Considerations PCD, also known as immotile cilia syndrome or Kartagener syndrome, is a human genetic disease associated with abnor- mal ciliary structure and function. Occurring in approxi- mately 1 in 15,000 births, PCD is an inherited disease that causes impaired clearance of bacteria from the lung, paranasal sinuses, and middle ear. Half of the patients with PCD have their internal organs reversed (situs abnormalities), and men are usually infertile.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Children with PCD have a variety of clinical features includ- ing chronic productive cough, wheezing, nasal congestion  RESPIRATORY TRACT & MEDIASTINUM 487 and rhinorrhea, chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumo- nias. Recurrent, chronic otitis media is a serious problem, and hearing loss is common. A history of transient neonatal respiratory distress and unexplained atelectasis in the new- born period is frequently elicited. Approximately 50% of PCD patients have situs inversus totalis or other organ rotation abnormalities, suggesting a role for embryonic cilia in the rotation of internal organs. The diagnosis of PCD should also be considered in any patients with unexplained bronchiectasis or in males with infertility issues. B. Diagnostic Studies The diagnosis of PCD currently requires a compatible clini- cal phenotype and specific ultrastructural defects of the cilia detected by transmission electron microscopy. Cilia samples may be obtained from either the upper airways (nasal pas- sage) or lower airways (trachea). Semen collection from older male patients can also be obtained to analyze sperm tails, which have the same ultrastructure as cilia. Significant expertise is required to produce high-quality transmission electron micrographs of cilia, and to distinguish primary (genetic) defects from secondary (acquired) defects in ciliary ultrastructure. Functional assessments of cilia consist of crude measures of nasal mucociliary clearance (the saccharin test), or measures of lung mucociliary clearance, using radio- isotopic techniques. The current limitations in diagnosis of PCD provide a compelling case to define disease-causing genetic mutations, which will allow great improvement in the identification and diagnosis of PCD through genetic testing. Although structural and functional assessments of cilia have been the diagnostic gold standard in PCD diagno- sis, nasal nitric oxide has the potential to become a useful adjunctive diagnostic test for PCD. Recent studies have demonstrated extremely low levels of nasal nitric oxide in persons with PCD, suggesting that nasal nitric oxide could be used as a screening test for PCD.  Treatment At present, no specific therapies are available to correct the ciliary dysfunction in PCD. Management includes aggres- sive airway clearance therapy and frequent courses of anti- biotics to treat bacterial infections in the airways, sinuses, and middle ear. No randomized clinical trials have been conducted in this disease because it is so rare and most centers follow only a few PCD patients. A national consor- tium has been created to improve diagnostic techniques for PCD, including genetic testing to better define the patho- genesis of PCD and study treatments in this population (http://rarediseasesnetwork.epi.usf.edu/).  Prognosis The progression of lung disease in PCD is quite variable and for most affected individuals is less severe than in CF. Impor- tantly, though, persons with PCD are at risk for chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis. With monitoring and aggressive treatment during times of illness, most individuals with PCD should experience a normal or near-normal life span. Bush A, O’Callaghan C: Primary ciliary dyskinesia.

BRONCHIECTASIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Chronic cough with sputum production.  Rhonchi or wheezes (or both) on chest auscultation.  Diagnosis is confirmed by high-resolution CT scan.  General Considerations Bronchiectasis is the permanent dilation of bronchi. The dilation may be regular, with the airway continuing to have a smooth outline (cylindric bronchiectasis); irregular, with areas of dilation and constriction (varicose bronchiectasis); or marked, with destruction of structural components of the airway wall (saccular or cystic bronchiectasis). Bronchiectasis results from airway obstruction by retained mucus secretions or inflammation in response to chronic or repeated infection. It occurs either as a consequence of a preceding illness (severe pneumonia or foreign body aspira- tion) or as a manifestation of an underlying systemic disorder (CF, PCD, or immunodeficiency).  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Persons with bronchiectasis will typically have chronic cough, purulent sputum, fever, and weight loss. Recurrent respiratory infections and dyspnea on exertion are also common. Hemoptysis occurs less frequently in children than in adults with bronchiectasis. On physical examination, finger clubbing may be seen. Rales, rhonchi, and decreased air entry are often noted over the bronchiectatic areas. B. Laboratory Findings and Imaging Cultures from the lower respiratory tract usually reveal normal oropharyngeal flora. These include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and nontypeable H influ- enzae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can also be found in children with bronchiectasis, even in those without CF. Chest radiographs may be mildly abnormal with slightly increased bronchovascular markings or areas of atelectasis, or  CHAPTER 18 488 they may demonstrate cystic changes in one or more areas of the lung. The extent of bronchiectasis is best defined by high- resolution CT scan of the lung, which often reveals far wider involvement of lung than expected from the plain chest radiograph. Pulmonary function testing often reveals airflow obstruction. Evaluation of lung function after use of a bron- chodilator is helpful in assessing the benefit a patient may have from bronchodilators. Serial assessments of lung func- tion help define the progression or resolution of the disease.  Differential Diagnosis Bronchiectasis has numerous causes. It can occur following severe respiratory tract infections by bacteria (Bordetella pertussis), viruses (adenovirus), or other organisms (Myco- bacterium tuberculosis). Bronchiectasis is commonly seen in persons with CF, PCD, immunodeficiency, and collagen- vascular conditions. Other diagnostic considerations include foreign body aspiration, chronic aspiration of gastric or oropharyngeal contents, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.  Treatment Aggressive antibiotic therapy during pulmonary exacerba- tions and routine airway clearance are mainstays of treat- ment. Inhaled mucolytic agents and bronchodilators may also be of benefit in individual patients. Surgical removal of an area of lung affected with severe bronchiectasis is considered when the response to medical therapy is poor. Other indications for operation include severe localized disease, repeated hemoptysis, and recurrent pneumonia in one area of lung. If bronchiectasis is wide- spread, surgical resection offers little advantage.  Prognosis The prognosis depends on the underlying cause and severity of bronchiectasis, the extent of lung involvement, and the response to medical management. Good pulmonary hygiene and avoidance of infectious complications in the involved areas of lung may reverse cylindric bronchiectasis. Barker AF: Bronchiectasis.

BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS Bronchiolitis obliterans is characterized by partial or com- plete occlusion of the lumens of terminal and respiratory bronchioles by inflammatory and fibrous tissue. This condi- tion follows damage to the lower respiratory tract from any of a number of insults, such as inhalation of toxic gases, infections (adenovirus, influenza virus, rubeola virus, Borde- tella, or Mycoplasma), connective tissue diseases, transplan- tation, and aspiration. Bronchiolitis obliterans may also develop in children who have Stevens-Johnson syndrome with pulmonary involvement. Many cases of bronchiolitis obliterans are idiopathic. Adenovirus-induced bronchiolitis obliterans occurs more frequently in the Native American population.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia following an episode of acute pneumonia or bronchiolitis. B. Laboratory Findings and Imaging Chest radiograph abnormalities include evidence of localized or generalized air trapping as well as (in some cases) nodular densities and alveolar opacification. Scattered areas of matched decreases in ventilation and perfusion are seen when the lung is scanned. Pulmonary angiograms reveal decreased vasculature in involved lung, and bronchograms show marked pruning of the bronchial tree. An assessment of lung function demonstrates an obstructive process that may be combined with evidence of restriction. Inhaled bronchodilators or corticosteroids provide little improve- ment in lung function.  Differential Diagnosis Poorly treated asthma, CF, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia must be considered in children with persistent airway obstruction. A trial of medications (including bronchodila- tors and corticosteroids) may help to determine the revers- ibility of the process when the primary differential is between asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans. Although the results of imaging and pulmonary function testing are very suggestive, the most definitive way to establish a diagnosis is by lung biopsy.  Complications Sequelae of bronchiolitis obliterans include persistent airway obstruction, recurrent wheezing, bronchiectasis, chronic atelectasis, recurrent pneumonia, and unilateral hyperlucent lung syndrome.  Treatment Supplemental oxygen should be given to patients with oxy- gen desaturation during normal activities or sleep. In addi- tion, early treatment should be directed at preventing ongo- ing airway damage due to problems such as aspiration, which may be either the primary insult or an acquired problem secondary to marked hyperinflation. The effective-  RESPIRATORY TRACT & MEDIASTINUM 489 ness of other forms of treatment may be more difficult to evaluate. Oral and inhaled bronchodilators may reverse airway obstruction if the disease has a reactive component. Many children also receive at least one course of corticoster- oid treatment in an attempt to reverse the obstruction or prevent ongoing damage. Antibiotics should be used as indicated for pneumonia.  Prognosis Prognosis may depend in part on the underlying cause as well as the age at which the insult occurred. The course varies from mild asthma-like symptoms to rapidly fatal deteriora- tion despite therapy. Kurland G, Michelson P: Bronchiolitis obliterans in children. Pediatr Pulmonol 2005;39:193 [PMID: 15635614]. BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Acute respiratory distress in the first week of life.  Required oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, with persistent oxygen requirement at 36 weeks’ gestational age.  Persistent respiratory abnormalities, including physical signs and radiographic findings.  General Considerations Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains one of the most significant sequelae of acute respiratory distress in the neonatal intensive care unit, with an incidence of about 30% for infants with a birth weight of less than 1000 g. This disease was first characterized in 1967 when Northway and coworkers reported the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings in a group of premature newborns that required prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to treat hyaline membrane disease. The progression from acute hyaline membrane disease to chronic lung disease was divided into four stages: acute respiratory distress shortly after birth, usually hyaline membrane disease (stage I); clinical and radiographic worsening of the acute lung dis- ease, often due to increased pulmonary blood flow secondary to a patent ductus arteriosus (stage II); and progressive signs of chronic lung disease (stages III and IV). The pathologic findings and clinical course of BPD in recent years have changed due to a combination of new therapies (surfactants, prenatal glucocorticoids, and differ- ent ventilation strategies) and increased survival of infants born at earlier gestational ages. Although the incidence of BPD has not changed, the severity of the lung disease has decreased. Pathologically this “new” BPD is characterized by a reduction in inflammation, decreased alveolar number, and a dysmorphic vascular structure.  Pathogenesis The precise mechanism that results in the development of BPD is unclear. The premature lung makes insufficient func- tional surfactant; furthermore, the antioxidant defense mech- anisms are not sufficiently mature to protect the lung from the toxic oxygen metabolites, and lungs destined to develop BPD show early inflammation and hypercellularity followed by healing with fibrosis. Thus abnormal lung mechanics due to structural immaturity, surfactant deficiency, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema—plus lung injury secondary to hyper- oxia and mechanical ventilation—lead to further abnormali- ties of lung function, causing increases in ventilator and oxygen requirements and resulting in a vicious cycle that compounds the progression of lung injury. Excessive fluid administration, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary intersti- tial emphysema, pneumothorax, infection, pulmonary hyper- tension, and inflammatory stimuli secondary to lung injury or infection also play important roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. Although the exact mechanisms are not com- pletely understood, BPD represents the consequences of lung injury caused by oxygen toxicity, barotrauma, and inflamma- tion superimposed on a susceptible, generally immature lung.  Clinical Findings A recent summary of a National Institutes of Health work- shop on BPD proposes a definition of the disease that includes oxygen requirement for more than 28 days, a history of positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure, and gestational age. The new definition accommo- dates several key observations regarding the disease, as fol- lows: (1) although most of these children were premature and had hyaline membrane disease, full-term newborns with such disorders as meconium aspiration or persistent pulmo- nary hypertension can also develop bronchopulmonary dys- plasia; (2) some extremely preterm newborns require mini- mal ventilator support yet subsequently develop a prolonged oxygen requirement despite the absence of severe acute manifestations of respiratory failure; (3) newborns dying within the first weeks of life can already have the aggressive, fibroproliferative pathologic lesions that resemble broncho- pulmonary dysplasia; and (4) physiologic abnormalities (increased airway resistance) and biochemical markers of lung injury (altered protease-antiprotease ratios, and increased inflammatory cells and mediators), which may be predictive of BPD, are already present in the first week of life.  Differential Diagnosis The radiologic appearance of BPD is changing, and severe chronic lung findings of fibrosis with infiltrate are less common. The changes in severe BPD necessitate ruling out  CHAPTER 18 490 meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital infection (eg, with cytomegalovirus or Ureaplasma), cystic adenomatoid malformation, recurrent aspiration, pulmonary lymphan- giectasia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, over- hydration, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Treatment A. Clinical Course The clinical course of infants with BPD ranges from a mild increased oxygen requirement that gradually resolves over a few months to more severe disease requiring chronic tra- cheostomy and mechanical ventilation for the first 2 years of life. In general, patients show slow, steady improvements in oxygen or ventilator requirements but can have frequent respiratory exacerbations leading to frequent and pro- longed hospitalizations. Clinical management generally includes careful attention to growth, nutrition (caloric requirements of infants with oxygen dependence and respi- ratory distress are quite high), metabolic status, develop- mental and neurologic status, and related problems, along with the various cardiopulmonary abnormalities described in a later discussion. B. Corticosteroid Therapy Short courses of postnatal glucocorticoid therapy have been helpful in increasing the success of weaning from the venti- lator. Longer courses of postnatal glucocorticoids have been linked to an increased incidence of cerebral palsy. Inhaled glucocorticoids may help reduce the need for systemic ster- oids, but the overall incidence of BPD has not been affected. Early use of surfactant therapy with adequate lung recruit- ment increases the chance for survival without BPD and can decrease the overall mortality and reduce the need for ventilation. Thus early interventions are important prior to the development of BPD to decrease morbidity and mortal- ity. Inhaled corticosteroids together with occasional use of β-adrenergic agonists are commonly part of the treatment plan. Part of the rationale for the use of corticosteroids is to decrease lung inflammation and enhance responsiveness to β-adrenergic drugs, as in the treatment of severe asthma. β-Adrenergic agonists followed by chest physiotherapy are often used for the thick secretions that may contribute to airway obstruction or recurrent atelectasis. C. Airway Evaluation Children with significant stridor, sleep apnea, chronic wheezing, or excessive respiratory distress need diagnostic bronchoscopy to evaluate for structural lesions (eg, subglot- tic stenosis, vocal cord paralysis, tracheal stenosis, tracheo- malacia, bronchial stenosis, and granulomatous bronchial polyps). In addition, the contribution of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration should be considered in the face of worsening chronic lung disease. D. Diuretic Therapy Salt and water retention secondary to chronic hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or other stimuli may be present. Chronic or intermittent diuretic therapy is commonly used if rales or signs of persistent pulmonary edema are present, and clinical studies show acute improvement in lung function with this therapy. Unfortunately, diuretics often have adverse effects, including severe volume contraction, hypokalemia, alkalosis, and hyponatremia. Potassium and arginine chloride supple- ments are commonly required. E. Management of Pulmonary Hypertension Infants with BPD are at risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, and in many of these children even mild hypoxemia can cause significant elevations of pulmonary arterial pressure. To minimize the harmful effects of hypox- emia, the arterial oxygen saturation should be kept above 93%, with care to avoid hyperoxia during retinal vascular development. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic studies should be performed to monitor for the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. If hypertrophy persists or if it develops where it was not previously present, intermittent hypoxemia should be considered and further assessments of oxygenation pursued, especially while the infant sleeps. Infants with a history of intubation can develop obstructive sleep apnea secondary to a high-arched palate or subglottic narrowing. Barium swallow, esophageal pH probe studies, bronchoscopy, and cardiac catheterization will diagnose unsuspected cardiac or pulmonary lesions that contribute to the underlying pathophysiology, such as aspiration, tracheo- malacia, obstructive sleep apnea, and anatomic cardiac lesions. Long-term care should include monitoring for sys- temic hypertension and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. F. Nutrition Nutritional problems in infants may be due to increased oxy- gen consumption, feeding difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic hypoxemia. Hypercaloric formulas and gastrosto- mies are often required to ensure adequate intake while avoid- ing overhydration. Influenza vaccination is recommended. With the onset of acute wheezing secondary to suspected viral infection, rapid diagnostic testing for RSV infection may facili- tate early treatment. Immune prophylaxis of RSV reduces the morbidity of bronchiolitis in infants with BPD. G. Ventilation For children who remain ventilator-dependent, attempts should be made to maintain PaCO2 below 60 mm Hg—even when pH is normal—because of the potential adverse effects of hypercapnia on salt and water retention, cardiac function, and perhaps pulmonary vascular tone. Changes in ventilator settings in children with severe lung disease should be slow, "
513,Congenital Malformations of the Lung,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,3819,"CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS OF THE LUNG What follows is a brief description of selected congenital pulmonary malformations. PULMONARY AGENESIS & HYPOPLASIA With unilateral pulmonary agenesis (complete absence of one lung), the trachea continues into a main bronchus and often has complete tracheal rings. The left lung is affected more often than the right. With compensatory postnatal growth, the remaining lung often herniates into the contra- lateral chest. Chest radiographs show a mediastinal shift toward the affected side, and vertebral abnormalities may be present. Absent or incomplete lung development may be associated with other congenital abnormalities, such as absence of one or both kidneys or fusion of ribs, and the outcome is primarily related to the severity of associated lesions. About 50% of patients survive; the mortality rate is higher with agenesis of the right lung than of the left lung. This difference is probably not related to the higher inci- dence of associated anomalies but rather to a greater shift in the mediastinum that leads to tracheal compression and distortion of vascular structures. Pulmonary hypoplasia is incomplete development of one or both lungs, characterized by a reduction in alveolar num- ber and a reduction in airway branches. Pulmonary hypopla- sia is present in up to 10–15% of perinatal autopsies. The hypoplasia can be a result of an intrathoracic mass, resulting in lack of space for the lungs to grow; decreased size of the thorax; decreased fetal breathing movements; decreased blood flow to the lungs; or possibly a primary mesodermal defect affecting multiple organ systems. Congenital diaphrag- matic hernia is the most common cause, with an incidence of 1:2200 births. Other causes include extralobar sequestration, diaphragmatic eventration or hypoplasia, thoracic neuroblas- toma, fetal hydrops, and fetal hydrochylothorax. Chest cage abnormalities, diaphragmatic elevation, oligohydramnios, chromosomal abnormalities, severe musculoskeletal disor- ders, and cardiac lesions may also result in hypoplastic lungs. Postnatal factors may play important roles. For example, infants with advanced BPD can have pulmonary hypoplasia.   CHAPTER 18 494 B. Imaging With type 1 lesions, chest radiograph shows an intrapulmo- nary mass of soft tissue density with scattered radiolucent areas of varying sizes and shapes, usually with a mediastinal shift and pulmonary herniation. Placement of a radiopaque feeding tube into the stomach helps in the differentiation from diaphragmatic hernia. Type 2 lesions appear similar except that the cysts are smaller. Type 3 lesions may appear as a solid homogeneous mass filling the hemithorax and causing a marked mediastinal shift. Differentiation from sequestration is not difficult because congenital cystic ade- nomatoid malformations have no systemic blood supply.  Treatment Treatment of type 1 and 3 lesions involves surgical removal of the affected lobe. Resection is often indicated because of the risk of infection and air trapping, since the malformation communicates with the tracheobronchial tree but mucous clearance is compromised. Because type 2 lesions are often associated with other severe anomalies, management may be more complex. Segmental resection is not feasible because smaller cysts may expand after removal of the more obvi- ously affected area. Cystic adenomatoid malformations have been reported to have malignant potential; therefore, expec- tant management with observation alone should proceed with caution. Recent development of intrauterine surgery for congenital malformations has led to promising results. Breckenridge RL et al: Congenital cystic adenomatoid malforma- tion of the lung.

516,Acquired Disorders Involving Alveoli,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,2156,"ACQUIRED DISORDERS INVOLVING ALVEOLI BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fever, cough, dyspnea.  Abnormal chest examination (rales or decreased breath sounds).  Abnormal chest radiograph (infiltrates, hilar adenopa- thy, pleural effusion).  General Considerations Bacterial pneumonia is inflammation of the lung classified according to the infecting organism. Patients with the follow- ing problems are particularly predisposed to this disease: aspi- ration, immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, congenital anomalies (intrapulmonary sequestration, tracheoesophageal fistula, or cleft palate), abnormalities in clearance of mucus (CF, ciliary dysfunction, tracheomalacia, or bronchiectasis), congestive heart failure, and perinatal contamination.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The bacterial pathogen, severity of the disease, and age of the patient may cause substantial variations in the presentation of acute bacterial pneumonia. Infants may have few or nonspecific findings on history and physical examination. Immunocompetent older patients may not be extremely ill. Some patients may present with fever only or only with signs of generalized toxicity. Others may have additional symp- toms or signs of lower respiratory tract disease (respiratory distress, cough, and sputum production), pneumonia (rales, decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and abnor- mal tactile or vocal fremitus), or pleural involvement (splint- ing, pain, friction rub, and dullness to percussion). Some patients may have additional extrapulmonary findings, such as meningismus or abdominal pain, due to pneumonia itself. Others may have evidence of infection at other sites due to the same organism causing their pneumonia: meningitis, otitis media, sinusitis, pericarditis, epiglottitis, or abscesses. B. Laboratory Findings Elevated white blood cell counts (> 15,000/μL) frequently accompany bacterial pneumonia. However, a low white blood count (< 5000/μL) can be an ominous finding in this disease. C. Imaging Chest radiographic findings (lateral and frontal views) define bacterial pneumonia. Patchy infiltrates, atelectasis, hilar ade- nopathy, or pleural effusion may be observed. Radiographs should be taken in the lateral decubitus position to identify pleural fluid. Complete lobar consolidation is not a common finding in infants and children. Severity of disease may not correlate with radiographic findings. Clinical resolution pre- cedes resolution apparent on chest radiograph. D. Special Tests Invasive diagnostic procedures (bronchial brushing or wash- ing, lung puncture, or open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy) should be undertaken in critically ill patients when other means do not adequately identify the cause (see earlier section on Culture of Material from the Respiratory Tract).   CHAPTER 18 506 In patients producing sputum, stains and cultures may provide the diagnosis. Direct percutaneous aspiration of mate- rial for stains and cultures guided by fluoroscopy or ultrasonog- raphy should be considered in the severely compromised or ill.  Differential Diagnosis Loculated pyopneumothorax, an Echinococcus cyst, neo- plasms, plasma cell granuloma, and infected congenital cysts and sequestrations should be considered. Pneumatoceles, non–fluid-filled cysts, are common in children with empy- ema and usually resolve over time.  Complications Although complications due to abscesses are now rare, mediastinal shift, tension pneumothorax, and spontaneous rupture can occur. Diagnostic maneuvers such as lung punc- ture may also cause complications (pneumothorax).  Treatment Because of the risks of lung puncture, uncomplicated abscesses are frequently conservatively treated in the uncom- promised host with appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics directed at S aureus, H influenzae, and streptococci. Additional coverage for anaerobic and gram-negative organisms should be provided for others. Prolonged therapy (3 weeks or more) may be required. Attempts to drain abscesses via bronchos- copy have caused life-threatening airway compromise. Surgi- cal drainage or lobectomy is occasionally required, primarily in immunocompromised patients. However, such procedures may themselves cause life-threatening complications.  Prognosis Although radiographic resolution may be very slow, resolu- tion occurs in most patients without risk factors for lower respiratory tract infections or loss of pulmonary function. In the immunocompromised host, the outlook depends on the underlying disorder. Chan PC et al: Clinical management and outcome of childhood lung abscess: A 16-year experience.

528,Diseases of the Pulmonary Circulation,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,1869,"DISEASES OF THE PULMONARY CIRCULATION PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE  General Considerations Pulmonary hemorrhage is caused by a spectrum of disorders affecting the large and small airways and alveoli. It can occur as an acute or chronic process. Hemorrhage involving the alveoli is termed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. If pulmonary hemorrhage is subacute or chronic, hemosiderin-laden mac- rophages are found in the sputum and tracheal or gastric aspirate. Many cases are secondary to infection (bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic, viral, or fungal), lung abscess, bron- chiectasis (CF or other causes), foreign body, coagulopathy (often with overwhelming sepsis), or elevated pulmonary venous pressure (secondary to congestive heart failure or anatomic heart lesions). Other causes include lung contu- sion from trauma, arteriovenous fistula, multiple telangiec- tasias, pulmonary sequestration, agenesis of a single pulmo- nary artery, and esophageal duplication or bronchogenic cyst. Rarer causes are tumors (eg, bronchial adenoma or left atrial myxoma) and pulmonary infarction secondary to pulmonary embolus. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may be idiopathic or drug- related or may occur in Goodpasture syndrome, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and systemic vasculitides (often associated with such collagen-vascular diseases as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Wege- ner granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and Behçet’s disease). Idiopathic pulmonary hemo- siderosis refers to the accumulation of hemosiderin in the lung, especially the alveolar macrophage, as a result of chronic or recurrent hemorrhage (usually from pulmonary capillaries) that is not associated with the previously listed causes. Children and young adults are mainly affected, with the age at onset ranging from 6 months to 20 years. This group of disorders includes milk allergy in young infants (Heiner syndrome). Several cases of pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary hemosiderosis have been reported in infants exposed to a toxigenic mold, Stachybotrys chartarum, and other fungi. This association was initially noted in Cleveland, Ohio. The infants were primarily African American, living in older homes, and often the homes had recent water dam- age. Environmental tobacco smoke was also frequently present in the environment. Other forms of hypersensitiv- ity pneumonitis have also been reported to cause pulmo- nary bleeding.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Pulmonary hemorrhage has as many symptoms as it has causes. Large airway hemorrhage presents with hemoptysis and symptoms of the underlying cause, such as infection, foreign body, or bronchiectasis in CF. Hemoptysis from larger airways is often bright red or contains clots. Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis usually presents with nonspecific respiratory symptoms (cough, tachypnea, and retractions) with or without hemoptysis, poor growth, and fatigue. Some children or young adults may present with massive hemopty- sis, marked respiratory distress, stridor, or a pneumonia-like syndrome. Fever, abdominal pain, digital clubbing, and chest pain may be reported. Jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly may be present with chronic bleeding. Physical examination often reveals decreased breath sounds, rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.   RESPIRATORY TRACT & MEDIASTINUM 509 edema secondary to changes in permeability due to injury to the alveolocapillary barrier. In these settings, pulmonary edema occurs independently of the elevations of pulmonary venous pressure.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Cyanosis, tachypnea, tachycardia, and respiratory distress are commonly present. Physical findings include rales, diminished breath sounds, and (in young infants) expiratory wheezing. More severe disease is characterized by progres- sive respiratory distress with marked retractions, dyspnea, and severe hypoxemia. B. Imaging Chest radiographic findings depend on the cause of the edema. Pulmonary vessels are prominent, often with diffuse interstitial or alveolar infiltrates. Heart size is usually normal in permeability edema but enlarged in hydrostatic edema.  Treatment Although specific therapy depends on the underlying cause, supplemental oxygen therapy is indicated and, if needed, ventilator support for respiratory failure. Diuretics, digoxin, and vasodilators may be indicated for congestive heart failure along with restriction of salt and water. Recom- mended interventions for permeability edema are reduction of vascular volume and maintenance of the lowest central venous or pulmonary arterial wedge pressure possible with- out sacrificing cardiac output or causing hypotension (see following discussion). β-Adrenergic agonists such as terbu- taline have been shown to increase alveolar clearance of lung water, perhaps through the action of a sodium-potassium channel pump. Maintaining normal albumin levels and a hematocrit concentration above 30 maintains the filtration of lung liquid toward the capillaries, avoiding low oncotic pressure.

CONGENITAL PULMONARY  LYMPHANGIECTASIA  General Considerations Structurally, congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia appears as dilated subpleural and interlobular lymphatic channels and may present as part of a generalized lymphangiectasis (in association with obstructive cardiovascular lesions— especially total anomalous pulmonary venous return) or as an isolated idiopathic lesion. Pathologically, the lung appears firm, bulky, and noncompressible, with prominent cystic lymphatics visible beneath the pleura. On cut section, dilated lymphatics are present near the hilum, along interlobular septa, around bronchovascular bundles, and beneath the pleura. Histologically, dilated lymphatics have a thin endo- thelial cell lining overlying a delicate network of elastin and collagen.  Clinical Findings Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia is a rare, usually fatal disease that generally presents as acute or persistent respiratory distress at birth. Although most patients do not survive the newborn period, some survive longer, and there are isolated case reports of its diagnosis later in childhood. It may be associated with features of Noonan syndrome, asple- nia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, septal defects, atrioventricular canal, hypoplastic left heart, aortic arch malformations, and renal malformations. Chylothorax has been reported. Chest radiographic findings include a ground-glass appearance, prominent interstitial markings suggesting lymphatic distention, diffuse hyperlucency of the pulmonary parenchyma, and hyperinflation with depression of the diaphragm.  Prognosis Although the onset of symptoms may be delayed for as long as the first few months of life, prolonged survival is extremely rare. Most deaths occur within weeks after birth. Rapid diagnosis is essential in order to expedite the option of pulmonary transplantation.

531,Disorders of the Chest Wall,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,4189,"DISORDERS OF THE CHEST WALL EVENTRATION OF THE DIAPHRAGM Eventration of the diaphragm occurs when striated muscle is replaced with connective tissue and is demonstrated on radiograph by elevation of part or all of the diaphragm. There are two types: congenital and acquired. The congenital type is thought to represent incomplete formation of the diaphragm in utero. The acquired type is related to atrophy of diaphragm muscles secondary to prenatal or postnatal phrenic nerve injury. The differential diagnosis of eventra- tion includes phrenic nerve injury and partial diaphragmatic hernia. Small eventrations may be an incidental finding on a chest radiograph, commonly seen on the right side. Ultra- sound provides useful information to further define a sus- pected eventration. When defects are small, there is no   RESPIRATORY TRACT & MEDIASTINUM 513 alveolar spaces into the interstitial spaces of the lung. Migra- tion to the visceral pleura ultimately leads to rupture into the pleural space. Associated conditions include pneumomedi- astinum, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema. These conditions are more com- monly associated with dissection of air into the interstitial spaces of the lung with retrograde dissection along the bronchovascular bundles toward the hilum.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The clinical spectrum can vary from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress. Associated symptoms include cyanosis, chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical examination may reveal decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion on the affected side with tracheal deviation to the opposite side. When pneumothorax is under tension, cardiac function may be compromised, resulting in hypotension or narrowing of the pulse pressure. Pneumopericardium is a life-threaten- ing condition that presents with muffled heart tones and shock. Pneumomediastinum rarely causes symptoms by itself. B. Imaging Chest radiographs usually demonstrate the presence of free air in the pleural space. If the pneumothorax is large and under tension, compressive atelectasis of the underlying lung and shift of the mediastinum to the opposite side may be demonstrated. Cross-table lateral and lateral decubitus radio- graphs can aid in the diagnosis of free air. Pneumopericar- dium is identified by the presence of air completely surround- ing the heart, whereas in patients with pneumomediastinum, the heart and mediastinal structures may be outlined with air, but the air does not involve the diaphragmatic cardiac border. Chest CT scan may be helpful with recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces to look for subtle pulmonary disease not seen on chest radiograph, but this is debated.  Differential Diagnosis Acute deterioration of a patient on a ventilator can be caused by tension pneumothorax, obstruction or dislodgment of the endotracheal tube, or ventilator failure. Radiographically, pneumothorax must be distinguished from diaphragmatic her- nia, lung cysts, congenital lobar emphysema, and cystic ade- nomatoid malformation, but this task is usually not difficult.  Treatment Small or asymptomatic pneumothoraces usually do not require treatment and can be managed with close observa- tion. Larger or symptomatic ones usually require drainage, although inhalation of 100% oxygen to wash out blood nitrogen can be tried. Needle aspiration should be used to relieve tension acutely, followed by chest tube or pigtail catheter placement. Pneumopericardium requires immediate identification, and if clinically symptomatic, needle aspiration to prevent death, followed by pericardial tube placement. In older patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, recur- rences are common; sclerosing and surgical procedures are often required.

535,Sleep-Disordered Breathing,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,3394,"SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING  General Considerations Sleep apnea is recognized as a major public health problem in adults, with the risk of excessive daytime sleepiness, driving accidents, poor work performance, and effects on mental health. Pediatric sleep disorders are less commonly recog- nized because of a lack of training in sleep problem recogni- tion and the presentation, risks, and outcome all differ from those in adults. The spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing includes obstructive sleep apnea, upper airway resistance disorder, and primary snoring. Sleep apnea is defined as cessation of breathing and can be classified as obstructive (the attempt to breathe through an obstructed airway) or central (the lack of effort to breathe). Snoring, mouth breathing, and upper airway obstruction are further discussed in Chapter 17.  Clinical Findings & Differential Diagnosis A. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Obstructive sleep apnea occurs in normal children with an incidence of about 2%, increasing in children with craniofa- cial abnormalities, neuropathies, or other medical problems. The incidence also increases when children are medicated with hypnotics, sedatives, or anticonvulsants. While not all children who snore have sleep apnea, there is recent literature that raises concerns that snoring without apnea has neurobe- havioral consequences. (See Chapter 17.) Obstructive sleep apnea should be suspected whenever a child presents with nightly snoring, witnessed apnea, labored breathing, frequent nighttime arousals, failure to thrive, oxygen desaturations, life-threatening events, behavior abnormalities, obesity, or craniofacial abnormalities. Upper airway resistance syn- drome is characterized by the presence of daytime fatigue or sleepiness in the presence of a normal polysomnogram and oxygen saturations. Symptoms are similar to obstructive sleep apnea, including change in appetite, poor performance in school, and problems with behavior.   CHAPTER 18 514 B. Central Sleep Apnea Central apneas are common in infants and children. They are considered significant if longer than 20 seconds or associated with bradycardia or desaturations. Clinical significance is uncertain, but may be relevant if they occur frequently or gas exchange problems exist. Healthy children have been shown to have central apneas lasting 25 seconds without clear conse- quences. In comparison, central hypoventilation syndrome patients have intact voluntary control of ventilation, but lack automatic control. During sleep, they will hypoventilate to the point at which they need ventilatory support that may require treatment with positive airway pressure and a rated tidal volume via tracheostomy. Central sleep apnea may be present with this syndrome, but is not usually noted. C. Diagnostic Studies When sleep apnea is suspected, the polysomnogram is the diagnostic test of choice. This test measures sleep state with electroencephalogram leads and electromyography, airflow at the nose, heart rate and rhythm, gas exchange (CO2 and oxygenation), and leg movements, along with other poten- tial data including esophageal pH, end-tidal CO2, body position, muscle activity, and other optional additions. Poly- somnography allows diagnosis of various forms of apnea, sleep fragmentation, periodic limb movement disorder, or other sleep disorders of children. Overnight oximetry is not an ideal study to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea. While it may identify subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea, its sensitivity is low. Literature has shown normal oximetry studies in half a population of subjects with polysomno- gram-confirmed obstructive sleep apnea.  Treatment First-line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea in children is adenotonsillectomy, which improves the clinical status for most children with normal craniofacial structure. Even chil- dren with craniofacial anomalies or neuromuscular disor- ders may benefit, although additional treatment with contin- uous positive airway pressure may be indicated. Down syndrome presents unique challenges: Up to half of these children can still have obstructive sleep apnea despite ade- notonsillectomy. Treatment of young or developmentally delayed children with apnea also presents several challenges. (See Chapter 17 for additional discussion.) Because the differential diagnosis of sleepiness is quite varied among children, pediatric sleep disorder centers are the referral of choice for testing and initiation of therapy.

536,Apparent Life-Threatening Events in Infancy,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,3316,"APPARENT LIFE-THREATENING  EVENTS IN INFANCY  General Considerations Apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs) are characterized as being frightening to the observer and commonly include some combination of apnea, color change (usually cyanosis or pal- lor), a marked change in muscle tone (usually extreme limp- ness), choking, or gagging. The observer sometimes fears the infant has died. The most frequent problems associated with an ALTE are gastrointestinal (~50%), neurologic (30%), respira- tory (20%), cardiovascular (5%), metabolic and endocrine (< 5%), or diverse other problems, including child abuse. Up to 50% of ALTEs remain unexplained and are referred to as apnea of infancy. The relationship between ALTE and future risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is not clear. The term apparent life-threatening event replaced “near-miss SIDS” in order to distance the event from a direct association with SIDS. Literature has reported an increased risk when extreme cardio- pulmonary events were present at the time of the ALTE. Fewer than 10% of SIDS victims have had a prior history of ALTE. The mechanism for ALTEs is unknown, but because they do not occur after infancy, immaturity is felt to play a major role. Indeed, classic studies on the nervous system, reflexes, and responses to apnea or hypoxia during sleep show pro- found cardiovascular compromise in infants during stimula- tion of the immature autonomic nervous system; adults would not be affected. The following section describes an approach to the patient who has undergone an ALTE, taking note of the very broad differential diagnosis and uncertainties in both evalu- ation and treatment.  Clinical Findings & Differential Diagnosis A. History and Physical Examination Table 18–4 classifies disorders associated with ALTEs. A careful history is often the most helpful part of the evalua- tion. It is useful to determine whether the infant has been chronically ill or essentially well. A history of several days of poor feeding, temperature instability, or respiratory or gas- trointestinal symptoms suggests an infectious process. Reports of “struggling to breathe” or “trying to breathe” imply airway obstruction. Association of the episodes with feeding implies discoordinated swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux, or airway obstruction. Episodes that typically follow crying may be related to breath-holding. Association of   519 19 Cardiovascular Diseases Henry M. Sondheimer, MD Jeffrey R. Darst, MD Elizabeth M. Shaffer, MD Shelley D. Miyamoto, MD Eight in 1000 infants are born with a congenital heart defect. Acquired heart diseases such as Kawasaki disease, myocardi- tis, and rheumatic heart disease also cause significant mor- bidity and mortality in children. Advances in medical and surgical care now allow more than 90% of children with congenital heart defects to enter adulthood. It is therefore important that current pediatric cardiac care include not only the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease but also the prevention of risk factors for adult cardiovascu- lar disease—obesity, smoking and hyperlipidemia. Subspe- cialty clinics addressing the needs of adults with repaired or palliated congenital heart disease are needed to assess and advise patients regarding such adult issues as the impact of pregnancy, the risks of anticoagulation during pregnancy, and appropriate adult career choices. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION The presence of a heart murmur suggests the possibility of heart disease. Murmurs, however, may be functional or innocent, and not all serious cardiovascular disorders are accompanied by an easily detectable murmur. HISTORY Most congenital defects lead either to decreased pulmonary blood flow or increased pulmonary blood flow with pulmo- nary congestion. Symptoms vary according to the alteration in pulmonary blood flow (Table 19–1). The presence of other cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations and chest pain should also be determined by history in the older child, paying particular attention to the timing (at rest or activity-related), onset, and termination (gradual versus sud- den), and precipitating and relieving factors. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION General The examination should begin with a visual assessment of skin perfusion and skin color. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure (in all four extremities), and oxygen satura- tion are required. Many congenital cardiac defects occur as part of a genetic syndrome (Table 19–2) and the complete assessment includes an evaluation for dysmorphic features that may be clues to the associated cardiac defect.

A precordial bulge indicates cardiomegaly. Palpation may reveal increased precordial activity, right ventricular lift, or left-sided heave; a diffuse point of maximal impulse; or a precordial thrill caused by a grade IV/VI murmur. The thrill of aortic stenosis is found in the suprasternal notch. In patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, a palpable pulmonary closure (P2) is frequently noted at the upper left sternal border. B. Auscultation 1. Heart sounds—The first heart sound (S1) is the sound of atrioventricular (AV) valve closure. It is best heard at the lower left sternal border and is usually medium-pitched. Although S1 has multiple components only one of these (M1) is usually audible. The second heart sound (S2) is the sound of semilunar valve closure. It is best heard at the upper left sternal border. S2 has two component sounds, A2 and P2 (aortic and pul- monic valve closure). Splitting of S2 varies with respiration, widening with inspiration and narrowing with expiration. Abnormal splitting of S2 may be an indication of cardiac disease (Table 19–3). The third heart sound (S3) is the sound of rapid left ventric- ular filling. It occurs in early diastole, after S2, and is medium- to low-pitched. In healthy children, S3 diminishes or disappears when going from supine to sitting or standing. A persistent S3 is often heard in the presence of a dilated left ventricle (LV) caused by cardiomyopathy or a large left-to-right shunt. The fourth heart sound (S4) is associated with atrial contraction and increased atrial pressure and has a low pitch similar to that of S3. It occurs just prior to S1 and is not normally audible. It is heard in the presence of atrial contraction into a noncompliant ventricle as in hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy or hypertrophied LV from other causes. Ejection clicks are usually related to dilated great vessels or valve abnormalities. They can be heard throughout ven- tricular systole and are classified as early, mid, or late. Early ejection clicks at the mid left sternal border are from the pulmonic valve. Aortic clicks are typically best heard at the apex. In contrast to aortic clicks, pulmonic clicks vary with respiration, becoming louder during inspiration. A mid to late ejection click at the apex is most typically caused by mitral valve prolapse. 2. Murmurs—A heart murmur is the most common cardio- vascular finding leading to a cardiology referral. Innocent or functional heart murmurs are common, and 40–45% of children have an innocent murmur at some time during childhood. a. Characteristics—All murmurs should be described based on the following characteristics: (1) Location and radiation—Where the murmur is best heard and where the sound extends. (2) Relationship to cardiac cycle and duration—Systolic ejection (immediately following S1 with a crescendo/decre- scendo change in intensity), pansystolic (occurring through- Table 19–1.

The timing of the murmur provides valuable clues as to underlying pathology (Table 19–4). (3) Intensity—Grade I describes a soft murmur heard with difficulty; grade II, soft but easily heard; grade III, loud but without a thrill; grade IV, loud and associated with a precordial thrill; grade V, loud, with thrill, and audible with the edge of the stethoscope; grade VI, very loud and audible with the stethoscope off the chest. (4) Quality—Harsh, musical, or rough; high, medium, or low in pitch. (5) Variation with position—Audible when the patient is supine, sitting, standing, or squatting. b. Innocent murmurs—The six most common innocent murmurs of childhood are: (1) Newborn murmur—Heard in the first few days of life, this murmur is at the lower left sternal border, without significant radiation. It has a soft, short, vibratory grade I–II/ VI quality that often subsides when mild pressure is applied to the abdomen. It usually disappears by age 2–3 weeks. (2) Peripheral arterial pulmonary stenosis—This mur- mur, often heard in newborns, is caused by the normal branching of the pulmonary artery. It is heard with equal intensity at the upper left sternal border, at the back, and in both axillae. It is a soft, short, high-pitched, grade I–II/VI systolic ejection murmur and usually disappears by age 2. This murmur must be differentiated from true peripheral pulmonary stenosis (Williams syndrome, Alagille syndrome, or rubella syndrome), coarctation of the thoracic aorta, and valvular pulmonary stenosis. (3) Still murmur—This is the most common innocent murmur of early childhood. It is typically heard between 2 and 7 years of age. It is loudest midway between the apex and the lower left sternal border. Still murmur is a musical or vibratory, short, high-pitched, grade I–III early systolic mur- mur. It is loudest when the patient is supine. It diminishes or disappears with inspiration or when the patient is sitting. The Still murmur is louder in patients with fever, anemia, or sinus tachycardia from any reason. (4) Pulmonary ejection murmur—This is the most com- mon innocent murmur in older children and adults. It is heard from age 3 years onward. It is usually a soft systolic ejection murmur, grade I–II in intensity at the upper left sternal border. The murmur is louder when the patient is supine or when cardiac output is increased. The pulmonary ejection murmur must be differentiated from murmurs of pulmonary stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, atrial septal defect (ASD), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. (5) Venous hum—A venous hum is usually heard after age 2 years. It is located in the infraclavicular area on the right. It is a continuous musical hum of grade I–III intensity and may be accentuated in diastole and with inspiration. It is best heard in the sitting position. Turning the child’s neck, placing the child supine, and compressing the jugular vein obliterates the venous hum. Venous hum is caused by turbu- lence at the confluence of the subclavian and jugular veins. (6) Innominate or carotid bruit—This murmur is more common in the older child and adolescent. It is heard in the right supraclavicular area. It is a long systolic ejection mur- mur, somewhat harsh and of grade II–III intensity. The bruit can be accentuated by light pressure on the carotid artery and must be differentiated from all types of aortic stenosis. When functional murmurs are found in a child, the physician should assure the parents that these are normal heart sounds of the developing child and that they do not represent heart disease. Extracardiac Examination A. Arterial Pulse Rate and Rhythm Cardiac rate and rhythm vary greatly during infancy and childhood, so multiple determinations should be made. This is particularly important for infants (Table 19–5) whose heart rate varies with activity. The rhythm may be regular or there may be a phasic variation with respiration (sinus arrhythmia), which is normal. B. Arterial Pulse Quality and Amplitude The pulses of the upper and lower extremities should be compared. A bounding pulse is characteristic of run-off lesions, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), aortic regurgitation, arteriovenous malformation, or any condition Table 19–4. Pathologic murmurs. Systolic Ejection Pansystolic Diastolic Continuous Semilunar valve stenosis (AS/PS/truncal stenosis) VSD Semilunar valve regurgitation Runoff lesions ASD AVVR (MR/TR) (AI/PI/truncal insufficiency) (PDA/AVM/aortopulmonary collaterals) Coarctation AV valve stenosis (MS/TS) AI/PI, aortic insufficiency/pulmonic insufficiency; AS/PS, aortic stenosis/pulmonic stenosis; ASD, atrial septal defect; AV, atrioventricular; MS/TS, mitral  stenosis/tricuspid stenosis; AVVR, atrioventricular valve regurgitation; MR/TR, mitral regurgitation/tricuspid regurgitation; PDA/AVM, patent ductus arteriosus/ arteriovenous malformation; VSD, ventricular septal defect.  CHAPTER 19 522 with a low diastolic pressure (fever, anemia, or septic shock). Narrow or thready pulses occur in patients with conditions reducing cardiac output such as cardiomyopathy, myocardi- tis, pericardial tamponade, or severe aortic stenosis. A reduc- tion in pulse amplitude or blood pressure (> 10 mm Hg) with inspiration is referred to as pulsus paradoxus and is a telltale sign of pericardial tamponade. The femoral pulse should be palpable and equal in amplitude and simultaneous with the brachial pulse. A femoral pulse that is absent or weak, or that is delayed in comparison with the brachial pulse, suggests coarctation of the aorta. C. Arterial Blood Pressure Blood pressures should be obtained in the upper and lower extremities. Systolic pressure in the lower extremities should be greater than or equal to that in the upper extremities. The cuff must cover the same relative area of the arm and leg. Measurements should be repeated several times. D. Cyanosis of the Extremities Cyanosis results from an increased concentration (> 4–5 g/ dL) of reduced hemoglobin in the blood. Bluish skin color is usually, but not always, a sign. Visible cyanosis accompanies low cardiac output, hypothermia, and systemic venous con- gestion, even in the presence of adequate oxygenation. Cya- nosis should be judged only by the color of the mucous membranes (lips). Bluish discoloration around the mouth (acrocyanosis) is a feature of skin that has not been exposed to sun, and it does not correlate with cyanosis. E. Clubbing of the Fingers and Toes Clubbing is often associated with severe cyanotic congenital heart disease. It usually appears after age 1 year. Hypoxemia with cyanosis is the most common cause, but clubbing also occurs in patients with endocarditis, chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic pulmonary disease, and lung abscess. Digital clubbing may be a benign genetic variant. F. Edema Edema of dependent areas (lower extremities in the older child and the face and sacrum in the younger child) is characteristic of elevated right heart pressure, which may be seen with tricuspid valve pathology or right ventricle (RV) dysfunction (right heart failure) from a variety of causes including LV dysfunction. G. Abdomen Hepatomegaly is the cardinal sign of right heart failure in the infant and child. Hepatomegaly may also be seen in the child with pulmonary edema from lesions causing left-to-right shunting or left heart failure. Splenomegaly may be present in patients with long-standing heart failure (HF), and is characteristic of infective endocarditis. Ascites is also a fea- ture of chronic right heart failure. Examination of the abdo- men may reveal shifting dullness or a fluid wave. Finley JP et al: Assessing children’s heart sounds at a distance with digital recordings.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY The electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential in the evaluation of the cardiovascular system. The heart rate should first be determined, then the cardiac rhythm (Is the patient in a normal sinus rhythm or other rhythm as evidenced by a P wave with a consistent PR interval before every QRS com- plex?), and then the axis (Are the P and QRS axes normal for patient age?). Once this initial assessment of rate, rhythm, and axis is performed, attention can be directed toward assessment of chamber enlargement and finally to assess- ment of cardiac intervals and ST segments. Age-Related Variations The ECG evolves with age. The rate decreases and intervals increase with age. RV dominance in the newborn changes to LV dominance in the older infant, child, and adult. The normal ECG of the 1-week-old infant is abnormal for a 1-year-old child, and the ECG of a 5-year-old child is abnormal for an adult. Electrocardiographic Interpretation Figure 19–1 defines the events recorded by the ECG. A. Rate The heart rate varies markedly with age, activity, and state of emotional and physical well-being. In most infants and Table 19–5. Resting heart rates. Age Low High < 1 mo 80 160 1–3 mo 80 200 2–24 mo 70 120 2–10 y 60 90 11–18 y 40 90  CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES 523 younger children, the heart rate ranges from 70–200 beats per minute depending on the above. B. Rhythm Sinus rhythm should always be present in normal children. In contrast to adults, premature atrial and ventricular con- tractions are uncommon during childhood. C. Axis 1. P wave axis—The P wave is generated from atrial con- traction beginning in the high right atrium at the site of the sinus node. The impulse proceeds leftward and inferiorly, thus leading to a positive deflection in all left-sided and inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). The P wave in patients in normal sinus rhythm should be negative in lead aVR. 2. QRS axis—The net voltage should be positive in leads I and aVF in children with a normal axis. In the young child, RV dominance may persist, leading to a negative deflection in lead I. Several congenital cardiac lesions are associated with alterations in the normal QRS axis (Table 19–6). D. P Wave In the pediatric patient, the amplitude of the P wave is normally no greater than 3 mm and the duration no more than 0.08 second. The P wave is best seen in leads II and V1. E. PR Interval The PR is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. It increases with age and with slower rates. The PR interval ranges from a minimum of 0.10 second in infants to a maximum of 0.18 second in older children with slow rates. The PR interval is commonly prolonged in patients who have rheumatic heart disease and by digitalis. F. QRS Complex This represents ventricular depolarization, and its amplitude and direction of force (axis) reveal the relative size of the ▲ Figure 19–1.

Abnormal ventricular conduction (ie, right or left bundle- branch block) is also revealed. G. QT Interval This interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The QT duration may be prolonged as a primary condition or secondarily due to drugs or electrolyte imbalances (Table 19–7). The normal QT duration is rate-related and must be corrected using the Bazett formula: The normal QTc is less than or equal to 0.44 second. H. ST Segment This segment, lying between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the T wave, is affected by drugs, electrolyte imbalances, or myocardial injury. I. T Wave The T wave represents myocardial repolarization and is altered by electrolytes, myocardial hypertrophy, and ischemia. J. Impression The ultimate impression of the ECG is derived from a systematic analysis of the features described earlier as com- pared with expected normal values for the child’s age.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH Evaluation of the chest radiograph for cardiac disease should focus on (1) position of the heart, (2) position of the abdominal viscera, (3) cardiac size, (4) cardiac configura- tion, and (5) character of the pulmonary vasculature. Cardiac position is either levocardia (heart predomi- nantly in the left chest), dextrocardia (heart predominantly in the right chest), or mesocardia (midline heart). The position of the liver and stomach bubble is either in the normal position (abdominal situs solitus), inverted with the stomach bubble on the right (abdominal situs inversus), or variable with midline liver (abdominal situs ambiguous). The heart appears relatively large in normal newborns and decreases on the chest radiograph with age. The heart size should be less than 50% of the chest diameter in children older than age 1 year. The cardiac configuration on chest radiograph may provide useful diagnostic information, as certain cardiac lesions have a characteristic radiographic appearance (Tables 19–8 and 19–9). The pulmonary vascu- lature should be assessed. The presence of increased or decreased pulmonary blood flow provides a clue to cardiac diagnosis, particularly in the cyanotic infant (Table 19–10). The standard posteroanterior and left lateral chest radio- graphs are used (Figure 19–2). Table 19–7.

In Freedom RM (editor): Neonatal Heart Disease. Springer-Verlag, 1992. Dextrocardia Dextrocardia is a radiographic term used when the heart is on the right side of the chest. When dextrocardia occurs with reversal of position of the other important organs of the chest and abdomen (eg, liver, lungs, and spleen), the condi- tion is called situs inversus totalis, and the heart is usually normal. When dextrocardia occurs with the other organs normally located (situs solitus), the heart usually has severe defects. Rarely, the abdominal organs and lungs are in situs ambiguous. The liver is central and anterior in the upper abdomen, with the stomach pushed posteriorly. Bilateral right-sidedness (asplenia syndrome) or bilateral left-sided- ness (polysplenia syndrome) may occur, but in virtually all cases of situs ambiguous, congenital heart disease is present. ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY Echocardiography is a fundamental tool of pediatric cardiol- ogy. Using multiple ultrasound modalities (two-dimensional imaging, Doppler, and M-mode), cardiac anatomy, blood flow, intracardiac pressures, and ventricular function can be assessed. Echocardiography is based on the physical princi- ples of sound waves. The ultrasound frequencies utilized in cardiac imaging range from 2–10 million cycles/s. M-mode echocardiography uses short bursts of ultra- sound sent from a transducer. At acoustic interfaces, sound waves are reflected back to the transducer. The time it takes for the sound wave to return to the transducer is measured and the distance to the interface is calculated. That calculated distance is displayed against time, and a one-dimensional image is constructed that demonstrates cardiac motion. Two-dimensional imaging extends this technique by send- ing a rapid series of ultrasound bursts across a 90-degree sector, which allows construction of a two-dimensional image of the heart. Doppler ultrasound measures blood flow. The ultrasound transducer sends out a known fre- quency of sound which reflects off moving red blood cells. The transducer receives the reflected frequency and com- pares it with the transmitted frequency. The blood flow velocity can be calculated from the measured frequency shift. This information is used to estimate pressure gradients by the simplified Bernouli equation, in which the pressure gradient is equal to four times the calculated velocity (Pres- sure gradient = 4(V2)). A transthoracic echocardiogram is obtained by placing the transducer on areas of the chest where there is minimal lung interference. At each transducer position, the beam is swept through the heart and a three-dimensional image of the heart is constructed in the interpreter’s mind. Complex intracardiac anatomy and spatial relationships can be described, making possible the accurate diagnosis of simple and complex congenital heart disease. In addition to struc- tural details, Doppler gives information about intracardiac blood flow and pressure gradients. Commonly used Doppler techniques include color flow imaging, pulsed wave, and continuous wave Doppler. Color flow imaging gives general information on the direction and velocity of flow. Pulsed and continuous wave Doppler imaging give more precise mea- surements of blood velocity. The role of M-mode in the ultrasound examination has decreased as other ultrasound modalities have been developed. M-mode is still used to measure LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions and Table 19–10. Alterations in pulmonary  blood flow in cyanotic cardiac lesions.

A typical transthoracic echocardiogram performed by a skilled sonographer takes about 30 minutes, and patients must be still for the examination. Frequently infants and children cannot cooperate for the examination and sedation may be required. Although echocardiography is an excellent tool for car- diac examination, there are drawbacks to the technique. Two-dimensional imaging can accurately diagnose intracar- diac anatomy, but extracardiac structures such as pulmonary arteries and the aortic arch are more difficult to assess. Doppler imaging measures pressure gradients accurately but does not obtain exactly the same information obtained by cardiac catheterization. The indications for pediatric echo- cardiography are summarized in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) prac- tice guidelines published in 2003. Snider AR et al: Echocardiography in Congenital Heart Disease. Mosby, 1997. NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY Nuclear imaging is a useful adjunct to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in assessing both fixed and reversible areas of myocardial ischemia. It is valuable in evaluating myocardial perfusion in patients with Kawasaki disease, repaired anom- alous left coronary artery or other coronary anomalies, myocardial bridging in the setting of hypertrophic cardio- myopathy, or chest pain in association with ECG changes with exercise. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is valuable for evaluation and noninvasive follow-up of many congenital heart defects. It is particularly useful in imaging the thoracic vessels, which are difficult to image by transthoracic echocardiogram. Cardiac gated imaging allows dynamic evaluation of structure and blood flow of the heart and great vessels. It is invaluable to diagnose and follow aortic coarctation, to follow the progress of aortic dilation in Marfan syndrome, to quantify regurgitant lesions such as pulmonary insufficiency after repair of tetral- ogy of Fallot, and to measure ventricular function in patients with inadequate echocardiographic images. Because it allows computer manipulation of the images of heart and great vessels, three-dimensional MRI is an ideal noninvasive way of obtaining accurate reconstructions of the heart. If a cardiac MRI is performed in a child younger than age 8 years, general anesthesia is often required. Boxt LM, Rozenshtein A: MR imaging of congenital heart disease. Magn Reson Imaging Clin North Am 2003;11:27 [PMID: 12797509]. CARDIOPULMONARY STRESS TESTING Most children with heart disease are capable of normal activity. Data on cardiac function after exercise are essential to prevent- ing unnecessary restriction of activities. The response to exercise is helpful in determining the need for and the timing of cardio- vascular surgery as well as a useful objective outcome measure of the results of medical and surgical interventions. Bicycle ergometers or treadmills can be used in children as young as age 5 years. The addition of a metabolic cart enables one to assess whether exercise impairment is secondary to cardiac limitation, pulmonary limitation, deconditioning, or lack of effort. Exercise variables include the ECG, blood pressure response to exercise, oxygen saturation, ventilation, maximal oxygen consumption, and peak work load attained. Cardiopulmonary stress testing is routine in children with congenital cardiac lesions to ascertain limitations, develop exercise prescriptions, assess the effect of therapies, and decide on the need for cardiac transplantation. Stress testing is also employed in children with structurally normal hearts to rule out cardiac or pulmonary pathology in children with symp- toms during exertion. Significant stress ischemia or dysrhyth- mias warrant physical restrictions or appropriate therapy. Children with poor performance due to suboptimal condi- tioning benefit from a planned exercise program.

ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES Quantitating the partial oxygen pressure (PO2) or O2 saturation (eg, by pulse oximetry) during the administra- tion of 100% oxygen is the most useful method of distin- guishing cyanosis produced primarily by heart disease or by lung disease in sick infants. In cyanotic heart disease, the partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) increases very little when 100% oxygen is administered over the values obtained while breathing room air. However, PaO2 usually increases very significantly when oxygen is administered to a patient who has lung disease. Table 19–11 illustrates the Table 19–11. Examples of responses to 10 minutes  of 100% oxygen in lung disease and heart disease.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION  & ANGIOCARDIOGRAPHY Cardiac catheterization precisely defines the anatomic and physiologic abnormalities in simple and complex cardiac mal- formations. Cardiac catheterization may be performed for diagnostic purposes when further anatomic or physiologic data are needed prior to a therapeutic decision or may be performed for therapeutic purposes when the cardiac condition can be palliated or treated in the catheterization laboratory. Therapeutic Cardiac Catheterization Therapeutic procedures performed during cardiac catheter- ization include coil embolization of a PDA, balloon angio- plasty with or without stent placement for aortic coarctation or branch pulmonary artery stenoses, balloon atrial sep- tostomy, valvuloplasty of stenotic aortic or pulmonic valves, and placement of ASD and ventricular septal defect (VSD) devices. Cardiac catheterization is also performed to evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical therapy. An example of this use of catheterization is monitoring changes in pulmonary vas- cular resistance during the administration of nitric oxide or prostacyclin in a child with primary pulmonary hyperten- sion. Electrophysiologic evaluation and ablation of abnormal electrical pathways in children can be performed by qualified personnel in the pediatric catheterization laboratory. The risks of cardiac catheterization (morbidity and mor- tality) must be explained to the patient’s family. Although the risks are very low for elective studies in older children (< 0.1%), the risk of major complications in distressed infants is about 2%. Interventional procedures such as bal- loon valvuloplasty increase these risks further. Cardiac Catheterization Data Figure 19–3 shows oxygen saturation (in percent) and pres- sure (in millimeters of mercury) values obtained at cardiac catheterization from the chambers and great arteries of the heart. These values are within the normal range for a child. A. Oxygen Content and Saturation;  Pulmonary (Qp) and Systemic (Qs)  Blood Flow (Cardiac Output) In most laboratories, left-to-right shunting is determined by changes of blood oxygen content or saturation during sam- pling through the right side of the heart. A significant increase in oxygen saturation between one right chamber and the other indicates the presence of a left-to-right shunt at the site of the increase. The oxygen saturation of the peripheral arterial blood should always be determined dur- ing cardiac catheterization. Normal arterial oxygen satura- tion is 95–97% at sea level and 92–94% at 5280 feet. Subnor- mal saturations suggest the presence of a right-to-left shunt, underventilation, or pulmonary disease. The size of a left-to-right shunt is usually expressed as a ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) or as liters per minute as determined by the Fick principle: B. Pressures Pressures should be determined in all chambers and major vessels entered. It is not normal for systolic pressure in the ventricles to exceed systolic pressure in the great arteries, or mean diastolic pressure in the atria to exceed end-diastolic pressure in the ventricles. If a gradient in pressure exists, an obstruction is present, and the severity of the gradient is one criterion for the necessity of operative repair or catheter intervention. An RV systolic pressure of 100 mm Hg and a ▲ Figure 19–3.

550,Perinatal & Neonatal Circulation,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,1629,"PERINATAL & NEONATAL CIRCULATION At birth, two events occur that affect the cardiovascular and pulmonary system (1) the umbilical cord is clamped, remov- ing the placenta from the maternal circulation; and (2) breath- ing commences. As a result, marked changes in the circulation occur. During fetal life, the placenta offers low resistance to blood flow. In contrast, the pulmonary arteri- oles are markedly constricted and offer high resistance to the flow of blood into the lungs. Pulmonary blood flow accounts for only 7–10% of the combined in utero ventricular output. At birth, pulmonary blood flow dramatically increases with the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure. The causes of prolonged high pulmonary vascular resistance include physical factors (lack of an adequate air-liquid inter- face or ventilation), low oxygen tension, and vasoactive mediators such as elevated endothelin peptide levels or leukotrienes. Clamping the cord produces an immediate increase in resistance to flow in the systemic circuit. As breathing commences, the PO2 of the small pulmonary arterioles increases, causing their constriction to decrease and producing a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. Increased oxygen tension, rhythmic lung distention, and production of nitric oxide as well as prostacyclin play major roles in the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance at birth. The pulmonary vascular resistance falls below that of the sys- temic circuit, resulting in a reversal in direction of blood flow across the ductus arteriosus. Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus begins shortly after birth. The ductus arteriosus usually remains patent for 3–5 days. During the first hour after birth, a small right-to- left shunt is present (as in the fetus). However, after 1 hour, bidirectional shunting occurs, with the left-to-right direction predominating. In most cases, right-to-left shunting disap- pears completely by 8 hours. In patients with severe hypoxia (eg, in the syndrome of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn), pulmonary vascular resistance remains high, resulting in a continued right-to-left shunt. Increased PO2 of the arterial blood causes spasm of the ductus. Although flow through the ductus arteriosus usually is gone by 5 days of life, the vessel does not close anatomically for 7– 14 days. In fetal life, the foramen ovale serves as a one-way valve shunting blood from the inferior vena cava through the right atrium into the left atrium. At birth, because of the changes in the pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and the increase in the quantity of blood returning from the pulmo- nary veins to the left atrium, the left atrial pressure rises above that of the right atrium. This functionally closes the flap of the foramen ovale, preventing flow of blood across the septum. The foramen ovale remains probe patent in 10– 15% of adults. Persistent pulmonary hypertension is a clinical syndrome of full-term infants. The neonate develops tachypnea, cyano- sis, and pulmonary hypertension during the first 8 hours after delivery. These infants have massive right-to-left ductal or foramen shunting (or both) for 3–7 days because of high pulmonary vascular resistance. Progressive hypoxia and aci- dosis will cause early death unless the pulmonary resistance can be lowered. Postmortem findings include increased thickness of the pulmonary arteriolar media. Increase alveo- lar PO2 with hyperventilation, alkalosis, paralysis, surfactant administration, high-frequency ventilation, and cardiac pressors can usually reverse the resistance. Inhaled nitric oxide selectively dilates pulmonary vasculature, produces a sustained improvement in oxygenation, and has reduced the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In the normal newborn, pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure continue to fall during the first weeks of life as a result of demuscularization of the pulmonary arterioles. Adult levels of pulmonary resistance and pressure are normally achieved by 4–6 weeks of age. It is Resistance Pressure Flow --------------------- =    CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES 529 at this time typically that signs of pulmonary overcirculation associated with left-to-right shunts (VSD or atrioventricular septal defect [AVSD]) appear.

551,Heart Failure,Oral Medicine & Dentistry ,362,"HEART FAILURE Heart failure (HF) is the clinical condition in which the heart fails to meet the circulatory and metabolic needs of the body. The term congestive heart failure is falling out of favor, as some patients with significant cardiac dysfunction have symptoms of exercise intolerance and fatigue without evidence of conges- tion. Almost all infants who develop HF from congenital heart lesions do so by 6 months of age. Common causes of HF in infants include VSD, PDA, coarctation of the aorta, AV septal defect, large arteriovenous malformations, and chronic atrial tachyarrhythmias. Metabolic, mitochondrial, and neuromus- cular disorders with associated cardiomyopathy present at various ages depending on the diagnosis. HF due to acquired conditions such as myocarditis occur at any age. Children with HF may present with irritability, diaphoresis with feeds, fatigue, exercise intolerance, or evidence of pulmonary con- gestion (see Table 19–1). Treatment of Heart Failure The therapy of HF should be directed toward the underlying cause as well as the symptoms. Regardless of the cause, neurohormonal activation occurs early when ventricular systolic dysfunction is present. Plasma catecholamine levels (eg, norepinephrine) increase and cause tachycardia, dia- phoresis, and, by activating the renin-angiotensin system, peripheral vasoconstriction and salt and water retention. There is no gold standard diagnostic or therapeutic approach to HF in children. Treatment must be individualized and therapies should be aimed at improving cardiac performance by targeting the three determinants of cardiac performance: (1) preload, (2) afterload, and (3) contractility. Inpatient Management of Heart Failure Patients with cardiac decompensation may require hospital- ization for initiation or augmentation of HF therapy. Table 19–12 demonstrates intravenous inotropic agents used to augment cardiac output and their relative effect on heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac index. The drug used will depend in part on the cause of the HF. A. Intravenous Inotropic Support 1. Afterload reduction a. Milrinone—This selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate, thereby improving the inotropic state of the heart. In addition to a dose-dependent increase in cardiac contractility, milrinone is a systemic and pulmonary vasodilator and thus an effective agent in both right and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Milrinone reduces the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome following open heart surgery. The usual dosage range is 0.25–0.75 mcg/kg/min. b. Nitroglycerin—Nitroglycerin functions primarily as a dilator of venous capacitance vessels and causes a reduction of right and left atrial pressure. Systemic blood pressure may also fall, and reflex tachycardia may occur. Nitroglycerin is used to improve coronary blood flow and may be especially useful when cardiac output is reduced because of coronary underperfusion following congenital heart surgery. The usual intravenous dosage range is 1–3 mcg/kg/min. 2. Enhancement of contractility a. Dopamine—This naturally occurring catecholamine increases myocardial contractility primarily via cardiac β- adrenergic activation. Dopamine also directly acts on renal dopamine receptors to improve renal perfusion. The usual dose range for HF is 3–10 mcg/kg/min.  Table 19–12. Intravenous inotropic agents.

Digitalis poisoning—This acute emergency must be treated without delay. Digoxin poisoning most commonly occurs in toddlers who have taken their parents’ or grand- parents’ medications. The child’s stomach should be emp- tied immediately by gastric lavage even if several hours have passed since ingestion. Patients who have ingested massive amounts of digoxin should receive large doses of activated charcoal. In advanced heart block, atropine or temporary ventricular pacing may be needed. Digoxin immune Fab can be used to reverse potentially life-threatening intoxication. Antiarrhythmic agents may be useful. 5. Fluid restriction—Fluid restriction is rarely used in pedi- atric cardiology due to the effectiveness of diuretics. Ensur- ing adequate caloric intake to promote growth is a more important goal in children with HF.

The most common genetic abnormality is a microdeletion in the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11) associated with DiGeorge syndrome. These children often have conotruncal abnormalities such as truncus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, or double-outlet RV. Intrauterine factors such as maternal diabetes, alcohol consump- tion, progesterone use, viral infection, and other maternal terato- gen exposure are associated with an increased incidence of cardiac malformations.

Atrial Septal Defect  (Ostium Secundum Variant) ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fixed, widely split S2, RV heave.  Grade I–III/VI ejection systolic murmur at the pulmo- nary area.  Large shunts cause a diastolic flow murmur at the lower left sternal border.  ECG shows rsR′ in lead V1.  Frequently asymptomatic.  General Considerations Atrial septal defect (ASD) is an opening in the atrial septum permitting the shunting of blood between the atria. There are three major types: ostium secundum, ostium primum, and sinus venosus. Ostium secundum is the most common type. Ostium primum defect is associated with atrioventricular septal defect. The sinus venosus defect is frequently associated with abnormal pulmonary venous return, as the location of the sinus venosus is intimately related to the right upper pulmonary vein. Ostium secundum ASD occurs in 10% of patients with congenital heart disease and is two times more common in females than males. The defect is most often sporadic but may be familial. Pulmonary hypertension and growth failure are uncommon complications in infancy and childhood. After the third decade, atrial arrhythmias or pulmonary vascular disease may develop. In the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, left- to-right shunting decreases, and right-to-left shunting becomes the major clinical abnormality (Eisenmenger syndrome).  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Most infants and children with ASD have no cardiovascular symptoms. With age, some never develop symptoms. Others develop easy fatigability as older children or adults, or rarely, HF. The direction of flow across the ASD is determined by the compliance of the underlying ventricle. Therefore, cyanosis does not occur unless RV dysfunction occurs, usually as a result of pulmonary hypertension that causes reversal of the shunt across the defect. Peripheral pulses are normal and equal. The heart is usually hyperactive, with an RV heave felt best at the mid to lower left sternal border. S2 at the pulmonary area is widely split and often fixed. The pulmonary component is normal Table 19–13. Digoxin dosing schedule.

567,Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease,"Ear, Nose, & Throat ",615,"CYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE TETRALOGY OF FALLOT ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Hypoxemic spells during infancy.  Right-sided aortic arch in 25% of patients.  Systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border.  General Considerations In tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), a single embryologic abnormal- ity causes multiple morphologic problems. Anterior devia- tion of the infundibular (pulmonary outflow) septum causes narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract. This devia- tion also causes a VSD and the aorta overrides the crest of the ventricular septum. The RV hypertrophies, not because of pulmonary stenosis, but because it is pumping against sys- temic resistance across a (usually) large VSD. ToF is the most common cyanotic cardiac lesion and accounts for 10% of all congenital heart disease. A right-sided aortic arch is present in 25% of cases, and ASD occurs in 15%. Obstruction to RV outflow with a large VSD causes a right- to-left shunt at the ventricular level with arterial desaturation. The greater the obstruction and the lower the systemic vascu- lar resistance, the greater is the right-to-left shunt. ToF is associated with deletions in the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11) in as many as 15% of affected children.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Clinical findings vary with the degree of RV outflow obstruc- tion. Patients with mild obstruction are minimally cyanotic or acyanotic. Those with maximal obstruction are deeply cyanotic from birth. Few children are asymptomatic. Most have cyanosis by age 4 months, and the cyanosis usually is progressive, as subvalvular obstruction increases. Growth and development are not typically delayed, but easy fatigabil- ity and dyspnea on exertion are common. The fingers and toes show variable clubbing depending on age and severity of cyanosis. Historically, older children with ToF would fre- quently squat to increase systemic vascular resistance. This decreased the amount of right-to-left shunt, forcing blood through the pulmonary circuit, and would help ward off cyanotic spells. Squatting is rarely seen as the diagnosis is now made much earlier. Hypoxemic spells, also called cyanotic or “Tet spells,” are one of the hallmarks of severe ToF. They are characterized by (1) sudden onset of cyanosis or deepening of cyanosis; (2) dyspnea; (3) alterations in consciousness, from irritabil- ity to syncope; and (4) decrease or disappearance of the systolic murmur (as RV outflow tract flow becomes com- pletely obstructed). These episodes most commonly start at age 4–6 months. Cyanotic spells are treated acutely by admin- istration of oxygen and placing the patient in the knee-chest position. Intravenous morphine should be administered cau- tiously. Propranolol produces β-blockade and may reduce the obstruction across the RV outflow tract. Acidosis, if present, should be corrected with intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Chronic oral prophylaxis of cyanotic spells with propranolol may be useful to delay surgery but the onset of Tet spells usually prompts expedient intervention. An RV lift is palpable. S2 is predominantly aortic and single. A grade II–IV/VI, rough, systolic ejection murmur is present at the left sternal border in the third intercostal space and radiates well to the back. B. Laboratory Findings Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count are usu- ally elevated secondary to arterial desaturation. C. Imaging Chest radiographs show a normal size heart. The RV is hypertrophied, often shown by an upturning of the apex (boot-shaped heart). The main pulmonary artery segment is usually concave and, if there is a right aortic arch, the aortic knob is to the right of the trachea. The pulmonary vascular markings are usually decreased. D. Electrocardiography The QRS axis is rightward, ranging from +90 to +180 degrees. The P waves are usually normal. RVH is always present, but RV strain patterns are rare. E. Echocardiography Two-dimensional imaging is diagnostic, revealing thicken- ing of the RV wall, overriding of the aorta, and a large subaortic VSD.

Similar to patients with ToF, they almost always outgrow the RV-to- pulmonary artery conduit placed in infancy and require revi- sion of the conduit in later childhood. The risk of early pulmonary vascular obstructive disease is high in the unre- paired patient and a decision to delay open-heart surgery beyond age 4–6 months is not wise even in stable patients.

576,Acquired Heart Disease,"Ear, Nose, & Throat ",764,"ACQUIRED HEART DISEASE RHEUMATIC FEVER Rheumatic fever remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries that suffer from poverty, overcrowding, and poor access to health care. Even in developed countries, rheumatic fever has not been entirely eradicated. The overall incidence in the United States is less than 1 per 100,000. There have been regional resurgences, such as in Utah in the 1980s, with an incidence of nearly 12 per 100,000 children between the ages of 3 and 17 years. Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the upper respiratory tract is the essential trigger in predisposed individuals. Only certain serotypes of group A Streptococcus cause rheumatic fever. The latest attempts to define host susceptibility implicate immune response genes that are present in approximately 15% of the population. The immune response triggered by colonization of the pharynx with group A streptococci consists of (1) sensitization of B lymphocytes by streptococcal antigens, (2) formation of antistreptococcal antibody, (3) formation of immune com- plexes that cross-react with cardiac sarcolemma antigens, and (4) myocardial and valvular inflammatory response. The peak age of risk in the United States is 5–15 years. The disease is slightly more common in girls and in African Americans. The annual death rate from rheumatic heart disease in school-aged children (whites and nonwhites) recorded in the 1980s was less than 1 per 100,000.  Clinical Findings Two major or one major and two minor manifestations (plus supporting evidence of streptococcal infection) based on the modified Jones criteria are needed for the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (Table 19–14). Except in cases of rheumatic fever manifesting solely as Sydenham chorea or long-standing carditis, there should be clear evidence of a streptococcal infection such as scarlet fever, a positive throat culture for group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus, and increased antistreptolysin O or other streptococcal antibody titers. The antistreptolysin O titer is significantly higher in rheumatic fever than in uncomplicated streptococcal infections. A. Carditis Carditis is the most serious consequence of rheumatic fever and varies from minimal to life-threatening HF. The term carditis implies pancardiac inflammation, but it may be limited to valves, myocardium, or pericardium. Valvulitis is frequently seen, with the mitral valve most commonly affected. Mitral insufficiency is the most common valvular residua of acute rheumatic carditis. Mitral stenosis after acute rheumatic fever is rarely encountered until 5–10 years after the first episode. Thus, mitral stenosis is much more commonly seen in adults than in children. An early decrescendo diastolic murmur consistent with aortic insufficiency is occasionally encountered as the sole valvular manifestation of rheumatic carditis. The aortic valve is the second most common valve affected in polyvalvular as well as in single-valve disease. The aortic valve is involved more often in males and in African Americans. Dominant aortic stenosis of rheumatic origin does not occur in pediat- ric patients. In one large study, the shortest length of time observed for a patient to develop dominant aortic stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease was 20 years. B. Polyarthritis The large joints (knees, hips, wrists, elbows, and shoulders) are most commonly involved and the arthritis is typically migratory.

A social history to reveal psychosocial stressors and cigarette smoke exposure may be revealing. On physical examination, attention must be placed on the vital signs; general appearance of the child; the chest wall musculature; cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal examination findings; and quality of peripheral pulses. If the pain can be repro- duced through direct palpation of the chest wall, it is almost always musculoskeletal in origin. Etiology Cardiac disease is a rare cause of chest pain, but if misdiag- nosed it may be life-threatening. Although myocardial infarction rarely occurs in healthy children, patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, anomalous left coronary artery, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be at increased risk for ischemia. It is also important to ask the family about a history of Kawasaki disease, as these children are at risk for myocardial infarction secondary to thrombosis of coronary aneurysms. More than 50% of children and adolescents who exhibit sequelae from Kawasaki disease arrive at the emer- gency department with chest pain. Young children may mistake palpitations for chest pain. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial flutter, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), or ventricular tachycardia may be associated with chest pain in children. Structural lesions that can cause chest pain include aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, and mitral valve prolapse. Structural cardiac lesions are usually accompanied by significant findings on cardiac examination. Of children with mitral valve pro- lapse, 30% will complain of chest pain presumably caused by papillary muscle ischemia. Other cardiac lesions causing chest pain include dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, pericardi- tis, rheumatic carditis, and aortic dissection. Noncardiac chest pain may be due to a respiratory illness, reactive airway disease, pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pul- monary embolism. Gastrointestinal causes of chest pain include reflux, esophagitis, and foreign body ingestion. The most common cause of chest pain (30% of children) is inflammation of musculoskeletal structures of the chest wall. Costochondritis is caused by inflammation of the costo- chondral joints and is usually unilateral. In most cases sophisticated testing is not required. How- ever, if a cardiac origin is suspected, a pediatric cardiologist should be consulted. Evaluation in these instances may include an ECG, chest radiograph, echocardiogram, Holter monitor, or serum troponin levels. Cava JR, Sayger PL: Chest pain in children and adolescents.

586,Cardiac Transplantation,"Ear, Nose, & Throat ",2705,"Cardiac Transplantation Cardiac transplantation has become an effective therapeutic modality for infants and children with end-stage cardiac disease. Indications for transplantation include (1) progres- sive HF despite maximal medical therapy, (2) complex congenital heart diseases that are not amenable to surgical repair or palliation or in instances in which the surgical palliative approach has an equal or higher risk of mortality compared with transplantation, and (3) malignant arrhyth- mias unresponsive to medical therapy, catheter ablation, or automatic implantable cardiodefibrillator. Approximately 300–400 pediatric cardiac transplant procedures are per- formed annually in the United States. Infant (< 1 year of age) transplants account for 30% of pediatric cardiac transplants. The current estimated half-life for children undergoing car- diac transplantation is approximately 13 years. This is a rapidly evolving field, and the most recent data indicate an optimistic future for the transplant recipient. Careful evaluation of the recipient and the donor is performed prior to cardiac transplantation. Assessment of the recipient’s pulmonary vascular resistance is critical, as irreversible and severe pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for post-transplant right heart failure and early death. End-organ function of the recipient may also influence post- transplant outcome and should be evaluated closely. Donor- related factors that can have an impact on outcome include cardiac function, amount of inotropic support needed, active infection (HIV and hepatitis B and C are contraindi- cations to donation), donor size, and ischemic time to transplantation. Immunosuppression The ideal post-transplant immunosuppressive regimen allows the immune system to continue to recognize and respond to foreign antigens in a productive manner while avoiding graft rejection. Although there are many different regimens, calcineurin inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine and tac- rolimus) are the mainstay of maintenance immunosup- pression in pediatric heart transplantation. Calcineurin inhibitors may be used in isolation. Double-drug therapy includes the addition of antimetabolite or antiproliferative medications such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or sirolimus. Due to the significant adverse side effects of corticosteroids in children, attempts have been made in some centers to discontinue triple-drug therapy that would include steroid use. Growth retardation, susceptibility to infection, impaired wound healing, hypertension, and a cushingoid appearance are some of the consequences of long-term steroid use. Graft Rejection Despite advances in immunosuppression, graft rejection remains the leading cause of death in the first 3 years after transplantation. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of rejec- tion are not entirely known. T cells are required for rejection, but multiple cell lines and mechanisms are likely involved. Because graft rejection can present in the absence of clinical   CHAPTER 19 566 Pietra BA: Transplantation immunology 2003: A simplified approach.

588,Primary Pulmonary Hypertension,"Ear, Nose, & Throat ",137,"PRIMARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Often subtle with symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope.  Loud pulmonary component of S2; ECG with RVH.  Implies exclusion of secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension.  Rare, progressive, and often fatal disease without treatment.  General Considerations Unexplained or primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in children is a rare disease with an estimated overall incidence of 1–2 persons per million worldwide. Pulmonary hyperten- sion is defined as a mean pulmonary pressure greater than 25 mm Hg at rest or greater than 30 mm Hg during exercise. PPH is a diagnosis made after exclusion of all other causes of pulmonary hypertension. Secondary pulmonary hyperten- sion is most commonly associated with congenital heart disease, pulmonary parenchymal disease, causes of chronic hypoxia (upper airway obstruction), thrombosis, liver dis- ease, hemoglobinopathies and collagen vascular disease. PPH is difficult to diagnose in the early stages because of its subtle manifestations. Most patients with PPH are young adult women, although the sex incidence is equal in children. As recently as 1991, the diagnosis of PPH in individuals younger than 16 years of age carried a medial survival of only 10 months. Fortunately, survival is improving with the advent of new therapies. Familial PPH occurs in 6–12% of affected individuals. When a clear familial association is known, the disease shows evidence of genetic anticipation, presenting at younger ages in subsequent generations.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The clinical picture varies with the severity of pulmonary hypertension, and usually early symptoms are subtle, delay- ing the diagnosis. Initial symptoms may be dyspnea, palpita- tions, or chest pain, often brought on by strenuous exercise or competitive sports. Syncope may be the first symptom, which usually implies severe disease. As the disease progresses, patients have signs of low cardiac output and right heart failure. Right heart failure may be manifested by increasing hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, and an S3 gallop on exami- nation. Murmurs of pulmonary regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be present, and the pulmonary component of S2 is usually pronounced. B. Imaging The chest radiograph most often reveals a prominent main pulmonary artery, and the RV may be enlarged. The periph- eral pulmonary vascular markings may be normal or dimin- ished. However, in 6% of patients with confirmed PPH, the chest radiograph is normal. C. Electrocardiography The ECG usually shows right ventricular hypertrophy with an upright T wave in V1 (from age 7 days to 7 years) or a qR complex in lead V1 or V3. Also present may be evidence of right axis deviation and right atrial enlargement. D. Echocardiography The echocardiogram is an essential tool for excluding other congenital heart diseases. It frequently shows RVH and dila- tion. In the absence of other structural disease, any tricuspid and pulmonary insufficiency jets can be used to estimate pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively. Other echocardiographic modalities such as myocardial per- formance index and input vascular impedance are in the early stages of use in evaluation of pulmonary hypertension. E. Cardiac Catheterization  and Angiocardiography Cardiac catheterization is the best method of diagnosing PPH. As an invasive test, it carries with it associated risks and should be performed with caution. The procedure is per- formed to rule out cardiac causes of pulmonary hyperten- sion, determine the severity of disease, and define treatment strategies. The reactivity of the pulmonary vascular bed to short-acting vasodilator agents (oxygen, nitric oxide, or prostacyclin) can be assessed and used to determine treat- ment options. Angiography may show a decrease in the number of small pulmonary arteries with tortuous vessels. F. Other Evaluation Modalities Cardiac MRI is used in some patients to measure heart function and blood flow. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing using cycle ergometry correlates with disease severity. More simply, a 6-minute walk test, in which distance walked and perceived level of exertion are measured, has a strong inde- pendent association with mortality in late disease.  Treatment The goal of therapy is to reduce pulmonary artery pressure and increase cardiac output.

599,Disorders of the Esophagus,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,83,"DISORDERS OF THE ESOPHAGUS GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Recurrent post-prandial spitting and vomiting in healthy infants that resolves spontaneously.  Heartburn and regurgitation in older children.  Chronic complications—esophagitis, stricture, anemia, and Barrett esophagus.  Diagnosis is clinical in infancy with upper gastrointesti- nal (GI) radiograph and upper endoscopy to rule out other GI disease.  Clinical Findings A. Infants with Reflux Gastroesophageal (GE) reflux is common in young infants. Frequent post-prandial regurgitation, ranging from effortless to forceful, is the most common infant symptom. Infant reflux is usually benign but in rare cases causes failure to thrive, food refusal, colic, rumination, and neck contortions (Sandifer syn- drome). Apneic spells in young infants, especially occurring with position change after feeding, may be caused by reflux. GE reflux is common in neurologically impaired infants. Reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus occurs during spontaneous relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter that are unaccompanied by swallowing. Low pressures in the lower esophageal sphincter or developmental immaturity of the sphincter are not causes of GE reflux in infants. Normal factors promoting reflux in infants are their small stomach capacity, frequent large-volume feedings, short esophageal length, supine positioning, and slow swallowing response to the flow of refluxed material up the esophagus. Infants’ indi- vidual responses to the stimulus of reflux, particularly the maturity of their self-settling skills, are important factors determining the severity of reflux-related symptoms. An important differential point in evaluating infants with GE reflux is whether the vomited material contains bile. Bile- stained emesis in an infant requires immediate evaluation as it may be a symptom of intestinal obstruction (malrotation with volvulus, intussusception). B. Older Children with Reflux GE reflux disease (GERD) is diagnosed clinically in older children when reflux causes persistent symptoms with or without inflammation of the esophagus. Older children with GERD have less frequent vomiting than infants, and more often complain of adult-type symptoms of regurgitation into the mouth, heartburn, and dysphagia. Esophagitis occurs in children with GERD and requires endoscopic evaluation. Children with asthma, cystic fibrosis, developmental handi- caps, hiatal hernia, and repaired tracheoesophageal fistula are at increased risk of GERD. C. Diagnostic Studies In thriving infants, GE reflux is a clinical diagnosis. An upper GI series rules out anatomic causes of vomiting but is not an accurate test for GE reflux because of a 30% false-positive rate. In older children with heartburn, a trial of acid-suppressing medication may be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Persistent symptoms should be investigated by upper GI radiographs and endoscopy to rule out other organic causes. pH probe or esophageal impedance studies may be helpful in recognizing an association between episodic or unusual symptoms and reflux events. pH studies quantify the number and duration of acid reflux events. Esophageal intraluminal impedance moni- toring is a pH-independent method of detecting fluid move- ments in the esophagus. These studies have shown that epi- sodes of nonacid reflux occur as frequently as acid reflux  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Repeated esophageal dilations may be necessary as a stricture develops but are not per- formed acutely. When radiographs show erosion into the mediastinum or peritoneum, antibiotics are mandatory. Intraluminal esophageal stenting may be beneficial during early management. Surgical replacement of the esophagus by colonic interposition or gastric tube may be needed for long strictures resistant to dilation. Although agents such as bleach, detergents, and acids may cause esophageal irritation, it is rare for any but the strongest acids and detergents to produce full-thickness necrosis and stricture.

FOREIGN BODIES IN THE ALIMENTARY TRACT The most common foreign bodies ingested by children are coins. Most foreign bodies pass through the GI tract without difficulty, although objects longer than 5 cm may be unable to pass the ligament of Treitz. Ingested foreign bodies tend to lodge in areas of natural constriction—valleculae, thoracic inlet, GE junction, pylorus, ligament of Treitz, and ileocecal junction. Foreign bodies lodged in the esophagus for more than 24 hours, or those causing pain or respiratory distress, should be removed. Disk-shaped batteries lodged in the esophagus should be removed immediately. Smooth foreign bodies in the stomach, such as buttons or coins, may be monitored without attempting removal for up to several months if the child is free of symptoms. Disk- shaped batteries in the stomach will generally pass unevent- fully. Straight pins, screws, and nails generally pass without incident. Large, open safety pins should be removed from the stomach because they may not pass the pyloric sphincter and may cause perforation. Wooden toothpicks should be removed. They have usually been chewed prior to accidental swallowing and carry mouth flora which may cause abscess formation if the toothpick becomes imbedded in the bowel wall. The use of balanced electrolyte lavage solutions con- taining polyethylene glycol may help the passage of small, smooth foreign bodies lodged in the stomach or intestine. Lavage is especially useful in hastening the passage of disk- shaped batteries or ingested tablets that may be toxic. Failure of a smooth foreign body to exit the stomach after several days suggests the possibility of gastric outlet obstruction. Most foreign bodies can be removed from the esophagus or stomach by a skilled endoscopist. Under fluoroscopy, a Foley catheter with balloon inflated below the foreign body can be used to extract smooth, round esophageal foreign bodies if the foreign body has been present for less than a few days and if the child has not had previous esophageal surgery. Only an experienced radiologist should attempt this maneuver. TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA See Chapter 1. "
602,Disorders of the Stomach & Duodenum,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,2997,"DISORDERS OF THE  STOMACH & DUODENUM HIATAL HERNIA In paraesophageal hiatal hernias, the esophagus and GE junction are in their normal anatomic position, but the gastric cardia is herniated through the diaphragmatic hiatus along side the GE junction. In sliding hiatal hernias, the GE junction and a portion of the proximal stomach are dis- placed above the diaphragmatic hiatus. Paraesophageal her- nias are rare in childhood; patients present with pain, esoph- ageal obstruction, or respiratory compromise. The most common cause of paraesophageal hernia is previous fun- doplication surgery. Sliding hiatal hernias are common. GE reflux may accompany sliding hiatal hernias, although most produce no symptoms. Surgery is indicated if paraesopha- geal or sliding hiatal hernias produce persistent symptoms. PYLORIC STENOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Postnatal muscular hypertrophy of the pylorus.  Progressive gastric outlet obstruction, nonbilious vom- iting, dehydration, and alkalosis in infants younger than 12 weeks.  Upper GI contrast radiographs or abdominal ultrasound are diagnostic. The cause of postnatal pyloric muscular hypertrophy with gastric outlet obstruction is unknown. The incidence is 1–8 per 1000 births, with a 4:1 male predominance. A positive family history is present in 13% of patients. Recent studies suggest that erythromycin in the neonatal period is associ- ated with a higher incidence of pyloric stenosis in infants younger than 30 days.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Vomiting usually begins between 2 and 4 weeks of age but may start as late as 12 weeks. Vomiting rapidly becomes projectile after every feeding. Vomiting starts at birth in about 10% of cases. Onset of symptoms may be delayed in preterm infants. The vomitus is rarely bilious but may be blood-streaked. Infants are usually hungry and nurse avidly.

Treatment consists of duodenoduodenostomy or duodenojejunos- tomy without operative dissection or division of the pan- creatic annulus. "
605,Disorders of the Small Intestine,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,490,"DISORDERS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE INTESTINAL ATRESIA & STENOSIS Excluding anal anomalies, intestinal atresia or stenosis accounts for one third of all cases of neonatal intestinal obstruction (see Chapter 1). Antenatal ultrasound can identify intestinal atresia in utero; polyhydramnios occurs in most affected pregnancies. Prematurity and other con- genital anomalies may be present. The localization and relative incidence of atresias and stenoses are listed in Table 20–1. Bile-stained vomiting and abdominal distention begin in the first 48 hours of life. Multiple sites in the intestine may be affected. The overall length of the small intestine may be significantly shortened. Radiographic features include dilated loops of small bowel and absence of colonic gas. Barium enema reveals narrow-caliber micro- colon because of lack of intestinal flow distal to the atresia. In over 10% of patients with intestinal atresia the mesentery is absent, and the superior mesenteric artery cannot be identified beyond the origin of the right colic and ileocolic arteries. The ileum coils around one of these two arteries, giving rise to the so-called Christmas tree deformity on contrast radiographs. The tenuous blood supply often compromises surgical anastomoses. The dif- ferential diagnosis of intestinal atresia includes Hirsch- sprung disease, paralytic ileus secondary to sepsis, midgut volvulus, and meconium ileus. Surgery is mandatory. Postoperative complications include short bowel syn- drome and small bowel hypomotility secondary to ante- natal obstruction. INTESTINAL MALROTATION  General Considerations The midgut extends from the duodenojejunal junction to the mid transverse colon. It is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, which runs in the root of the mesentery. During gestation, the midgut elongates into the umbilical sac, return- ing to an intra-abdominal position during the 10th week of gestation. The root of the mesentery rotates in a counterclock- wise direction during retraction causing the colon to cross the abdominal cavity ventrally. The cecum moves from the left to the right lower quadrant, and the duodenum crosses dorsally becoming partly retroperitoneal. When rotation is incom- plete, the dorsal fixation of the mesentery is defective and shortened, so that the bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the mid transverse colon may rotate around its narrow mesenteric root and occlude the superior mesenteric artery (volvulus).  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Malrotation with volvulus accounts for 10% of neonatal intestinal obstructions. Most infants present in the first 3 weeks of life with bile-stained vomiting or with overt small bowel obstruction. Intrauterine volvulus may cause intesti- nal obstruction or perforation at birth. The neonate may present with ascites or meconium peritonitis. Later present- ing signs include intermittent intestinal obstruction, malab- sorption, protein-losing enteropathy, or diarrhea. Associated congenital anomalies, especially cardiac, occur in over 25% of symptomatic patients. B. Imaging An upper GI series shows the duodenojejunal junction and the jejunum on the right side of the spine. The diagnosis of malrotation can be further confirmed by barium enema, which may demonstrate a mobile cecum located in the midline, right upper quadrant, or left abdomen.  Treatment & Prognosis Surgical treatment of malrotation is the Ladd procedure. In young infants the Ladd procedure should be performed even Table 20–1. Localization and relative frequency of congenital gastrointestinal atresias and stenoses. Area Involved Type of Lesion Relative Frequency Pylorus   Atresia; web or diaphragm 1% Duodenum 80% are distal to the ampulla of Vater Atresia, stenosis; web or diaphragm 45% Jejunoileal Proximal jejunum and distal ileum Atresia (multiple in 6–29%); stenosis 50% Colon Left colon and rectum Atresia (usually associated with atresias of the small bowel) 5–9%    GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 587 is reserved for patients with gangrenous or perforated appendix. A single intraoperative dose of cefoxitin or cefote- tan is recommended for all patients to prevent postoperative infection. The mortality rate is less than 1% during child- hood, despite the high incidence of perforation. In uncom- plicated nonruptured appendicitis, a laparoscopic approach is associated with a shortened hospital stay. Bundy DG et al: Does this child have appendicitis? JAMA 2007;298:438 [PMID: 17652298]. DUPLICATIONS OF THE  GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Duplications are congenital spherical or tubular structures found most commonly in the ileum. The other common locations of duplication are the duodenum, rectum, and esophagus. Duplications usually contain fluid and some- times blood if necrosis has taken place. Most duplications are attached to the mesenteric side of the gut. They generally do not communicate with the intestinal lumen but share a common muscular coat. The epithelial lining of the duplica- tion is usually of the same type as the bowel from which it originates. Some duplications (neuroenteric cysts) are attached to the spinal cord and are associated with hemiver- tebrae and anterior or posterior spina bifida. Symptoms of vomiting, abdominal distention, colicky pain, rectal bleeding, partial or total intestinal obstruction, or an abdominal mass may start in infancy. Diarrhea and malabsorption may result from bacterial overgrowth in com- municating duplications. Physical examination may reveal a rounded, smooth, movable mass, and barium radiograph or CT of the abdomen may show a noncalcified cystic mass displacing other organs. 99mTc-pertechnetate scan may help identify duplications containing gastric mucosa. Duplica- tions of the ileum can give rise to an intussusception. Prompt surgical treatment is indicated. "
609,Disorders of the Colon,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,1860,"DISORDERS OF THE COLON CONGENITAL AGANGLIONIC MEGACOLON (HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE)  General Considerations Hirschsprung disease results from an absence of ganglion cells in the mucosal and muscular layers of the colon. Neural crest cells fail to migrate into the mesodermal layers of the gut during gestation, possibly secondary to abnormal end- organ cell surface receptors or local deficiency of nitric oxide synthesis. The absence of ganglion cells results in failure of the colonic muscles to relax in front of an advancing bolus. The rectum (30%) or rectosigmoid (44%) is usually affected. The entire colon may be aganglionic (8%). Segmental agan- glionosis is rare and is probably an acquired ischemic lesion. The aganglionic segment has normal or slightly narrowed caliber with dilation of the normal colon proximal to the obstructing aganglionic segment. The mucosa of the dilated colonic segment may become thin and inflamed, causing diarrhea, bleeding, and protein loss (enterocolitis). A familial pattern has been described, particularly in total colonic aganglionosis. The disease is four times more com- mon in boys than girls, and 10–15% of patients have Down syndrome. Mutations in the ret proto-oncogene have been identified in about 15% of cases.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Failure of the newborn to pass meconium, followed by vomiting, abdominal distention, and reluctance to feed, suggest the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. Enterocolitis manifested by fever, explosive diarrhea, and prostration, is reported in approximately 50% of affected newborns. Enterocolitis may lead to inflammatory and ischemic changes in the colon, with perforation and sepsis. In some patients, especially those with short segments involved, symptoms are not obvious at birth. In later infancy, alternat- ing obstipation and diarrhea predominate. The older child is more likely to have constipation alone. The stools are foul- smelling and ribbon-like. The abdomen is distended with prominent veins. Peristaltic waves are visible and fecal masses palpable. Intermittent bouts of intestinal obstruction, hypochromic anemia, hypoproteinemia, and failure to thrive are common. Encopresis is rare. On digital rectal examination, the anal canal and rectum are devoid of fecal material despite obvious retained stool on abdominal examination or radiographs. If the aganglionic segment is short, there may be a gush of flatus and stool as the finger is withdrawn. Infants of diabetic mothers may have similar symptoms and, in this setting, small left colon syndrome should be suspected. Meglumine diatrizoate (Gastrografin) enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic in small left colon syndrome as it reveals a meconium plug in the left colon, which is often passed during the diagnostic radiograph. The left colon is narrow but usually functional. In a small proportion of patients with small left colon, Hirschsprung disease may later be found. B. Laboratory Findings Ganglion cells are absent in both the submucosal and mus- cular layers of involved bowel. Special stains may show nerve trunk hypertrophy and increased acetylcholinesterase activ- ity. Ganglionated bowel above the aganglionic segment is sometimes found to contain more than normal numbers of ganglion cells in abnormal locations (neuronal dysplasia). This finding is sometimes associated with persistent motor dysfunction of the remnant colon.    GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 591 use is the most common antecedent of pseudomembranous colitis, previous GI surgery and antimetabolite therapy in cancer patients are also associated with its development. C difficile secretes enterotoxins that cause necrotizing inflammation of the colon mucosa. The patient characteristi- cally has fever, abdominal distention, tenesmus, diarrhea, and generalized abdominal tenderness. Chronic presentations with low-grade fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain have been described. Diarrheal stools contain sheets of neutrophils and sometimes gross blood. Plain abdominal radiographs show a thickened colon wall and ileus. On colonoscopy, the colon is covered by small, raised white plaques (pseudomembranes) with areas of apparently normal bowel in between. Biopsy specimens show “exploding crypts”—an eruption of white cells that appears to be shooting out of affected crypts. Stool cultures often show overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus, which is probably an opportunistic organism growing in the necrotic tissue. C difficile can be cultured in specialized labora- tories. Identification of stool toxins is the usual method of diagnosis. Infants up to 18–24 months of age may have toxins in the stool but do not develop disease or require therapy. Infants do not have sufficient receptors for the toxins to produce disease. The treatment of pseudomembranous colitis consists of stopping antibiotics and instituting therapy with oral vanco- mycin (30–50 mg/kg/d) or metronidazole (30 mg/kg/d). Vancomycin is many times more expensive than metronida- zole and no more efficacious. Metronidazole can be given intravenously in patients with vomiting or ileus. Relapse occurs after treatment in 10–50% of patients because of exsporulation of residual spores in the colon. Retreatment with the same antibiotic regimen is usually effective, but multiple relapses are possible and may be a significant management problem. Ulcerative colitis may be an underly- ing problem in cases of apparent recurrent C difficile. "
613,Disorders of the Peritoneal Cavity,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,2039,"DISORDERS OF THE PERITONEAL CAVITY PERITONITIS Primary bacterial peritonitis accounts for less than 2% of childhood peritonitis. The most common causative organ- isms are Escherichia coli, other enteric organisms, hemolytic streptococci, and pneumococci. Primary peritonitis occurs in patients with splenectomy, splenic dysfunction, or asci- tes (nephrotic syndrome, advanced liver disease, kwash- iorkor). It also occurs in infants with pyelonephritis or pneumonia. Secondary peritonitis is much more common. It is associated with peritoneal dialysis, penetrating abdominal trauma, or ruptured viscus. The organisms associated with secondary peritonitis vary with the cause. Organisms not commonly pathogenic such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida may cause secondary peritonitis in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. Multiple enteric organisms may be isolated after penetrating abdominal injury, bowel perfo- ration, or ruptured appendicitis. Intra-abdominal abscesses may form in pelvic, subhepatic, or subphrenic areas, but discrete localization of infection is less common in young infants than in adults. Symptoms of peritonitis include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, acidosis, and shock. Respirations are shal- low. The abdomen is tender, rigid, and distended, with involuntary guarding. Bowel sounds may be absent. Diar- rhea is fairly common in primary peritonitis and less so in secondary peritonitis. Most peritonitis is an acute medical emergency. In patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, perito- nitis can be a chronic infection causing milder symptoms. Leukocyte count is high initially (> 20,000/μL) with a predominance of immature forms, and later may fall to neutropenic levels, especially in primary peritonitis. Plain abdominal radiographs and CT scan will confirm the pres- ence of ascites. Bacterial peritonitis should be suspected if paracentesis fluid contains more than 500 leukocytes/μL or more than 32 mg/dL of lactate; if it has a pH less than 7.34; or if the pH is over 0.1 pH unit less than arterial blood pH. Diagnosis is made by Gram stain and culture, preferably of 5–10 mL of fluid for optimal yield. The blood culture is often positive in primary peritonitis. Antibiotic treatment and supportive therapy for dehydra- tion, shock, and acidosis are indicated. Surgical treatment of the underlying cause of secondary peritonitis is critical. Removal of infected peritoneal dialysis catheters in patients with secondary peritonitis is sometimes necessary and almost always required if Candida infection is present. CHYLOUS ASCITES Neonatal chylous ascites may be due to congenital infection or developmental abnormality of the lymphatic system (intestinal lymphangiectasia). If the thoracic duct is in- volved, chylothorax may be present. Later in life, chylous ascites may result from congenital lymphangiectasia, retro- peritoneal or lymphatic tumors, peritoneal bands, abdomi- nal trauma, or infection, or it may occur after cardiac or abdominal surgery. It may be associated with intestinal malrotation.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Both congenital and acquired lymphatic obstruction cause chylous ascites, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. The abdomen is distended, with a fluid wave and shifting dullness. Unilat- eral or generalized peripheral edema may be present. B. Laboratory Findings Laboratory findings include hypoalbuminemia, hypogam- maglobulinemia, and lymphopenia. Ascitic fluid contains    CHAPTER 20 592 lymphocytes and has the biochemical composition of chyle if the patient has just been fed; otherwise, it is indistinguishable from ascites secondary to cirrhosis.  Differential Diagnosis Chylous ascites must be differentiated from ascites due to liver disease and in the older child, from constrictive peri- carditis, chronic elevated right heart pressure, malignancy, infection, or inflammatory diseases causing lymphatic obstruction. In the newborn, urinary ascites from anatomic abnormalities of the kidney or collecting system must be considered. A simple test to diagnose urinary ascites is urea nitrogen or creatinine concentration of abdominal fluid. Neither of these is present in chylous or hepatic ascites  Complications & Sequelae Chylous ascites caused by intestinal lymphatic obstruction is associated with fat malabsorption and protein loss. Intestinal loss of albumin and γ-globulin may lead to edema and increase the risk of infection. Rapidly accumulating chylous ascites may cause respiratory complications. The primary infections and malignancies causing chylous ascites may be life-threatening.  Treatment & Prognosis Little can be done to correct congenital abnormalities due to hypoplasia, aplasia, or ectasia of the lymphatics unless they are surgically resectable. Treatment is supportive, consisting mainly of a very high-protein diet and careful attention to infections. Shunting of peritoneal fluid into the venous system is sometimes effective. A fat-free diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides decreases the formation of chylous ascites. Total parenteral nutrition may rarely be necessary. Infusions of albumin generally provide only tem- porary relief and are rarely used for chronic management. In the neonate, congenital chylous ascites may spontaneously disappear following one or more paracenteses and a medium-chain triglyceride diet.

GASTROINTESTINAL  TUMORS & MALIGNANCIES JUVENILE POLYPS Juvenile polyps are usually pedunculated and solitary. The head of the polyp is composed of hyperplastic glandular and vascular elements, often with cystic transformation. Juvenile polyps are benign, and 80% occur in the rectosigmoid. Their incidence is highest between ages 3 and 5 years, and they are rare before age 1 year and usually autoamputate by age 15 years. They are more frequent in boys. The painless passage of small amounts of bright red blood on a normal or constipated stool is the most frequent manifestation. Abdominal pain is rare, but a juvenile polyp can be the lead point for an intussusception. Low-lying polyps may prolapse during defecation. Rarely, many juvenile polyps may be present in the colon, causing anemia, diarrhea, and protein loss. A few cases of generalized juvenile polyposis involving the stomach, small bowel, and colon have been reported. These cases are associ- ated with a slightly increased risk of cancer. Colonoscopy is diagnostic and therapeutic when polyps are suspected. After removal of the polyp by electrocautery, nothing further should be done if histologic findings con- firm the diagnosis. There is a slight risk of developing further juvenile polyps. Other polyposis syndromes are summarized in Table 20–4. CANCERS OF THE ESOPHAGUS,  SMALL BOWEL, & COLON Esophageal cancer is rare in childhood. Cysts, leiomyomas, and hamartomas predominate. Caustic injury of the esopha- gus increases the very long-term risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Chronic peptic esophagitis is associated with Barrett esophagus, a precancerous lesion. Simple GE reflux in infancy without esophagitis is not a risk for cancer of the esophagus. The most common gastric or small bowel cancer in children is lymphoma or lymphosarcoma. Intermittent abdominal pain, abdominal mass, intussusception, or a celiac-like picture may be present. Carcinoid tumors are usually benign and most often an incidental finding in the appendix. Metastasis is rare. The carcinoid syndrome (flush- ing, sweating, hypertension, diarrhea, and vomiting), associ- ated with serotonin secretion, only occurs with metastatic carcinoid tumors. Adenocarcinoma of the colon is rare in childhood. The transverse colon and rectosigmoid are the two most com- monly affected sites. The low 5-year survival rate relates to the nonspecificity of presenting complaints and the large percentage of undifferentiated types. Children with a family history of colon cancer, chronic ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis syndromes are at greater risk. MESENTERIC CYSTS These rare tumors may be small or large, single or multiloc- ulated. They are thin-walled and contain serous, chylous, or hemorrhagic fluid. They are commonly located in the small bowel mesentery but are also found in the mesocolon. Most mesenteric cysts cause no symptoms. Traction on the mesen- tery may lead to colicky abdominal pain, which can be mild and recurrent but may appear acutely with vomiting. Volvu-  "

Pinworms, mesenteric lym- phadenitis, and chronic appendicitis are improbable causes of recurrent abdominal pain. H pylori infection is rarely the cause of recurrent abdominal pain. Lactose intolerance usu- ally causes abdominal distention, gas, and diarrhea with milk ingestion. At times, however, abdominal discomfort may be the only symptom. Abdominal migraine and abdominal epilepsy are rare conditions with an episodic character often associated with vomiting. The incidence of peptic gastritis, esophagitis, duodenitis, and ulcer disease is probably under- appreciated. Upper intestinal endoscopy may be useful.  Treatment & Prognosis Treatment consists of reassurance based on a thorough physi- cal appraisal and a sympathetic, age-appropriate explanation of the nature of functional pain. The concept of “visceral hyperal- gesia” or increased pain signaling from physiologic stimuli such as gas, acid secretion, or stool is one that parents can understand and helps them to respond appropriately to the child’s complaints. Reassurance without education is rarely helpful. Regular activity should be resumed, especially school attendance. Therapy for emotional problems is sometimes required, but drugs should be avoided. In older patients, and in those with what appears to be visceral hyperalgesia, amitrip- tyline in low doses may occasionally be helpful. Antispasmodic medications are rarely helpful and should be reserved for patients with more typical irritable bowel complaints. Rasquin A et al: Childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders: Child/ adolescent. Gastroenterology 2006;130:1527 [PMID: 16678566]. ACUTE ABDOMEN An acute abdomen is a constellation of findings indicating an intra-abdominal process that may require surgery. A degree of urgency is implied when this diagnosis is suspected. The pain of an acute abdomen intensifies over time and is rarely relieved without definitive treatment. Pain is often accompa- nied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and anorexia. Pain may be localized or generalized. The abdomen may be distended and tense and bowel sounds reduced or obstruc- tive. Patients appear ill and are reluctant to be examined or moved. The acute abdomen is usually a result of infection of the intra-abdominal or pelvic organs but also occurs with intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, inflammatory conditions, trauma, and some metabolic disorders. Some conditions causing acute abdomen are listed in Table 20–8. Reaching a speedy and accurate diagnosis is critical and requires skill in physical diagnosis, recognition of the symp- toms of a large number of conditions, and a judicious selection of laboratory and radiologic tests. (Acute appendi- citis is discussed earlier in the section on Disorders of the Small Intestine.) "
622,Malabsorption Syndromes,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,2999,"MALABSORPTION SYNDROMES Malabsorption of ingested food has many causes (Table 20–9). Shortening of the small bowel (usually via surgical resection) and mucosal damage (celiac disease) both reduce surface area. Impaired motility of the small intestine may interfere with normal propulsive movements and mixing of food with pancreatic and biliary secretions. Anaerobic bacteria prolif- erate under these conditions and impair fat absorption by deconjugation of bile acids (intestinal pseudo-obstruction, postoperative blind loop syndrome). Impaired intestinal lymphatic (congenital lymphangiectasia) or venous drainage also causes malabsorption. Diseases reducing pancreatic exo- crine function (cystic fibrosis, Shwachman syndrome) or the production and flow of biliary secretions cause nutrient malabsorption. Malabsorption of specific nutrients may be genetically determined (disaccharidase deficiency, glucose- galactose malabsorption, and abetalipoproteinemia).  Clinical Findings Diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, and abdominal distention are common. Stool may be bulky, foul, and pale with fat malabsorption or loose when diarrhea is osmotically induced. Microscopic examination of stools for neutral fat and fatty acids is a useful screen because most malabsorption syndromes involve some fat malabsorption. Pancreatic insufficiency is associated with neutral fat (triglycer- ides) in the stool. Fatty acids are the major fatty material found in the stool of patients with mucosal and liver disease. Quantitation of fat malabsorption requires measuring fat excreted in the feces as a proportion of fat intake for a defined Table 20–8. Causes of acute abdomen.

631,Liver Disorders,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,71,"LIVER DISORDERS PROLONGED NEONATAL  CHOLESTATIC JAUNDICE The main clinical features of disorders causing prolonged neonatal cholestasis are (1) jaundice with elevated serum conjugated (or direct) bilirubin fraction (> 2 mg/dL or > 20% of total bilirubin), (2) variably acholic stools, (3) dark urine, and (4) hepatomegaly. Prolonged neonatal cholestasis (conditions with de- creased bile flow) has intrahepatic and extrahepatic causes. Specific clinical clues (Table 21–1) distinguish these two major categories of jaundice in 85% of cases. Histologic examination of tissue obtained by percutaneous liver biopsy increases the accuracy of differentiation to 95% (Table 21–2). INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Elevated total and conjugated bilirubin.  Hepatomegaly and dark urine.  Patency of extrahepatic biliary tree.  General Considerations Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by hepatocyte dys- function and patency of the extrahepatic biliary system. A specific cause can be identified in about 50% of cases. Patency of the extrahepatic biliary tract is suggested by pigmented stools and lack of bile duct proliferation on liver biopsy. It can be confirmed least invasively by hepatobiliary scintigraphy using technetium-99m (99mTc)-diethyliminodi- acetic acid (diethyl-IDA [DIDA]). Radioactivity in the bowel within 4–24 hours is evidence of bile duct patency. Finding bilirubin in duodenal aspirates also confirms pat- ency. Patency can also be determined by cholangiography carried out intraoperatively, percutaneously by transhepatic cholecystography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan- creatography (ERCP) using a pediatric-size side-viewing endoscope. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in infants is of limited use and highly dependent on the operator and equipment. 1. Perinatal or Neonatal  Hepatitis Resulting from Infection This diagnosis is considered in infants with jaundice, hepa- tomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, fever, and petechiae. It is important to identify perinatally acquired viral, bacterial, or protozoal infections (Table 21–3). Infection may occur transplacentally, by ascent through the cervix into amniotic fluid, from swallowed contaminated fluids (maternal blood, urine) during delivery, from blood transfusions adminis- tered in the early neonatal period, or from breast milk or environmental exposure. Infectious agents associated with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis include herpes simplex virus, varicella virus, enteroviruses (coxsackievirus and echovirus), cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, adenovi- rus, parvovirus, human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), hepa- titis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Treponema pallidum, and Toxoplasma gondii. Although hep- atitis C may be transmitted vertically, it rarely causes neona- tal cholestasis.

631,Prolonged Neonatal Cholestatic Jaundice,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,87,"PROLONGED NEONATAL  CHOLESTATIC JAUNDICE The main clinical features of disorders causing prolonged neonatal cholestasis are (1) jaundice with elevated serum conjugated (or direct) bilirubin fraction (> 2 mg/dL or > 20% of total bilirubin), (2) variably acholic stools, (3) dark urine, and (4) hepatomegaly. Prolonged neonatal cholestasis (conditions with de- creased bile flow) has intrahepatic and extrahepatic causes. Specific clinical clues (Table 21–1) distinguish these two major categories of jaundice in 85% of cases. Histologic examination of tissue obtained by percutaneous liver biopsy increases the accuracy of differentiation to 95% (Table 21–2). INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Elevated total and conjugated bilirubin.  Hepatomegaly and dark urine.  Patency of extrahepatic biliary tree.  General Considerations Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by hepatocyte dys- function and patency of the extrahepatic biliary system. A specific cause can be identified in about 50% of cases. Patency of the extrahepatic biliary tract is suggested by pigmented stools and lack of bile duct proliferation on liver biopsy. It can be confirmed least invasively by hepatobiliary scintigraphy using technetium-99m (99mTc)-diethyliminodi- acetic acid (diethyl-IDA [DIDA]). Radioactivity in the bowel within 4–24 hours is evidence of bile duct patency. Finding bilirubin in duodenal aspirates also confirms pat- ency. Patency can also be determined by cholangiography carried out intraoperatively, percutaneously by transhepatic cholecystography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan- creatography (ERCP) using a pediatric-size side-viewing endoscope. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in infants is of limited use and highly dependent on the operator and equipment. 1. Perinatal or Neonatal  Hepatitis Resulting from Infection This diagnosis is considered in infants with jaundice, hepa- tomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, fever, and petechiae. It is important to identify perinatally acquired viral, bacterial, or protozoal infections (Table 21–3). Infection may occur transplacentally, by ascent through the cervix into amniotic fluid, from swallowed contaminated fluids (maternal blood, urine) during delivery, from blood transfusions adminis- tered in the early neonatal period, or from breast milk or environmental exposure. Infectious agents associated with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis include herpes simplex virus, varicella virus, enteroviruses (coxsackievirus and echovirus), cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, adenovi- rus, parvovirus, human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), hepa- titis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Treponema pallidum, and Toxoplasma gondii. Although hep- atitis C may be transmitted vertically, it rarely causes neona- tal cholestasis.

639,Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (Byler Disease),Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,23,"PROGRESSIVE FAMILIAL INTRAHEPATIC  CHOLESTASIS (BYLER DISEASE) PFIC is a group of disorders presenting as pruritus, diar- rhea, jaundice, and failure to thrive in the first 6–12 months of life. PFIC type I (Byler disease), caused by mutations in the FIC1 gene, is associated with low to normal serum levels of GGT and cholesterol and elevated levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases, and bile acids. Diar- rhea and pruritus are common. Liver biopsy demonstrates cellular cholestasis, sometimes with a paucity of interlobu- lar bile ducts and centrolobular fibrosis that progresses to cirrhosis. Electron microscopy shows diagnostic granular “Byler bile” in canaliculi. Treatment includes administration of UDCA, partial biliary diversion if the condition is unresponsive to UDCA, and liver transplantation. With partial biliary diversion or ileal exclusion surgery, many patients show improved growth and liver histology, reduction in symptoms and, thus, avoidance of liver transplantation. PFIC type II is caused by mutations in the bile salt export pump (BSEP) gene, which codes for an adenosine triphosphate–depen- dent canalicular bile salt transport protein. These patients are clinically and biochemically similar to PFIC type I patients and have similar liver histology except for more “giant cells” and treatment options. There is an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients. PFIC type III is caused by mutations in the multiple drug resistance protein type 3 (MDR3) gene, which encodes a canalicular protein that pumps phospholipid into bile. Serum GGT and bile acid levels are elevated, bile duct proliferation and portal tract fibrosis are seen in liver biopsies, and bile phospholipid levels are low. Treatment is similar to that for other forms of PFIC except for partial biliary diversion. Bile acid synthesis defects are clinically similar to PFIC I and PFIC II, with low serum levels of GGT and cholesterol; however, the serum level of total bile acids is inappropriately normal or low and urine bile acid analy- sis may identify a synthesis defect. Treatment is with oral cholic acid and UDCA. Knisely AS et al: Hepatocellular carcinoma in ten children under five years of age with bile salt export pump deficiency.

EXTRAHEPATIC NEONATAL CHOLESTASIS Extrahepatic neonatal cholestasis is characterized by com- plete and persistent cholestasis (acholic stools) in the first 3 months of life; lack of patency of the extrahepatic biliary tree proved by intraoperative, percutaneous, or endoscopic cholangiography; firm to hard hepatomegaly; and typical features on histologic examination of liver biopsy tissue (see Table 21–2). Causes include biliary atresia, chole- dochal cyst, spontaneous perforation of the extrahepatic ducts, and intrinsic or extrinsic obstruction of the common duct. 1. Biliary Atresia  General Considerations Biliary atresia is the progressive fibroinflammatory oblitera- tion of the lumen of all, or part of, the extrahepatic biliary tree presenting within the first 3 months of life. In Americans of European origin, biliary atresia occurs in 1:10,000– 1:18,000 births, and the incidence in both sexes is equal. In Asian Americans the incidence is higher and the disorder is more common in girls. The abnormality found most com- monly is complete atresia of all extrahepatic biliary struc- tures. There appear to be at least two types of biliary atresia: the perinatal form (80% of cases), in which a perinatal insult is believed to initiate inflammatory obstruction and fibrosis of the biliary tree, and the fetal-embryonic form (20% of cases), in which the extrahepatic biliary system did not develop normally. In the perinatal form, meconium and first-passed stools are usually normal in color, suggesting early patency of the ducts. Evidence obtained from surgically removed remnants of the extrahepatic biliary tree suggests an inflammatory or sclerosing cholangiopathy. Although an infectious cause seems reasonable, no agent has been consis- tently found in such cases. A role for reovirus type 3 and rotavirus group C has been suggested. In the fetal-embryonic type, the bile duct presumably developed abnormally and is associated with other nonhepatic congenital anomalies. The association of biliary atresia with the polysplenia syndrome (heterotaxia, preduodenal portal vein, interruption of the inferior vena cava, polysplenia, and midline liver) and asple- nia syndrome supports an embryonic origin of biliary atresia in these cases.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Jaundice may be noted in the newborn period and persists beyond age 2–3 weeks. The urine stains the diaper; and the stools are often pale yellow, buff-colored, gray, or acholic. Seepage of bilirubin products across the intestinal mucosa may give some yellow coloration to the stools. Hepatomegaly is common, and the liver may feel firm to hard; splenomeg- aly develops later. Pruritus, digital clubbing, xanthomas, and a rachitic rosary may be noted in older patients. By age 2–6 months, the growth curves reveal poor weight gain. Late in the course, ascites, failure to thrive, bone fractures and bleeding complications occur.   LIVER & PANCREAS 617 PROGRESSIVE FAMILIAL INTRAHEPATIC  CHOLESTASIS (BYLER DISEASE) PFIC is a group of disorders presenting as pruritus, diar- rhea, jaundice, and failure to thrive in the first 6–12 months of life.

Choledochal Cyst Choledochal cysts cause 2–5% of cases of extrahepatic neo- natal cholestasis; the incidence is fourfold higher in girls and higher in patients of Asian descent. In most cases, the clinical manifestations, basic laboratory findings, and histopatho- logic features on liver biopsy are indistinguishable from those associated with biliary atresia. Neonatal symptomatic cysts are usually associated with atresia of the distal common duct—accounting for the diagnostic dilemma—and may simply be part of the spectrum of biliary atresia. Ultrasonog- raphy or MRI reveals the presence of a cyst. Immediate surgery is indicated once abnormalities in clotting factors have been corrected and bacterial cholangitis, if present, has been treated with intravenous antibiotics. In older children, choledochal cyst presents as recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, vomiting, obstructive jaun- dice, or pancreatitis, or as a right abdominal mass. Excision of the cyst and choledocho–Roux-en-Y jejunal anastomosis are recommended. In some cases, because of technical problems, only the mucosa of the cyst can be removed with jejunal anastomosis to the proximal bile duct. Anastomo- sis of cyst to jejunum or duodenum is not recommended. The prognosis depends on the presence or absence of associated evidence of atresia and the appearance of the intrahepatic ducts. If atresia is found, the prognosis is similar to that described in the preceding section. If an isolated extrahepatic cyst is encountered, the outcome is generally excellent, with resolution of the jaundice and return to normal liver architecture. However, bouts of ascending cholangitis may occur, particularly if intrahepatic cysts are present or obstruction of the anastomotic site develops. The risk of biliary carcinoma developing within the cyst is about 5–15% at adulthood; therefore, cystectomy or excision of cyst mucosa should be undertaken whenever possible.

Spontaneous Perforation  of the Extrahepatic Bile Ducts The sudden appearance of obstructive jaundice, acholic stools, and abdominal enlargement with ascites in a sick newborn is suggestive of this condition. The liver is usually normal in size, and a yellow-green discoloration can often be discerned under the umbilicus or in the scrotum. In 24% of cases, stones or sludge obstructs the common bile duct. DIDA scan or ERCP shows leakage from the biliary tree, and ultra- sonography confirms ascites or fluid around the bile duct. Treatment is surgical. Simple drainage, without attempts at oversewing the perforation, is sufficient in primary perfo- rations. A diversion anastomosis is constructed in cases associated with choledochal cyst or stenosis. The prognosis is generally good. Barnes BH et al: Spontaneous perforation of the bile duct in a toddler: The role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre- atography in diagnosis and therapy.

641,Other Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemic Conditions  (Noncholestatic Nonhemolytic),Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,3713,"OTHER NEONATAL HYPERBILIRUBINEMIC  CONDITIONS (NONCHOLESTATIC NONHEMOLYTIC) This group of disorders is associated with hyperbilirubin- emia of two types: (1) unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, present in breast milk jaundice, Lucey-Driscoll syndrome, congenital hypothyroidism, upper intestinal obstruction, Gilbert disease, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia; and (2) conjugated noncholestatic hyper- bilirubinemia, present in the Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. 1. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia A. Breast Milk Jaundice Persistent elevation of the indirect bilirubin fraction may occur in up to 36% of breast-fed infants. Enhanced β- glucuronidase activity in breast milk is one factor that increases absorption of unconjugated bilirubin. Substances (eg, L-aspartic acid) in casein hydrolysate formulas inhibit this enzyme. The increased enterohepatic shunting of unconjugated bilirubin exceeds the normal conjugating capacity in the liver of these infants. The mutation for Gilbert syndrome predisposes to breast milk jaundice and to more prolonged jaundice. Low volumes of ingested breast milk may also contribute to jaundice in the first week of life. Hyperbilirubinemia does not usually exceed 20 mg/dL, with most cases in the range of 10–15 mg/dL. In patients whose bilirubin levels are above 4–5 mg/dL, the jaundice is noticeable by the fifth to seventh day of breast feeding. It may accentuate the underlying physiologic jaundice—espe- cially early, when total fluid intake may be less than optimal. Except for jaundice, the physical examination is usually normal; urine does not stain the diaper, and the stools are golden yellow. The jaundice peaks before the third week of life and clears before age 3 months in almost all infants, even when breast feeding is continued. All infants who remain jaundiced past age 2–3 weeks should have measurements of conjugated bilirubin to exclude hepatobiliary disease.   LIVER & PANCREAS 621 early. An auxiliary orthotopic transplantation also relieves the jaundice while the patient retains native liver. Hepatocyte transplantation is experimental. A milder form (type 2) with both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance is rarely associated with neurologic complications. Hyperbilirubinemia is less severe, and the bile is pigmented and contains bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide. Patients with this form respond to phenobar- bital with lowering of serum bilirubin levels. An increased proportion of monoconjugated and diconjugated bilirubin in the bile follows phenobarbital treatment. Liver biopsy find- ings and LFTs are consistently normal in both types.

Drug-Induced Hyperbilirubinemia Vitamin K3 (menadiol) may elevate indirect bilirubin levels by causing hemolysis. Vitamin K1 (phytonadione) can be used safely in neonates. Carbamazepine can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy. Rifampin and antiretroviral protease inhibitors may cause unconjugated hyperbilirubin- emia. Other drugs (eg, ceftriaxone, sulfonamides) may dis- place bilirubin from albumin, potentially increasing the risk of kernicterus—especially in the sick premature infant. 2. Conjugated Noncholestatic  Hyperbilirubinemia (Dubin-Johnson  Syndrome & Rotor Syndrome) These diagnoses are suspected when persistent or recurrent conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice occur and liver function tests are normal. The basic defect in Dubin- Johnson syndrome is in the multiple organic anion transport protein (MRP2) of the bile canaliculus, causing impaired hepatocyte excretion of conjugated bilirubin into bile. A variable degree of impairment in uptake and conjugation complicates the clinical picture. Transmission is autosomal recessive, so a positive family history is occasionally obtained. In Rotor syndrome, the defect lies in hepatic uptake and storage of bilirubin. Bile acids are metabolized normally, so that cholestasis does not occur. Bilirubin values range from 2–5 mg/dL, and other LFTs are normal. In Rotor syndrome, the liver is normal; in Dubin- Johnson syndrome, it is darkly pigmented on gross inspec- tion and may be enlarged. Microscopic examination reveals numerous dark-brown pigment granules consisting of poly- mers of epinephrine metabolites, especially in the centrilob- ular regions. However, the amount of pigment varies within families, and some jaundiced family members may have no demonstrable pigmentation in the liver. Otherwise, the liver is histologically normal. Oral cholecystography fails to visu- alize the gallbladder in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, but is normal in Rotor syndrome. Differences in the excretion patterns of bromosulfophthalein, in results of DIDA choles- cintigraphy, in urinary coproporphyrin I and III levels, and in the serum pattern of monoglucuronide and diglucuronide conjugates of bilirubin can help distinguish between these two conditions. Genotyping of MRP2 is available. Choleretic agents (eg, UDCA) may help reduce the cholestasis in infants with Dubin-Johnson syndrome.

643,Hepatitis A,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,4011,"HEPATITIS A ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Gastrointestinal upset (anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea).  Jaundice.  Liver tenderness and enlargement.  Abnormal LFTs.  Local epidemic of hepatitis A infection.  Positive anti–hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM antibody.  General Considerations Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection occurs in both epidemic and sporadic fashion (Table 21–6). Transmission by the fecal-oral route explains epidemic outbreaks from contami- nated food or water supplies, including by food handlers. Viral particles are found in stools during the acute phase of hepatitis A infection and are similar in appearance to the enteroviruses. Sporadic cases usually result from contact with an infected individual. Transmission through blood products obtained during the viremic phase is a rare event, although it has occurred in a newborn nursery. The overt form of the disease is easily recognized by the clinical manifestations. However, two thirds of children are asymp- tomatic, and two thirds of symptomatic children are anic- teric. Therefore, most symptomatic children with HAV are believed to have gastroenteritis. Lifelong immunity to HAV follows infection. In developing countries, most children are   LIVER & PANCREAS 623 Percutaneous liver biopsy is rarely indicated. “Balloon cells” and acidophilic bodies are characteristic histologic findings. Liver cell necrosis may be diffuse or focal, with accompanying infiltration of inflammatory cells containing polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, particularly in portal areas. Some bile duct proliferation may be seen in the perilobular portal areas along- side areas of bile stasis. Regenerative liver cells and proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells are present. Occasionally massive hepatocyte necrosis occurs, portending a bad prognosis.  Differential Diagnosis Before jaundice appears, the symptoms are those of nonspe- cific viral enteritis. Other diseases with somewhat similar onset include pancreatitis, infectious mononucleosis, lep- tospirosis, drug-induced hepatitis, Wilson disease, autoim- mune hepatitis, and other hepatitis viruses. Acquired CMV disease may also mimic HAV, although lymphadenopathy is usually present in the former.  Prevention Isolation of the patient during initial phases of illness is indicated, although most patients with hepatitis A are non- infectious by the time the disease becomes overt. Stool, diapers, and other fecally stained clothing should be handled with care for 1 week after the appearance of jaundice. Passive-active immunization of exposed susceptible per- sons can be achieved by giving standard immune globulin, 0.02–0.04 mL/kg intramuscularly. Illness is prevented in 80– 90% of individuals if immune globulin is given within 1–2 weeks of exposure. Alternatively, HAV vaccine can be given following exposure, with equal efficacy at preventing symp- tomatic HAV infection. Individuals traveling to endemic disease areas should receive HAV vaccine or 0.02–0.06 mL/ kg of immune globulin as prophylaxis if there is insufficient time (< 2 weeks) for the initial dose of vaccine. All children older than 12 months with chronic liver disease should receive two doses of HAV vaccine 6 months apart. It is currently recommended that all children 12–23 months of age receive HAV vaccination in the United States.  Treatment No specific treatment measures are required. Sedatives and corticosteroids should be avoided. At the start of the illness, a light diet is preferable. During the icteric phase, lower-fat foods may diminish gastrointestinal symptoms but do not affect overall outcome. Drugs and elective surgery should be avoided.  Prognosis Ninety-nine percent of children recover without sequelae. In rare cases of fulminant hepatitis, the patient may die in 5 days or may survive as long as 1–2 months without liver transplantation. The prognosis is poor if hepatic coma or ascites develop; orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated under these circumstances. Incomplete resolution can cause a prolonged hepatitis; however, resolution invariably occurs without long-term hepatic sequelae. Rare cases of aplastic anemia following acute infectious hepatitis have been reported. A benign relapse of symptoms may occur in 10– 15% of cases after 6–10 weeks of apparent resolution.

645,Hepatitis B,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,3838,"HEPATITIS B ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Gastrointestinal upset, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea.  Jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, abnormal LFTs.  Serologic evidence of hepatitis B disease: HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBc IgM.  History of parenteral, sexual, or household exposure or maternal HBsAg carriage.  General Considerations In contrast to hepatitis A, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has a longer incubation period of 45–160 days (see Table 21–6). The disease is caused by a DNA virus that is usually acquired perinatally from a carrier mother, or later in life from exposure to contaminated blood through shared nee- dles, needle sticks, skin piercing, or tattoos. It is also sexually transmitted. Transmission via blood products has been almost eliminated by anti-HBc antibody donor-screening protocols. The complete HBV particle is composed of a core (28-nm particle) that is found in the nucleus of infected liver cells and a double outer shell (surface antigen). The surface antigen in blood is termed HBsAg. The antibody to it is anti-HBs. The core antigen is termed HBcAg and its antibody is anti-HBc. A specific anti-HBc IgM antibody occurs during primary viral replication. Another important antigen-antibody system associated with HBV disease is the “e” antigen system. HBeAg, a truncated soluble form of HBcAg, appears in the serum of   LIVER & PANCREAS 625 jaundice seldom persists for more than 2 weeks. HBsAg disappears in 95% of cases at the time of clinical recovery. Persistent asymptomatic infection may occur, particularly in children with vertical transmission, Down syndrome, or leukemia, and in those undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Persistence of neonatally acquired HBsAg occurs in 70–90% of infants without immunoprophylaxis or vaccination, and the presence of HBeAg in the HBsAg carrier indicates ongo- ing viral replication. However, 1–2% of children infected at birth will show spontaneous seroconversion of HBeAg each year. If HBV infection is acquired later in childhood, HBV is cleared and recovery occurs in 90–95% of patients. Chronic hepatitis B disease predisposes the patient to development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Once chronic HBV infection is established, surveillance for development of hepatocellular carcinoma with serum α-fetoprotein is performed biannu- ally and ultrasonography yearly. Routine HBV vaccination of newborns in endemic countries has reduced the incidence of fulminant hepatic failure, chronic hepatitis, and hepatocellu- lar carcinoma in children.

647,Hepatitis C,Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,1955,"HEPATITIS C  General Considerations Hepatitis C virus (HCV) virus is the most common cause of non-B chronic hepatitis (90% of post-transfusion hepatitis cases) (see Table 21–6). Risk factors in adults and older children include illicit use of intravenous drugs (40%), occupational or sexual exposure (10%), and transfusions (10%); 30% of cases have no known risk factors. In children, most cases are now associated with transmission from an infected mother or other household transmission. In the past, children with hemophilia or on chronic hemodialysis were at significant risk. The risk from transfused blood products has diminished greatly (from 1–2:100 to 1:100,000 units of blood) since the advent of blood testing for ALT and anti-HCV. HCV infection has also been caused by contami- nated immune serum globulin preparations. Vertical trans- mission from HCV-infected mothers occurs more com- monly with mothers who are HIV-positive (15–20%) compared with those who are HIV-negative (5–6%). About 0.4% of adolescents and 1.5% of adults in the United States have serologic evidence of infection. Vertically infected infants often have elevated ALT levels, but do not appear ill; long-term outcome is unknown, however 20–30% of infants recover completely. Transmission of the virus from breast milk is probably rare. HCV rarely causes fulminant hepatitis in children or adults in Western countries, but different serotypes do so in Asia. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus in the flavivirus family. At least seven genotypes of HCV exist. Several well- defined HCV antigens are the basis for serologic antibody tests. The third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for anti-HCV is highly accurate. Anti- HCV is generally present when symptoms occur; however, test results may be negative in the first few months of infection. The presence of HCV RNA in serum indicates active infection.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The incubation period is 1–5 months, with insidious onset of symptoms. Many childhood cases, especially those acquired vertically, are asymptomatic despite development of chronic hepatitis. Flulike prodromal symptoms and jaundice occur in less than 25% of cases. Hepatosplenomegaly may or may not be evident in chronic hepatitis. Ascites, clubbing, palmar erythema, or spider angiomas are rare and indicate progres- sion to cirrhosis. B. Laboratory Findings Fluctuating mild to moderate elevations of aminotrans- ferases over long periods are characteristic of chronic HCV infection. Diagnosis is established by the presence of anti- HCV (third-generation ELISA) confirmed by the radioim- munoblot assay or HCV RNA by PCR. Anti-HCV is acquired passively at birth from infected mothers and cannot be used to confirm disease in the neonate for the first 15 months. HCV RNA testing should be performed in suspected cases. Results of this test may be negative in the first month of life, but become positive by 4 months. Percutaneous liver biopsy should be considered in chronic cases. Histologic examination shows portal triaditis with chronic inflammatory cells, occasional lymphocyte nodules in portal tracts, mild macrovesicular steatosis, and variable bridging necrosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis; most children have only mild to moderate fibrosis on liver biopsy. Cirrhosis in adults generally requires 20–30 years of chronic HCV infec- tion, but it has occasionally developed sooner in children.  Differential Diagnosis HCV disease should be distinguished from HAV and HBV disease by serologic testing. Other causes of cirrhosis in children should be considered in cases of chronic illness,   CHAPTER 21 626 such as Wilson disease or α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Chronic hepatitis may also be caused by drug reactions, autoimmune disease, or steatohepatitis.  Treatment Treatment of acute HCV hepatitis is supportive. Indications for treatment of chronic infection will be determined by current clinical trials. Chronic hepatitis caused by HCV responds to combined interferon-α (3 million U/m2 three times a week for 6–12 months) and ribavirin (15 mg/kg/d), with sustained response rates of 30–50%. The response is poorer in those who have infections with genotype 1a or 1b and very good for genotypes 2 and 3. Long-acting (pegylated) interferon (with or without ribavirin), which has been stud- ied in adults, is more effective, with sustained response rates up to 60–70%. This therapy is being tested in children. End- stage liver disease secondary to HCV responds well to liver transplantation, although reinfection is common and is occa- sionally rapidly progressive. Pre- and post-transplant antivi- ral therapy may reduce the risk of reinfection. There is no vaccine, and no benefit from using immune globulin in infants born to infected mothers. Elective cesarean delivery of HCV-infected pregnant women with a high titer of circulat- ing virus may lessen the likelihood for vertical transmission.  Prognosis In adults, 70–80% of HCV patients develop chronic hepati- tis, and cirrhosis develops in 20% of those with chronic infection for 10–30 years. Alcohol intake, and concomitant obesity and fatty liver, increase this risk. HCV is now the leading indication for liver transplantation in adults. A strong association exists between chronic HCV disease and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma after as little as 15 years. The outcome in children is less well defined, although cirrhosis may develop rapidly in rare cases or after decades. About 50% of children infected by transfusion in the first few years of life develop chronic infection. The prognosis for infants infected at birth with concomitant HIV infection is unknown, but the course appears benign for the first 10 years of life. In adults, chronic HCV infection has been associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia, polyarteritis nodosa, a sicca-like syndrome, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

648,Hepatitis D (Delta Agent),Respiratory Tract & Mediastinum ,3091,"HEPATITIS D (DELTA AGENT) The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a 35-nm defective virus that requires a coat of HBsAg to be infectious (see Table 21–6). Thus, HDV infection can occur only in the presence of HBV infection. In developing countries, transmission is by inti- mate contact; in western countries, by parenteral exposure. HDV is rare in North America. HDV can infect simulta- neously with HBV, causing acute hepatitis, or can superin- fect a patient with chronic HBV infection, predisposing the individual to chronic hepatitis or fulminant hepatitis. In children, the association between chronic HDV coinfection with HBV and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis is strong. Vertical HDV transmission is rare.

Several therapies have failed to affect outcome, including exchange transfusion, plasmapheresis with plasma exchange, total body washout, charcoal hemoperfusion, and hemodialysis using a special high-permeability membrane. Hyperam- monemia and bleeding should be controlled. Extracorporeal hepatic support devices are being developed to help bridge patients to liver transplantation or allow for liver regenera- tion. Orthotopic liver transplantation is successful in 60– 85% of cases; however, patients in grade 4 coma may not always recover cerebral function. Therefore, patients in ALF should be transferred prior to the development of hepatic coma to centers where liver transplantation can be per- formed. Criteria for deciding when to perform transplanta- tion are not firmly established; however, serum bilirubin over 20 mg/dL, INR greater than 4, and factor V levels less than 20% indicate a poor prognosis. Living related donors may be required for transplantation in a timely fashion. The prognosis is better for acetaminophen ingestion, particularly when N-acetylcysteine treatment is given. Corticosteroids may be harmful, except in autoimmune hepatitis for which steroids may reverse the ALF. Acyclovir is essential in herpes simplex infection. Sterilization of the colon with oral antibiotics such as metronidazole, neomycin, or gentamicin is recommended. An alternative is acidification of the colon with lactulose, 1–2 mL/kg three or four times daily, which reduces blood ammonia levels and traps ammonia in the colon. Some centers use N-acetylcysteine in all patients, although it is only of proven benefit in acetaminophen toxicity. Close monitoring of fluid and electrolytes is mandatory and requires a central venous line. Ten percent dextrose solutions should be infused (6–8 mg/kg/min) to maintain normal blood glucose. Diuretics, sedatives, and tranquilizers should be used sparingly. Early signs of cerebral edema are treated with infusions of mannitol (0.5–1.0 g/kg). Comatose patients are intubated, given mechanical ventilatory support, and monitored for signs of infection. Coagulopathy is treated with fresh-frozen plasma, recombinant factor VIIa, other clotting factor concentrates, platelet infusions, or exchange transfusion. Plasmapheresis and hemodialysis may help stabi- lize a patient while awaiting liver transplantation. Epidural monitoring for increased intracranial pressure (hepatic coma stages 3 and 4) in patients awaiting liver transplantation is advocated by some. Artificial hepatic support devices are being developed. Continuous venous–venous dialysis may be helpful to maintain fluid balance. Prophylactic immune glob- ulin, 0.02 mL/kg intramuscularly, should be given to close contacts of patients with HAV infection.  Prognosis The prognosis is primarily dependent on etiology and depth of coma. Children with acute acetaminophen toxicity have a high rate of spontaneous survival. Only 20–30% of children with stage 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy will have a spontaneous recovery. In children with indeterminate ALF, 40% will have a spontaneous recovery. Data from a recent large study suggest that the spontaneous recovery rate is about 40–50% when all causes of ALF are combined; 30% of patients will receive a liver transplant; and 20% will die without a transplant. Exchange transfusions or other modes of heroic therapy do not improve survival figures. The presence of nests of liver cells amounting to more than 25% of the total cells seen on liver biopsy examination and rising levels of clotting factors V and VII, coupled with rising levels of serum α-fetoprotein, may signify a more favorable prognosis. The survival rate in patients who undergo liver transplantation is 60–85%. Dhawan A et al: Approaches to "

AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Acute or chronic hepatitis.  Hypergammaglobulinemia.  Positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti–smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA), anti–liver-kidney microso- mal (LKM) antibodies, or anti–soluble liver antibodies (SLA).  General Considerations Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is most common in adolescent girls, although it occurs at all ages and in either sex. Rarely, AIH evolves from drug-induced hepatitis (eg, minocycline) or may develop in conjunction with such diseases as ulcer- ative colitis, Sjögren syndrome, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Wilson disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, and bile acid synthesis defects may present similarly as chronic hepatitis. A positive HBsAg test implicates HBV, and a positive HCV PCR suggests HCV infection. Positive autoantibodies, elevated serum IgG, and systemic manifesta- tions (eg, arthralgia, weight loss, acne, and amenorrhea) are characteristic of AIH. A genetic susceptibility to development of this entity is suggested by the increased incidence of the histocompatibil- ity antigens HLA-A1 and HLA-B8. Increased autoimmune   LIVER & PANCREAS 629 disease in families of patients and a high prevalence of seroimmunologic abnormalities have been noted in relatives. Occasionally patients have an “overlap syndrome” of AIH and primary sclerosing cholangitis.  Clinical Findings Fever, malaise, recurrent or persistent jaundice, skin rash, arthritis, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, acne, pleurisy, pericardi- tis, or ulcerative colitis may be found in the history of these patients, or asymptomatic hepatomegaly or splenomegaly may be found on examination. Occasionally patients present in acute liver failure. Cutaneous signs of chronic liver disease may be noted (eg, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, and digital clubbing). Hepatosplenomegaly is frequently present. LFTs reveal moderate elevations of serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and serum alkaline phosphatase. Serum albumin may be low. Serum IgG levels are strikingly elevated (in the range of 2– 6 g/dL). Low levels of C3 complement have been reported. Three subtypes of disease have been described based on autoan- tibodies present: type 1—anti–smooth muscle (antiactin); type 2—anti-LKM (anti–cytochrome P-450); and type 3—anti-SLA. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens shows loss of the lobular limiting plate, and interface hepatitis (“piecemeal” necrosis). Portal fibrosis, an inflammatory reaction of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the portal areas and perivascularly, and some bile duct and Kupffer cell proliferation and pseudolobule formation may be present. Cirrhosis may exist at diagnosis in up to 50% of patients.  Differential Diagnosis Laboratory and histologic findings differentiate other types of chronic hepatitis (eg, HBV, HCV, and HDV infection; steatohepatitis; Wilson disease; α1-antitrypsin deficiency; primary sclerosing cholangitis). Primary sclerosing cholangi- tis occasionally presents in a manner similar to AIH, includ- ing the presence of autoantibodies. Wilson disease and α1- antitrypsin deficiency must be excluded if HBV and HCV studies are negative. Anti-HCV antibodies can be falsely positive and should be confirmed by HCV PCR. Drug- induced (minocycline, isoniazid, methyldopa, pemoline) chronic hepatitis should be ruled out.  Complications Untreated disease that continues for months to years eventu- ally results in postnecrotic cirrhosis, with complications of portal hypertension. Persistent malaise, fatigue, amenorrhea, and anorexia parallel disease activity. Bleeding from esoph- ageal varices and development of ascites usually usher in hepatic failure.  Treatment Corticosteroids (prednisone, 2 mg/kg/d) decrease the mortality rate during the early active phase of the disease. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), 1–2 mg/kg/d, is of value in decreasing the side effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy but should not be used alone during the induction phase of treatment. Steroids are reduced over a 3- to 12-month period, and azathio- prine is continued for 1–2 years if AST and ALT remain consis- tently normal. Liver biopsy is performed before stopping aza- thioprine therapy; if inflammation persists, then azathioprine is continued. Thiopurine methyltransferase activity should be assessed prior to starting azathioprine, to prevent extremely high blood levels and severe bone marrow toxicity. Relapses are treated similarly. Many patients require chronic azathioprine or 6MP therapy. UCDA, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methotrexate may be helpful in poorly responsive cases. Mycophenolate mofetil can be substituted for azathioprine, but it is more expen- sive. Liver transplantation is indicated when disease progresses to decompensated cirrhosis despite therapy or in unresponsive cases presenting in acute liver failure. Steroid therapy may be lifesaving in those presenting in acute liver failure.  Prognosis The overall prognosis for AIH is improved significantly with early therapy. Some studies report cures (normal histologic findings) in 15–20% of patients. Relapses (seen clinically and histologically) occur in 40–50% of patients after cessation of therapy; remissions follow repeat treatment. Survival for 10 years is common despite residual cirrhosis. Of children with AIH, 20–50% eventually require liver transplantation. Compli- cations of portal hypertension (bleeding varices, ascites, sponta- neous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatopulmonary syndrome) require specific therapy. Liver transplantation is successful 70– 90% of the time. Disease recurs after transplantation 10–50% of the time and is treated similarly to pretransplant disease.

Nonaclocholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly diag- nosed in children. Patients with NAFLD present with asympto-   CHAPTER 21 630 matic soft hepatomegaly. If nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is present, mild to moderately elevated aminotrans- ferases (2–10 times the upper limit of normal) are also present. ALT is frequently higher than AST. Alkaline phosphatase and GGT may be mildly elevated, but bilirubin is normal. Ultra- sonography or CT scanning indicates fat density in the liver. Liver biopsy shows micro- or macrovesicular steatosis in simple NAFLD, with the addition of portal tract inflammation, Mal- lory bodies, and variable degrees of portal fibrosis to cirrhosis in NASH. Most cases are associated with overweight state or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of NAFLD is related to the prevalence of obesity in the population. The prevalence is estimated at 10% for children and adolescents with significant racial and ethic variability. One to 3% of adolescents in the United States may have NASH, based on the observation that 15–25% of American adolescents are overweight or obese and that roughly 40% will have NAFLD and 10% will have NASH. Steatohepatitis is also associated with Wilson disease, hereditary fructose intolerance, tyrosinemia, HCV hepatitis, cystic fibrosis, fatty acid oxidation defects, kwashiorkor, Reye syndrome, res- piratory chain defects, and toxic hepatopathy (ethanol and others). Treatment is weight reduction and exercise for obesity or treatment for the other causes. A pilot trial suggests that vitamin E may be helpful and is currently under study. In addition, improved control of insulin resistance with met- formin or pioglitazone is also under study in NASH. Cirrhosis and liver failure have been described in adults with this disease.

652,α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Liver Disease,Cardiovascular Diseases ,2328,"α1-ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY LIVER DISEASE ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Serum α1-antitrypsin level < 50–80 mg/dL.  Identification of a specific protease inhibitor (Pi) phe- notype (PiZZ, PiSZ) or genotype.  Detection of diastase-resistant glycoprotein deposits in periportal hepatocytes.  Histologic evidence of liver disease.  Family history of early-onset pulmonary disease or liver disease.  General Considerations The disease is caused by a deficiency in α1-antitrypsin, a protease inhibitor (Pi) system, predisposing patients to chronic liver disease and an early onset of pulmonary emphysema. It is most often associated with the Pi pheno- types ZZ and SZ. Heterozygotes may have a slightly higher incidence of liver disease. The exact relationship between low levels of serum α1-antitrypsin and the development of liver disease is unclear. Emphysema develops because of a lack of inhibition of neutrophil elastase, which destroys pulmonary connective tissue. The accumulation of misfolded aggregates of α1-antitrypsin protein in the liver causes the liver injury by unclear mechanisms. Although all patients with the ZZ genotype eventually have antitrypsin inclusions in hepato- cytes, only about 15–20% develop significant liver disease. Thus another genetic or environmental modifier must be involved. An associated abnormality in the microsomal dis- posal of accumulated aggregates may contribute to the liver disease phenotype. About 10–20% of affected individuals present with neo- natal cholestasis. About 10% of individuals with α1-antitryp- sin deficiency have clinically significant liver injury by age 18 years. Very few children have significant pulmonary involve- ment. Most affected children are completely asymptomatic, with no laboratory or clinical evidence of liver or lung disease.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs α1-Antitrypsin deficiency should be considered in all infants with neonatal cholestasis. Serum GGT is usually, but not always, elevated. Jaundice, acholic stools, and malabsorption may also be present. Infants are often small for gestational age, and hepatosplenomegaly may be present. The family history may be positive for emphysema or cirrhosis. In older children, hepatomegaly or physical findings suggestive of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, especially in the face of a negative history of liver disease, should always lead one to consider α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Recurrent pulmonary disease (bronchitis, pneumonia) may be present in a few older children. B. Laboratory Findings Levels of the α1-globulin fraction may be less than 0.2 mg/dL on serum protein electrophoresis. α1-Antitrypsin level is low (< 50–80 mg/dL) in homozygotes (ZZ). Specific Pi phenotyp- ing should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Genotyping is also available. LFTs often reflect underlying hepatic pathologic changes. Hyperbilirubinemia (mixed) and elevated ami- notransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and GGT are present early. Hyperbilirubinemia generally resolves, while amino- transferase and GGT elevation may persist. Signs of cirrhosis and hypersplenism may develop even when LFTs are normal.   LIVER & PANCREAS 633 the clinical course of established cirrhosis. Neurologic symp- toms generally respond to therapy. All siblings should be immediately screened and homozygotes given treatment with copper chelation or zinc acetate therapy, even if asymp- tomatic.

CIRRHOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Underlying liver disease.  Nodular hard liver.  Nodular liver on abdominal imaging.  Liver biopsy demonstrating cirrhosis.  General Considerations Cirrhosis is a histologically defined condition of the liver characterized by diffuse hepatocyte injury and regeneration, an increase in connective tissue (bridging fibrosis), and disorganization of the lobular and vascular architecture (regenerative nodules). It may be micronodular or macro- nodular in appearance. It is the vasculature distortion that leads to increased resistance to blood flow, producing portal hypertension and its consequences. Many liver diseases may progress to cirrhosis. In children, the two most common forms of cirrhosis are postnecrotic and biliary, with different causes, symptomatology, and treatment requirements. Both forms can eventually lead to liver failure and death. In the pediatric population, postnecrotic cirrhosis is often a result of acute or chronic liver disease (eg, idiopathic neonatal giant-cell hepatitis, viral hepatitis [HBV, HCV], autoimmune or drug-induced hepatitis); more recently, NAFLD; or certain inborn errors of metabolism (see Table 21–5). Cirrhosis is an exceptional outcome of HAV infection and only follows massive hepatic necrosis. The evolution to cirrhosis may be insidious, with no recognized icteric phase, as in some cases of HBV or HCV infection, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, or α1-antitrypsin deficiency. At the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis, the underlying liver disease may be active, with abnormal LFTs; or it may be quiescent, with normal LFTs. Most cases of biliary cirrhosis result from congenital abnormalities of the bile ducts (biliary atresia, choledochal cyst), tumors of the bile duct, Caroli disease, PFIC, primary sclerosing cholangitis, paucity of the intrahe- patic bile ducts, and cystic fibrosis. Occasionally, cirrhosis may follow a hypersensitivity reaction to certain drugs such as phenytoin. Parasites (Opisthorchis sinensis, Fasciola, and Ascaris) may be causative in children living in endemic areas.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Malaise, loss of appetite, failure to thrive, and nausea are frequent complaints, especially in anicteric varieties. Easy bruising may be reported. Jaundice may or may not be present. The first indication of underlying liver disease may be ascites, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or hepatic encepha- lopathy. Variable hepatosplenomegaly, spider angiomas, warm skin, palmar erythema, or digital clubbing may be present. A small, shrunken liver may present. Most often, the liver is enlarged slightly, especially in the subxiphoid region, where it has a firm to hard quality and an irregular edge. Ascites may be detected as shifting dullness or a fluid wave. Gynecomastia may be noted in males. Digital clubbing occurs in 10–15% of cases. Pretibial edema often occurs, reflecting underlying hypoproteinemia. In adolescent girls, irregularities of menstruation and amenorrhea may be early complaints. In biliary cirrhosis, patients often have jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, hepatomegaly, and sometimes xanthomas in addition to the previously mentioned clinical findings. Mal- nutrition and failure to thrive due to steatorrhea may be more apparent in this form of cirrhosis. B. Laboratory Findings Mild abnormalities of aminotransferases (AST, ALT) are often present, with a decreased level of albumin and a variable increase in the level of γ-globulins. Prothrombin time is prolonged and may be unresponsive to vitamin K administration. Burr and target red cells may be noted on the peripheral blood smear. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia are present if hypersplenism exists. However, cirrhosis may be present despite normal blood tests. In biliary cirrhosis, elevated conjugated bilirubin, bile acids, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol are common. C. Imaging Hepatic ultrasound or CT examination may demonstrate abnormal hepatic texture and nodules. In biliary cirrhosis,   CHAPTER 21 634 abnormalities of the biliary tree may be apparent by ultrasonog- raphy, CT, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, or cholangiography. D. Pathologic Findings Liver biopsy findings of regenerating nodules and surround- ing fibrosis are hallmarks of cirrhosis. Pathologic features of biliary cirrhosis also include canalicular and hepatocyte cholestasis, as well as plugging of bile ducts. The interlobular bile ducts may be increased or decreased, depending on the cause and the stage of the disease process.  Complications & Treatment Major complications of cirrhosis in childhood include progressive nutritional disturbances, hormonal distur- bances, and the evolution of "
656,Portal Hypertension,Cardiovascular Diseases ,680,"portal hypertension and its complications. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs with increased frequency in the cirrhotic liver, especially in patients with the chronic form of hereditary tyrosinemia or after long-standing HBV or HCV disease. At present, there is no proven medical treatment for cirrhosis, but whenever a treatable condition is identified (eg, Wilson disease, galactosemia, congenital fructose intolerance, auto- immune hepatitis) or an offending agent eliminated (HBV, HCV, drugs, toxins), disease progression can be altered; occasionally regression of fibrosis has been noted. Chil- dren with cirrhosis should receive the hepatitis A and B vaccines, and they should be monitored for the develop- ment of hepatocellular carcinoma with serial serum α- fetoprotein determinations and abdominal ultrasound for hepatic nodules. Liver transplantation may be appropriate in patients with cirrhosis whose disease is continuing to progress, with evidence of worsening hepatic synthetic function, or in whom the complications of cirrhosis are no longer manageable.  Prognosis Postnecrotic cirrhosis has an unpredictable course. With- out transplantation, affected patients may die from liver failure within 10–15 years. Patients with a rising bilirubin, a vitamin K–resistant coagulopathy, or diuretic refrac- tory ascites usually survive less than 1–2 years. The terminal event in some patients may be generalized hem- orrhage, sepsis, or cardiorespiratory arrest. For patients with biliary cirrhosis, the prognosis is similar, except for those with surgically corrected lesions that result in regression or stabilization of the underlying liver condi- tion. With liver transplantation, the long-term survival rate is 70–90%. Hardy SC, Kleinman RE: Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure.

PORTAL HYPERTENSION ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Splenomegaly.  Recurrent ascites.  Variceal hemorrhage.  Hypersplenism.  General Considerations Portal hypertension is defined as an increase in the portal venous pressure to more than 5 mm Hg greater than the inferior vena caval pressure. Portal hypertension is most commonly a result of cirrhosis. Portal hypertension without cirrhosis may be divided into prehepatic, suprahepatic, and intrahepatic causes. Although the specific lesions vary some- what in their clinical signs and symptoms, the consequences of portal hypertension are common to all. A. Prehepatic Portal Hypertension Prehepatic portal hypertension from acquired abnormalities of the portal and splenic veins accounts for 30–50% of cases of variceal hemorrhage in children. A history of neonatal omphalitis, sepsis, dehydration, or umbilical vein catheter- ization may be present. Causes in older children include local trauma, peritonitis (pyelophlebitis), hypercoagulable states, and pancreatitis. Symptoms may occur before age 1 year, but in most cases the diagnosis is not made until age 3–5 years. Patients with a positive neonatal history tend to be sympto- matic earlier. A variety of portal or splenic vein malformations, some of which may be congenital, have been described, including defects in valves and atretic segments. Cavernous transfor- mation is probably the result of attempted collateralization around the thrombosed portal vein rather than a congenital malformation. The site of the venous obstruction may be anywhere from the hilum of the liver to the hilum of the spleen. B. Suprahepatic Vein Occlusion or  Thrombosis (Budd-Chiari Syndrome) No cause can be demonstrated in most instances. One suggested cause is endothelial injury to hepatic veins by bacterial endotoxin, which has been demonstrated experi- mentally. The occasional association of hepatic vein throm- bosis in inflammatory bowel disease favors the presence of endogenous toxins traversing the liver. Vasculitis leading to endophlebitis of the hepatic veins has been described. In addition, hepatic vein obstruction may be secondary to tumor, abdominal trauma, hyperthermia, or sepsis, or it may   LIVER & PANCREAS 637 The prognosis in patients treated by medical and sup- portive therapy may be better than in the surgically treated group, especially when surgery is performed at an early age, although no comparative study has been done. Portacaval encephalopathy is unusual after shunting except when pro- tein intake is excessive, but neurologic outcome may be better in patients who receive a mesorex shunt when com- pared with medical management alone. The mortality rate of hepatic vein obstruction is very high (95%). In veno-occlusive disease, the prognosis is better, with complete recovery possible in 50% of acute forms and 5–10% of subacute forms.

659,Biliary Tract Disease,Cardiovascular Diseases ,2154,"BILIARY TRACT DISEASE 1. Cholelithiasis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  Elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and GGT.  Stones or sludge seen on abdominal ultrasound.  General Considerations Gallstones may develop at all ages in the pediatric population and in utero. Gallstones may be divided into cholesterol stones (which contain more than 50% cholesterol) and pig- ment (black [sterile bile] and brown [infected bile]) stones. Pigment stones predominate in the first decade of life, while cholesterol stones account for up to 90% of gallstones in adolescence. For some patients, gallbladder dysfunction is associated with biliary sludge formation, which may evolve into “sludge balls” or tumefaction bile and then into gall- stones. The process is reversible in many patients.  Clinical Findings A. History Most symptomatic gallstones are associated with acute or recurrent episodes of moderate to severe, sharp right upper quadrant or epigastric pain. The pain may radiate subster- nally or to the right shoulder. On rare occasions, the presen- tation may include a history of jaundice, back pain, or generalized abdominal discomfort, when it is associated with pancreatitis, suggesting stone impaction in the common duct or ampulla hepatopancreatica. Nausea and vomiting may occur during attacks. Pain episodes often occur postprandi- ally, especially after ingestion of fatty foods. The groups at risk for gallstones include patients with known or suspected hemolytic disease; females; teenagers with prior pregnancy; obese individuals; individuals with rapid weight loss; children with portal vein thrombosis; certain racial or ethnic groups, particularly Native Americans (Pima Indians) and Hispanics; infants and children with ileal disease (Crohn disease) or prior ileal resection; patients with cystic fibrosis or Wilson disease; and infants on prolonged parenteral hyperalimenta- tion. Other, less certain risk factors include a positive family history, use of birth control pills, and diabetes mellitus. B. Symptoms and Signs During acute episodes of pain, tenderness is present in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, with a positive inspiratory arrest (Murphy sign), usually without peritoneal signs. While rarely present, scleral icterus is helpful. Evidence of underlying hemolytic disease in addition to icterus may include pallor (anemia), splenomegaly, tachycardia, and high-output cardiac murmur. Fever is unusual in uncomplicated cases. C. Laboratory Findings Laboratory tests are usually normal unless calculi have lodged in the extrahepatic biliary system, in which case the serum bilirubin and GGT (or alkaline phosphatase) may be elevated. Amylase and lipase levels may be increased if stone obstruction occurs at the ampulla hepatopancreatica. D. Imaging Ultrasound evaluation is the best imaging technique, showing abnormal intraluminal contents (stones, sludge) as well as anatomic alterations of the gallbladder or dilation of the biliary ductal system. The presence of an anechoic acoustic shadow differentiates calculi from intraluminal sludge or sludge balls.   LIVER & PANCREAS 641  Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes infectious hepatitis, sec- ondary cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, cystic fibrosis, choledochal cyst, or other anomalies of the biliary tree, including Caroli disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis (see Table 21–8).  Complications Complications include secondary bacterial cholangitis, pan- creatitis, biliary fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Progression to liver failure is common, and the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is higher in PSC.  Treatment No completely effective treatment is available. Patients with early disease may benefit from high-dose UCDA (25–30 mg/ kg/d). Patients with autoimmune markers may benefit from treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine. Antibiotic treatment of cholangitis and dilation and stenting of domi- nant bile duct strictures can reduce symptoms.  Prognosis The majority of patients will eventually require liver transplan- tation, and PSC is the fifth leading indication for liver trans- plantation in the United States. The median duration from the time of diagnosis to end-stage liver disease is 12–15 years. Alvarez F: Autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholan- gitis.

663,Pyogenic & Amebic Liver Abscess,Cardiovascular Diseases ,1862,"PYOGENIC & AMEBIC LIVER ABSCESS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fever and painful enlarged liver.  Ultrasound of liver demonstrating an abscess.  Positive serum ameba antibody or positive bacterial culture of abscess fluid.  General Considerations Pyogenic liver abscesses are often caused by intestinal bacteria seeded via the portal vein from infected viscera and occasion- ally from ascending cholangitis or gangrenous cholecystitis. Blood cultures are positive in up to 60% of patients. The resulting lesion tends to be solitary and located in the right hepatic lobe. Bacterial seeding may also occur from infected burns, pyodermas, and osteomyelitis. Unusual causes include omphalitis, subacute infective endocarditis, pyelonephritis, Crohn disease, and perinephric abscess. In immunocompro- mised patients, S aureus, gram-negative organisms, and fungi may seed the liver from the arterial system. Multiple pyogenic liver abscesses are associated with severe sepsis. Children receiving anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents and children with defects in white blood cell function (chronic granulomatous disease) are prone to pyogenic hepatic abscesses, especially those caused by S aureus. Amoebic liver abscess is rare in children. An increased risk is associated with travel in areas of endemic infection (Mexico, Southeast Asia) within 5 months of presentation. Entamoeba histolytica invasion occurs via the large bowel, although a history of diarrhea (colitis-like picture) is not always obtained.  Clinical Findings With pyogenic liver abscess, nonspecific complaints of fever, chills, malaise, and abdominal pain are frequent. Weight loss ▲ Figure 21–1. Classification of cystic dilation of the bile  ducts. Types I, II, and III are extrahepatic choledochal  cysts.

GB I II III IVa IVb TYPE FINDINGS CBD Mixed extrahepatic and intrahepatic fusiform or cystic dilation (possibly variants of Caroli disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis) Multiple intrahepatic communicating cysts (Caroli disease) Spherical dilation of the common  duct Congenital diverticulum of the  common bile duct  Intraduodenal diverticulum of the common bile duct (choledochocele)   CHAPTER 21 642 is very common, especially in delayed diagnosis. A few patients have shaking chills and jaundice. The dominant complaint is a constant dull pain over an enlarged liver that is tender to palpation. An elevated hemidiaphragm with reduced or absent respiratory excursion may be demon- strated on physical examination and confirmed by fluoros- copy. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis and, at times, anemia. LFTs may be normal or reveal mild elevation of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Fever and abdomi- nal pain are the two most common symptoms of amebic liver abscess. Abdominal tenderness and hepatomegaly are present in over 50%. Early in the course, LFTs may suggest mild hepatitis. An occasional prodrome may include cough, dyspnea, and shoulder pain when rupture of the abscess into the right chest occurs. Consolidation of the right lower lobe is common (10–30% of patients). Ultrasound liver scan is the most useful diagnostic aid in evaluating pyogenic and amebic abscesses, detecting lesions as small as 1–2 cm. MRI, CT, or nuclear scanning with gallium or technetium sulfur colloid may be useful in differ- entiating tumor or hydatid cyst. The distinction between pyogenic and amebic abscesses is best made by indirect hemagglutination test for specific antibody (which is positive in more than 95% of patients with amebic liver disease) and the prompt clinical response of the latter to antiamebic therapy (metronidazole). Exami- nation of material obtained by needle aspiration of the abscess using ultrasound guidance is often diagnostic.  Differential Diagnosis Hepatitis, "
664,Hepatoma,Cardiovascular Diseases ,1614,"hepatoma, hydatid cyst, gallbladder disease, or biliary tract infections can mimic liver abscess. Subphrenic abscesses, empyema, and pneumonia may give a similar picture. Inflammatory disease of the intestines or of the biliary system may be complicated by liver abscess.  Complications Spontaneous rupture of the abscess may occur with exten- sion of infection into the subphrenic space, thorax, perito- neal cavity, and, occasionally, the pericardium. Broncho- pleural fistula with large sputum production and hemoptysis can develop in severe cases. Simultaneously, the amebic liver abscess may be secondarily infected with bacteria (in 10– 20% of patients). Metastatic hematogenous spread to the lungs and the brain has been reported.  Treatment Ultrasound- or CT-guided percutaneous needle aspiration for aerobic and anaerobic culture with simultaneous place- ment of a catheter for drainage, combined with appropriate antibiotic therapy, is the treatment of choice for solitary pyogenic liver abscess. Multiple liver abscesses may also be treated successfully by this method. Surgical intervention may be indicated if rupture occurs outside the capsule of the liver or if enterohepatic fistulae are suspected. Amebic abscesses in uncomplicated cases should be treated promptly with oral metronidazole, 35–50 mg/kg/d, in three divided doses for 10 days. Intravenous metronida- zole can be used for patients unable to take oral medication. Failure to improve after 72 hours of drug therapy suggests superimposed bacterial infection or an incorrect diagnosis. At this point, needle aspiration or surgical drainage is indi- cated. Once oral feedings can be tolerated, a luminal amebi- cide such as iodoquinol should be initiated. Resolution of the abscess cavity occurs over 3–6 months.  Prognosis An unrecognized and untreated pyogenic liver abscess is universally fatal. With drainage and antibiotics, the cure rate is about 90%. Most amebic abscesses are cured with conser- vative medical management; the mortality rate is less than 3%. If extrahepatic complications occur (empyema, bron- chopleural fistula, or pericardial complications), 10–15% of patients will succumb. Kurland JE, Brann OS: Pyogenic and amebic liver abscesses.

LIVER TRANSPLANTATION Orthotopic liver transplantation is indicated in children with end-stage liver disease, acute fulminant hepatic failure, or complications from metabolic liver disorders. Recent advances in immunosuppression (eg, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, use of monoclonal antibodies against T cells, introduction of mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus), better candidate selection, improvements in surgical techniques, antiviral medications, and experience in postoperative management have contributed to improved results. The major indications for childhood transplantation are: 1. A failed Kasai operation or decompensated cirrhosis caused by biliary atresia. 2. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency causing end-stage liver dis- ease. 3.

Alco- hol-induced pancreatitis should be considered in the teenage patient.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs An acute onset of persistent (hours to days), moderate to severe upper abdominal and midabdominal pain occasionally referred to the back, and vomiting, is the common presenting picture. The abdomen is tender, but not rigid, and bowel sounds are diminished, suggesting peritoneal irritation. Abdominal distention is common in infants and younger children. Jaundice is unusual. Ascites may be noted, and a left- sided pleural effusion is present in some patients. Periumbili- cal and flank bruising indicate hemorrhagic pancreatitis. B. Laboratory Findings Leukocytosis and an elevated serum amylase (more than three times normal) should be expected early, except in infants younger than 6 months who may have hypoamylasemia. Serum lipase is elevated and persists longer than serum amylase. The immunoreactive trypsinogen may also be ele- vated. Pancreatic amylase isoenzyme determination can help differentiate nonpancreatic causes (eg, salivary, intestinal, or tubo-ovarian) of serum amylase elevation. Hyperglycemia (serum glucose > 300 mg/dL), hypocalcemia, falling hemato- crit, rising blood urea nitrogen, hypoxemia, and acidosis may all occur in severe cases and imply a poor prognosis. C. Imaging Plain radiographic films of the abdomen may show a local- ized ileus (sentinel loop). Ultrasonography shows decreased echodensity of the gland in comparison with the left lobe of the liver. Pseudocyst formation can occasionally be seen early in the course. CT scanning is better for detecting pancreatic phlegmon, or abscess formation. ERCP or MRCP may be useful in confirming patency of the main pancreatic duct in cases of abdominal trauma; in recurrent acute pancreatitis; or in revealing stones, ductal strictures, and pancreas divisum.  Differential Diagnosis Other causes of acute upper abdominal pain include lesions of the stomach, duodenum, liver, and biliary system; acute gastroenteritis or atypical appendicitis; pneumonia; volvu- lus; intussusception; and nonaccidental trauma.  Complications Complications early in the disease include shock, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, ileus, acute respiratory distress syn- drome, and hypocalcemia. Hypervolemia is seen between the third and fifth day, at which time renal tubular necrosis may occur. The gastrointestinal, neurologic, musculoskeletal, hepatobiliary, dermatologic, and hematologic systems may also be involved. Later, 5–20% of patients develop a pseudocyst heralded by recurrence of abdominal pain and rise in the serum amylase. Up to 60–70% of pseudocysts resolve spontaneously. Infec- tion, hemorrhage, rupture, or fistulization may occur. Phleg- mon formation is common and may extend from the gland into the retroperitoneum or into the lesser sac. Most regress, but some require drainage. Infection in this inflammatory mass may occur. Pancreatic abscess formation, which is rare (3–5%), develops 2–3 weeks after the initial insult. Fever, leukocytosis, and pain suggest this complication; diagnosis is made by ultrasound or CT scanning. "
667,Chronic Pancreatitis,Gastrointestinal Tract ,3281,"Chronic pancreatitis, exocrine or endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and pancre- atic lithiasis are rare sequelae of acute pancreatitis.  Treatment Medical management includes careful attention to fluids, electrolytes, and respiratory status. Gastric decompression may be helpful if there is significant vomiting. Pain should be controlled with opioids. Acid suppression may be helpful. Nutrition is provided by the parenteral or enteral (jejunal) route. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is useful only in necrotizing pancreatitis. Drugs known to produce acute pan- creatitis should be discontinued. Surgical treatment is reserved for traumatic disruption of the gland, intraductal stone, other anatomic obstructive lesions, and unresolved or infected pseudocysts or abscesses. Early endoscopic decompression of the biliary system reduces the morbidity associated with pan- creatitis caused by obstruction of the common bile duct.  Prognosis In the pediatric age group, the prognosis is surprisingly good with conservative management. The mortality rate is 5–10% in patients treated surgically and 1% in those treated only with medication. The morbidity rate is high with surgery as a result of fistula formation.

CHRONIC PANCREATITIS Chronic pancreatitis is differentiated from acute pancreatitis in that the pancreas remains structurally or functionally abnormal after an attack. The causes are multiple and can be divided into toxic- metabolic (eg, alcohol, chronic renal failure, hypercalcemia), idiopathic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent and severe acute pancreatitis, and obstructive pancreatitis (eg, pancreas divisum, choledochal cyst).   CHAPTER 21 646  Clinical Findings The diagnosis often is delayed by the nonspecificity of symp- toms and the lack of persistent laboratory abnormalities. A. Symptoms and Signs There is usually a prolonged history of recurrent upper abdominal pain of variable severity. Radiation of the pain into the back is a frequent complaint. Fever and vomiting are not common. Steatorrhea and symptoms of diabetes may develop later in the course, and malnutrition second- ary to failure of pancreatic exocrine secretions may also occur. B. Laboratory Findings Serum amylase and lipase levels are usually elevated during early acute attacks but are often normal later. Pancreatic insufficiency and reduced volume and bicarbonate response may be found during pancreatic stimulation testing or by determination of fecal pancreatic elastase 1. Mutations of the cationic trypsinogen gene, the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduc- tance regulator gene (CFTR) are associated with recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. Elevated blood glucose and glycohemoglobin levels and glycosuria frequently occur in protracted disease. Sweat chloride should be checked for cystic fibrosis and serum calcium for hyperparathyroidism. C. Imaging Radiographs of the abdomen may show pancreatic calcifica- tions in up to 30% of patients. Ultrasound or CT examina- tion demonstrates pancreatic enlargement, ductal dilation, and calculi in up to 80%. CT is the initial imaging procedure of choice. MRCP or ERCP can show ductal dilation, stones, strictures, or stenotic segments. Endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and staging of chronic pancreatitis is being evaluated.  Differential Diagnosis Other causes of recurrent abdominal pain must be consid- ered. Specific causes of pancreatitis such as hyperparathy- roidism; systemic lupus erythematosus; infectious disease; and ductal obstruction by tumors, stones, or helminths must be excluded by appropriate tests.  Complications Disabling abdominal pain, steatorrhea, malnutrition, pan- creatic pseudocysts, and diabetes are the most frequent long- term complications. Pancreatic carcinoma occurs more fre- quently in chronic pancreatitis, and in up to 40% of patients with hereditary pancreatitis by age 70.  Treatment Medical management of acute attacks is indicated (see Acute Pancreatitis section). If ductal obstruction is strongly sus- pected, endoscopic therapy (balloon dilation, stenting, stone removal, or sphincterotomy) should be pursued. Relapses occur in most patients. Orally ingested nonenteric-coated pancreatic enzymes at mealtime may reduce pain episodes in some patients. Antioxidant therapy is being investigated. Pseudocysts may be marsupialized to the surface or drained into the stomach or into a loop of jejunum if they fail to regress spontaneously. Experience in pediatric patients indi- cates that lateral pancreaticojejunostomy or the Frey proce- dure can reduce pain in patients with a dilated pancreatic duct and may prevent or delay progression of functional pancreatic impairment. Pancreatectomy and islet cell autotransplanta- tion have been used in selected cases of chronic pancreatitis.  Prognosis In the absence of a correctable lesion, the prognosis is not good. Disabling episodes of pain, pancreatic insufficiency, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer may ensue. Narcotic addic- tion and suicide are risks in teenagers with disabling disease.

671,Syndromes with Pancreatic Exocrine  Insufficiency,Gastrointestinal Tract ,23,"SYNDROMES WITH PANCREATIC  EXOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY Several syndromes are associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Clinically, patients present with a history of failure to thrive, diarrhea, fatty stools, and an absence of respiratory symptoms. Laboratory findings include a normal sweat chloride; low fecal pancreatic elastase 1; and low to absent pancreatic lipase, amylase, and trypsin levels on duodenal intubation. Each disorder has several associated clinical features that aid in the differential diagnosis. In Shwachman syndrome, pancreatic exocrine hypoplasia with widespread fatty replacement of the glandular acinar tissue is associated with neutropenia because of maturational arrest of the granulocyte series. Metaphyseal dysostosis and an elevated fetal hemoglobin level are common; immunoglobu- lin deficiency and hepatic dysfunction are also reported. CT examination of the pancreas demonstrates the widespread fatty replacement. Serum immunoreactive trypsinogen levels are extremely low. Other associations of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency include (1) aplastic alae, aplasia cutis, deafness (Johanson- Blizzard syndrome); (2) sideroblastic anemia, developmen- tal delay, seizures, and liver dysfunction (Pearson bone marrow pancreas syndrome); (3) duodenal atresia or steno- sis; (4) malnutrition; and (5) pancreatic hypoplasia or agenesis. The complications and sequelae of deficient pancreatic enzyme secretion are malnutrition, diarrhea, and growth failure. The degree of steatorrhea may lessen with age. Intragastric lipolysis primarily caused by lingual lipase may compensate in patients with low or absent pancreatic func- tion. In Shwachman syndrome, the major sequela is short stature. Increased numbers of infections may result from chronic neutropenia. Neutrophil mobility is also impaired in many patients. In addition, an increased incidence of leuke- mia has been noted in these patients. Pancreatic enzyme and fat-soluble vitamin replacement are required therapy in most patients. The prognosis appears to be good for those able to survive the increased number of bacterial infections early in life and those patients without severe associated defects.

ISOLATED EXOCRINE  PANCREATIC ENZYME DEFECT Normal premature infants and most newborns produce little, if any, pancreatic amylase following meals or exoge- nous hormonal stimulation. This temporary physiologic insufficiency may persist for the first 3–6 months of life and be responsible for diarrhea when complex carbohydrates (cereals) are introduced into the diet. Congenital pancreatic lipase deficiency and congenital colipase deficiency are extremely rare disorders, causing diarrhea and variable malnutrition with malabsorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins. The sweat chloride level is normal, and neutropenia is absent. Treatment is oral replacement of pancreatic enzymes and a low-fat diet or formula containing medium-chain triglycerides. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency of proteolytic enzymes (eg, trypsinogen, trypsin, chymotrypsin) is caused by entero- kinase deficiency, a duodenal mucosal enzyme required for activation of the pancreatic proenzymes. These patients present with malnutrition associated with hypoproteinemia and edema but are free of respiratory symptoms and have a normal sweat test. They respond to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and feeding formulas that contain a casein hydrolysate (eg, Nutramigen, Pregestimil).

They most often arise from ductal or acinar epithelium (malignant adenocarcinoma) or from islet (endocrine) components within the gland, such as the benign insulinoma (adenoma) derived from β cells. Other pancreatic tumors also originate from these pluripotential endocrine cells (gastrinoma, VIPoma, glu- cagonoma). These malignant lesions produce diverse symp- toms, because they release biologically active polypeptides from this ectopic location. The clinical features of these tumors are summarized in Table 21–10. The differential diagnosis of pan- creatic tumors includes Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, and malignant lymphoma. In older children, endoscopic ultra- sonography can aid in localizing these tumors.   LIVER & PANCREAS 649 SYNDROMES WITH PANCREATIC  EXOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY Several syndromes are associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Clinically, patients present with a history of failure to thrive, diarrhea, fatty stools, and an absence of respiratory symptoms. Laboratory findings include a normal sweat chloride; low fecal pancreatic elastase 1; and low to absent pancreatic lipase, amylase, and trypsin levels on duodenal intubation. Each disorder has several associated clinical features that aid in the differential diagnosis. In Shwachman syndrome, pancreatic exocrine hypoplasia with widespread fatty replacement of the glandular acinar tissue is associated with neutropenia because of maturational arrest of the granulocyte series. Metaphyseal dysostosis and an elevated fetal hemoglobin level are common; immunoglobu- lin deficiency and hepatic dysfunction are also reported. CT examination of the pancreas demonstrates the widespread fatty replacement. Serum immunoreactive trypsinogen levels are extremely low. Other associations of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency include (1) aplastic alae, aplasia cutis, deafness (Johanson- Blizzard syndrome); (2) sideroblastic anemia, developmen- tal delay, seizures, and liver dysfunction (Pearson bone marrow pancreas syndrome); (3) duodenal atresia or steno- sis; (4) malnutrition; and (5) pancreatic hypoplasia or agenesis. The complications and sequelae of deficient pancreatic enzyme secretion are malnutrition, diarrhea, and growth failure. The degree of steatorrhea may lessen with age. Intragastric lipolysis primarily caused by lingual lipase may compensate in patients with low or absent pancreatic func- tion. In Shwachman syndrome, the major sequela is short stature. Increased numbers of infections may result from chronic neutropenia. Neutrophil mobility is also impaired in many patients. In addition, an increased incidence of leuke- mia has been noted in these patients. Pancreatic enzyme and fat-soluble vitamin replacement are required therapy in most patients. The prognosis appears to be good for those able to survive the increased number of bacterial infections early in life and those patients without severe associated defects.

671,Isolated Exocrine Pancreatic Enyme Defect,Gastrointestinal Tract ,3035,"ISOLATED EXOCRINE  PANCREATIC ENZYME DEFECT Normal premature infants and most newborns produce little, if any, pancreatic amylase following meals or exoge- nous hormonal stimulation. This temporary physiologic insufficiency may persist for the first 3–6 months of life and be responsible for diarrhea when complex carbohydrates (cereals) are introduced into the diet. Congenital pancreatic lipase deficiency and congenital colipase deficiency are extremely rare disorders, causing diarrhea and variable malnutrition with malabsorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins. The sweat chloride level is normal, and neutropenia is absent. Treatment is oral replacement of pancreatic enzymes and a low-fat diet or formula containing medium-chain triglycerides. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency of proteolytic enzymes (eg, trypsinogen, trypsin, chymotrypsin) is caused by entero- kinase deficiency, a duodenal mucosal enzyme required for activation of the pancreatic proenzymes. These patients present with malnutrition associated with hypoproteinemia and edema but are free of respiratory symptoms and have a normal sweat test. They respond to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and feeding formulas that contain a casein hydrolysate (eg, Nutramigen, Pregestimil).

673,luation of the Kidney & Urinary Tract,Gastrointestinal Tract ,51,"LUATION OF THE  KIDNEY & URINARY TRACT HISTORY When renal disease is suspected, the history should include: 1. Family history of cystic disease, hereditary nephritis, deafness, dialysis, or renal transplantation. 2. Preceding acute or chronic illnesses (eg, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, impetigo, or endocarditis). 3. Rashes or joint pains. 4. Growth delay or failure to thrive. 5. Polyuria, polydipsia, enuresis, urinary frequency, or dysuria. 6. Documentation of hematuria, proteinuria, or discolored urine. 7. Pain (abdominal, costovertebral angle, or flank) or trauma. 8. Sudden weight gain or edema. 9. Drug or toxin exposure. 10. Data pertaining to the newborn with suspected urinary tract disease: prenatal ultrasonographic studies, birth asphyxia, Apgar scores, oligohydramnios, dysmorphic features, abdominal masses, voiding patterns, anoma- lous development, and umbilical artery catheterization. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Important aspects of the physical examination include the height, weight, skin lesions (café-au-lait or ash leaf spots), pallor, edema, or skeletal deformities. Anomalies of the ears, eyes, or external genitalia may be associated with renal anom- alies or disease. The blood pressure should be measured in a quiet setting. The cuff should cover two thirds of the child’s upper arm, and peripheral pulses should be noted. The abdomen should be palpated, with attention to the kidneys, abdominal masses, musculature, and the presence of ascites. An ultrasonic device is useful for measurements in infants. LABORATORY EVALUATION OF RENAL FUNCTION Serum Analysis The standard indicators of renal function are serum levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine; their ratio is normally about 10:1. This ratio may increase when renal perfusion or urine flow is decreased, as in urinary tract obstruction or dehydration. Because serum urea nitrogen levels are more affected by these and other factors (eg, nitrogen intake, catabolism, use of corticosteroids) than are creatinine lev- els, the most reliable single indicator of glomerular func- tion is the serum level of creatinine. For example, an increase in serum creatinine from 0.5 mg/dL to 1.0 mg/dL represents a 50% decrease in glomerular filtration rate. The serum creatinine level of small children should be well under 0.8 mg/dL. Only larger adolescents should have levels exceeding 1 mg/dL. Less precise but nonetheless important indicators of possible renal disease are abnor- malities of serum electrolytes, pH, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, or complement. Glomerular Filtration Rate The endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) in milliliters per minute estimates the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A 24- hour urine collection is usually obtained; however, in small children from whom collection is difficult, a 12-hour day- time specimen, collected when urine flow rate is greatest, is acceptable. The procedure for collecting a timed urine spec- imen should be explained carefully so that the parent or patient understands fully the rationale of (1) first emptying the bladder (discarding that urine) and noting the time; and (2) putting all urine subsequently voided into the collection receptacle, including the last void, 12 or 24 hours later. Reliability of the 24-hour collection can be checked by measuring the total 24-hour creatinine excretion in the specimen. Total daily creatinine excretion (creatinine index) should be 14–20 mg/kg. Creatinine indices on either side of  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Less invasive measures such as ultrasonography and Doppler studies can demonstrate renal blood flow or thromboses. More specific identification of stenoses of the renal artery is accomplished by magnetic resonance arteriography. RENAL BIOPSY Histologic information is valuable for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Satisfactory evaluation of renal tissue requires examination by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. When a biopsy is anticipated, a pediatric nephrologist should be consulted. In children, percutaneous renal biopsy with a biopsy needle is an acceptable low-risk procedure— avoiding the risks of general anesthesia—when performed by an experienced physician. A surgeon should perform the biopsy procedure if operative exposure of the kidney is necessary, if a risk factor (eg, bleeding disorder) is present, or if a “wedge” biopsy is preferred. "
677,Congenital Anomalies of the Urinary Tract,Gastrointestinal Tract ,1075,"CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  OF THE URINARY TRACT RENAL PARENCHYMAL ANOMALIES About 10% of children have congenital anomalies of the genitourinary tract, which range in severity from asympto- matic to lethal. Some asymptomatic abnormalities may have significant complications. For example, patients with “horse- shoe” kidney (kidneys fused in their lower poles) have a higher incidence of renal calculi. Unilateral agenesis is usu- ally accompanied by compensatory hypertrophy of the con- tralateral kidney and thus should be compatible with normal renal function. Supernumerary and ectopic kidneys are usu- ally of no significance. Abnormal genitourinary development is associated with varying degrees of renal dysgenesis and dysfunction ranging from mild forms to complete renal agenesis. In neonates, bilateral renal agenesis is associated with severe oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, abnor- mal (Potter) facies, and early death. 1. Renal Dysgenesis Renal dysgenesis is a spectrum of anomalies. In simple hypoplasia, which may be unilateral or bilateral, the affected kidneys are smaller than normal. In some forms of dysplasia, immature, undifferentiated renal tissue persists. In some dysplasias, the number of normal nephrons is insufficient to sustain life once the child reaches a critical body size. The lack of renal tissue may not be readily discernible in the newborn period because the infant’s urine production, though poor in concentration, may be adequate in volume. Often, the search for renal insufficiency is initiated only when growth fails or chronic renal failure develops. Other forms of renal dysplasia include oligomeganephro- nia (characterized by the presence of only a few large glomer- uli) and the cystic dysplasias (characterized by the presence of renal cysts). This group includes microcystic disease (congenital nephrosis). A simple cyst within a kidney may be clinically unimportant because it does not predispose to progressive polycystic development. An entire kidney lost to multicystic development with concomitant hypertrophy and normal function of the contralateral side may also be of little clinical consequence. Nonetheless, even a simple cyst could pose problems if it becomes a site for stone formation, infection, or bleeding. 2. Polycystic Kidney Disease Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is increasingly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. In its most severe form the cystic kidneys are nonfunctional in utero, and, there- fore, newborns can have Potter facies and other complica- tions of oligohydramnios. In infancy and childhood, kidney enlargement by cysts may initially be recognized by abdom- inal palpation of renal masses. Hypertension is an early problem. The rate of the progression of renal insufficiency varies, as does growth failure and other complications of chronic renal failure. Two genes (ADPKD1 and ADPKD2) account for 80% and 10% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, respectively. Susceptibility of fam- ily members is detected by gene linkage studies. Renal ultrasound identifies cysts in about 80% of affected children by age 5 years. Children with this diagnosis need close monitoring for the development and treatment of hyperten- sion, and their families should be offered genetic counsel- ing. Management of end-stage renal failure is by dialysis or renal transplantation. 3. Medullary Cystic Disease  (Juvenile Nephronophthisis) Medullary cystic disease is characterized by cysts of varying sizes in the renal medulla with tubular and interstitial nephritis. Children present with renal failure and signs of tubular dysfunction (decreased concentrating ability, Fan- coni syndrome). This lesion should not be confused with medullary sponge kidney (renal tubular ectasia), a frequently asymptomatic disease occurring in adults. DISTAL URINARY TRACT ANOMALIES 1. Obstructive Uropathy Obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction may be the result of intrinsic muscle abnormalities, aberrant vessels, or fibrous bands. The lesion can cause hydronephrosis and usually presents as an abdominal mass in the newborn. Obstruction    CHAPTER 22 656 can occur in other parts of the ureter, especially at its entrance into the bladder, causing proximal hydroureter and hydronephrosis. Renal radionuclide scan with furosemide “wash-out” will reveal or rule out obstruction as the cause of the hydronephrosis. Whether intrinsic or extrinsic, urinary tract obstruction should be relieved surgically as soon as possible to minimize damage to the kidneys. Severe bladder malformations such as exstrophy are clin- ically obvious and a surgical challenge. More subtle—but urgent in terms of diagnosis—is obstruction of urine flow from vestigial posterior urethral valves. This anomaly, which occurs almost exclusively in males, usually presents in new- borns with anuria or a poor voiding stream secondary to severe obstruction of urine flow. The kidneys and bladder may be easily palpable. Leakage proximal to the obstruction may produce urinary ascites. Surgical drainage of urine is urgently required to prevent irreversible damage. Prune belly syndrome is an association of urinary tract anomalies with cryptorchidism and absent abdominal musculature. Although complex anomalies, especially renal dysplasia, usually cause early death or the need for dialysis or transplantation, some patients have lived into the third decade with varying degrees of renal insuffi- ciency. Timely urinary diversion is essential to sustain renal function. Other complex malformations and external genital anomalies such as hypospadias are beyond the scope of this text. The challenge presented by urologic abnormalities resulting in severe compromise and destruction of renal tissue is to preserve all remaining renal function and treat the complications of progressive chronic renal failure. Involve- ment of a specialist in pediatric urology in early management is essential. 2. Reflux Nephropathy The retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureter (vesicoureteral reflux), may cause renal scarring and subse- quent renal insufficiency or hypertension, or both, especially in the presence of urinary tract infection. A finding of hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound is suggestive of vesi- coureteral reflux. Its presence can be confirmed or elimi- nated by a voiding cystourethrogram, which would also be obtained to rule out reflux in the evaluation of urinary tract infection. Low-grade reflux may resolve in the absence of infection, in which case antibiotic prophylaxis is undertaken while awaiting signs of resolution. Surgery may be required for chronic severe reflux.

678,Hematuria & Glomerular Disease,Gastrointestinal Tract ,2962,"HEMATURIA & GLOMERULAR DISEASE MICROHEMATURIA Children with painful hematuria should be investigated for urinary tract infection or direct injury to the urinary tract. Dysuria is common in cystitis or urethritis; associated back pain suggests the possibility of pyelonephritis; colicky flank pain may indicate the passage of a stone. Bright red blood or clots in the urine are associated with bleeding disorders, trauma, and arteriovenous malformations. Abdominal masses suggest the presence of urinary tract obstruction, cystic dis- ease, or tumors of the renal or perirenal structures. Asymptomatic hematuria is a challenge because clinical and diagnostic data are required to decide whether to refer the child to a nephrologist. The diagnosis of hematuria should not rely solely on a urine “dipstick” evaluation, but should be verified by a microscopic RBC count. Ruling out hypercalciuria as a cause of hematuria by a random urine calcium/creatinine ratio is one of the initial steps in the evaluation of hematuria. A value above 0.2 requires verifica- tion with a 24-hour collection. Hypercalciuria is excretion of calcium in excess of 4 mg/kg/d. Figure 22–1 delineates the outpatient approach to renal hematuria. The concern regarding the differential diagnosis is the possible presence of glomerular disease. GLOMERULONEPHRITIS The various types of GN have similar manifestations. Table 22–1 lists the most commonly encountered disorders in the differential diagnosis of childhood GN, including their clin- ical and histopathologic abnormalities. Severe glomerular histopathologic and clinical entities, such as anti-GBM anti- body disease (Goodpasture syndrome), Wegener granulo- matosis, and idiopathic, rapidly progressive GN, may be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute GN, but these disorders are exceedingly rare in children. 1. Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis The diagnosis of poststreptococcal disease is supported by a recent history (7–14 days previously) of group A β- hemolytic streptococcal infection. If a positive culture is not available, recent infection may be supported by an elevated antistreptolysin O titer or by high titers of other antistrepto- coccal antibodies. Other infections can cause similar glomer- ular injury; thus, “postinfection” glomerulonephritis (GN) may be a better term for this type of acute GN. In most cases, recovery is expected and usually complete within weeks. If the diagnosis is in question, or if the renal function of a patient with postinfection GN progressively deteriorates, a renal biopsy should be performed. The clinical presentation of GN is usually gross hema- turia. Urine may be coffee-colored or tea-colored. Micro- scopic examination of urine reveals RBCs too numerous to    CHAPTER 22 658 diagnosis of IgA nephropathy may be entertained. In con- trast to postinfection GN, IgA nephropathy is not associated with prior streptococcal infection, complement is not depressed, and in 50% of cases, serum immunoglobin A is elevated. Often there are no associated symptoms or signs. Gross hematuria resolves within days, and there are no serious sequelae in 85% of cases. Treatment is not indicated, and the prognosis is good in most cases. Prognosis is guarded, however, if severe proteinuria, hypertension, or renal insufficiency is present or develops. In such instances, although no treatment is universally accepted, corticoster- oids and other immunosuppressive drugs are used. Omega- 3 fatty acids from fish oils are thought to be helpful. 3. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura The diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura rests on the presence of a typical maculopapular rash found primarily, but not exclusively, on the dorsal surfaces of the lower extremities and buttocks. Most children have abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Joint pain is common, and, depending on the extent of renal involvement, hypertension may be present. Joint and abdominal pain responds to treatment with corticosteroids. Renal involvement ranges from mild GN with microhematuria to severe GN and varying degrees of renal insufficiency. GN with massive proteinuria and renal insufficiency carries a poor prognosis. Twenty percent of such cases result in end-stage renal failure. There is no universally accepted treatment, but corticoster- oids are often administered (see Chapter 28). 4. Membranoproliferative  Glomerulonephritis The most common “chronic” form of GN in childhood is membranoproliferative GN. The diagnosis is established from the histologic appearance of the glomeruli on biopsy tissue. There are two major histologic types of membrano- proliferative GN. Clinically, type II carries the worse progno- sis, as end-stage renal failure develops in most cases. Type I more often responds to treatment with corticosteroids. C3 is depressed (in both types) and may be useful as a marker of response to treatment. 5. Lupus Glomerulonephritis The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is based on its numerous clinical features and abnormal laboratory findings that include a positive antinuclear antibody test, depressed serum complement, and increased serum double-stranded DNA. Renal involvement is indicated by varying degrees of hematuria and proteinuria. More severe cases are accompa- nied by renal insufficiency and hypertension. Significant renal involvement requires treatment with immunosuppres- sive drugs and close monitoring. End-stage renal failure develops in 10–15% of patients with childhood SLE. 6. Hereditary Glomerulonephritis The most commonly encountered hereditary glomerulone- phritis is Alport syndrome, characterized by hearing loss and GN, occurring predominantly in males. It is a chronic form of GN and thus does not present with the clinical features typically seen in patients with acute processes. A family history is generally present, but there is a spontane- ous mutation rate of about 18%. In individuals with the progressive form of GN, end-stage renal failure occurs, usually in the second to third decade of life. Although currently there is no treatment for this disorder, careful management of associated hypertension may slow the process. ACUTE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS Acute interstitial nephritis is characterized by diffuse or focal inflammation and edema of the renal interstitium and sec- ondary involvement of the tubules. The condition is most commonly drug related (eg, β-lactam–containing antibi- otics, such as methicillin). Fever, rigor, abdominal or flank pain, and rashes may occur in drug-associated cases. Urinalysis usually reveals leukocyturia and hematuria. Hansel staining of the urinary sediment often demonstrates eosinophils. The inflammation can cause significant deterioration of renal function. If the diagnosis is unclear because of the absence of a history of drug or toxin exposure or the absence of eosinophils in the urine, a renal biopsy may be performed to demonstrate the characteristic tubular and interstitial inflammation. Imme- diate identification and removal of the causative agent is imperative and may be all that is necessary. Treatment with corticosteroids is helpful in patients with progressive renal insufficiency or nephrotic syndrome. Severe renal failure requires supportive dialysis.

680,Proteinuria & Renal Disease,Gastrointestinal Tract ,4772,"PROTEINURIA & RENAL DISEASE Urine is rarely completely protein-free, but the average excretion is well below 150 mg/24 h. Small increases in urinary protein can accompany febrile illnesses or exertion and in some cases occur while in the upright posture. An algorithm for investigation of isolated proteinuria is presented in Figure 22–2. In idiopathic nephrotic syndrome without associated features of GN, treatment with cortico- steroids may be initiated. Nephrologic advice or follow-up should be sought, especially in patients with difficult or frequently relapsing unexplained proteinuria.    CHAPTER 22 660 which shows normal-appearing glomeruli as well as some partially or completely sclerosed glomeruli. The lesion has serious prognostic implications because as many as 15–20% of cases can progress to end-stage renal failure. The response to corticosteroid treatment is variable. In difficult cases, cyclosporin A or tacrolimus have been used in addition to corticosteroids. There are increasing reports that poorly responsive cases may respond to rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD20. Recur- rence of focal glomerular sclerosis may occur after renal transplantation. The recurrence is usually treated with plas- mapheresis or rituximab (this drug is finding encouraging utility in membranous or mesangial nephropathy as well as minimal change disease). MESANGIAL NEPHROPATHY  (MESANGIAL GLOMERULONEPHRITIS) Mesangial nephropathy is another form of corticosteroid- resistant nephrotic syndrome. The renal biopsy shows a distinct increase in the mesangial matrix of the glomeruli. Very often the expanded mesangium contains deposits of IgM demonstrable on immunofluorescent staining. The cause is unknown. Corticosteroid therapy may induce remis- sion, but relapses are common. Choices for treating this type of nephrotic syndrome are the same as noted earlier. MEMBRANOUS NEPHROPATHY  (MEMBRANOUS GLOMERULONEPHRITIS) Although largely idiopathic in nature, membranous ne- phropathy can be found in association with hepatitis B antigenemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, congenital and secondary syphilis, renal vein thrombosis; with immunologic disorders such as autoimmune thyroiditis; and with admin- istration of drugs such as penicillamine. The pathogenesis is unknown, but the glomerular lesion is thought to be the result of prolonged deposition of circulating antigen–anti- body complexes. The onset of membranous nephropathy may be insidious or may resemble that of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood (see earlier section). It occurs more often in older children and adults. The proteinuria of membranous nephropathy responds poorly to corticosteroid therapy, although low-dose corticosteroid therapy may reduce or delay development of chronic renal insufficiency. The diag- nosis is made by renal biopsy. Fine RN: Recurrence of nephrotic syndrome/focal segmental glomerulosclerosis following renal transplantation in children.

682,Diseases of the Renal Vessels,Liver & Pancreas ,2706,"DISEASES OF THE RENAL VESSELS RENAL VEIN THROMBOSIS In newborns, renal vein thrombosis may complicate sepsis or dehydration. It may be observed in infants of diabetic moth- ers; may be associated with umbilical vein catheterization; or may result from any condition that produces a hypercoagula- ble state (eg, clotting factor deficiency, systemic lupus erythe- matosus, or thrombocytosis). Renal vein thrombosis is less common in older children and adolescents. It may develop following trauma or without any apparent predisposing fac- tors. Spontaneous renal vein thrombosis has been associated with membranous glomerulonephropathy. Nephrotic syn- drome may either cause or result from renal vein thrombosis.  Clinical Findings Renal vein thrombosis in newborns is generally characterized by the sudden development of an abdominal mass. If the thrombo- sis is bilateral, oliguria may be present; urine output may be normal with a unilateral thrombus. In older children, flank pain, sometimes with a palpable mass, is a common presentation. No single laboratory test is diagnostic of renal vein throm- bosis. Hematuria usually is present; proteinuria is less constant. In the newborn, thrombocytopenia may be found, but it is rare in older children. The diagnosis is made by ultrasonography and Doppler flow studies.  Treatment Anticoagulation with heparin is the treatment of choice in new- borns and older children. In the newborn, a course of heparin combined with treatment of the underlying problem is usually all that is required. Management in other cases is less straight- forward. The tendency for recurrence and embolization has led some to recommend long-term anticoagulation. If an underlying membranous GN is suspected, biopsy should be performed.  Course & Prognosis The mortality rate in newborns from renal vein thrombosis depends on the underlying cause. With unilateral thromboses, the prognosis for adequate renal function is good. Renal vein thrombosis may rarely recur in the same kidney or occur in the other kidney years after the original episode of thrombus formation. Extension into the vena cava with pulmonary emboli is possible. RENAL ARTERIAL DISEASE Arterial disease (eg, fibromuscular hyperplasia, congenital stenosis) is a rare cause of hypertension in children. Although few clinical clues are specific to underlying arterial lesions, they should be suspected in children with severe hypertension, with onset at or before age 10 years, or with delayed visualization on nuclear scan of the kidneys. The    KIDNEY & URINARY TRACT 661 diagnosis is established by renal arteriography with selective renal vein renin measurements. Some of these lesions may be approached by transluminal angioplasty or surgery (see section on Hypertension, later), but repair may be techni- cally impossible in small children. Although thrombosis of renal arteries is rare, it should be considered in a patient with acute onset of hypertension and hematuria in an appropriate setting (eg, in association with hyperviscosity or umbilical artery catheterization). Early diagnosis and treatment pro- vides the best chance of reestablishing renal blood flow. HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is the most common glomerular vascular cause of acute "
683,Renal Failure,Liver & Pancreas ,736,"renal failure in childhood. It is usually the result of infection with Shigatoxin-producing (also called verotoxin-producing) strains of Shigella or Escherichia coli. Ingestion of undercooked ground beef or unpasteurized foods is a common source. There are many serotypes, but the most common pathogen in the United States is E coli O157:H7. Bloody diarrhea is the usual presenting complaint, followed by hemolysis and renal failure. Circulating verotoxin causes endothelial damage, which leads to platelet deposition, microvascular occlusion with subsequent hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia. Similar microvascular endothelial activa- tion may also be triggered by drugs (eg, cyclosporin A); by viruses (HIV); and by pneumococcal infections, in which bacterial neuraminidase exposes the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen on RBCs, platelets, and endothelial cells, thereby causing platelet aggregation, endothelial damage, and hemol- ysis. Rare cases are caused by genetic factors (eg, congenitally depressed C3 complement and factor H deficiency).  Clinical Findings The epidemic form begins with a prodrome of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Oliguria, pallor, and bleeding manifestations, principally gastrointestinal, occur next. Hypertension and seizures develop in some children—espe- cially those who develop severe renal failure and fluid over- load. There may also be significant endothelial involvement in the central nervous system (CNS). Anemia is profound, and RBC fragments are seen on blood smears. A high reticulocyte count confirms the hemolytic nature of the anemia, but may not be noted in the presence of renal failure. Thrombocytopenia is profound, but other coag- ulation abnormalities are less consistent. Serum fibrin split products are often present, but fulminant disseminated intra- vascular coagulation is rare. Hematuria and proteinuria are often present. The serum complement level is normal except in those cases related to congenital predisposition.  Complications These usually result from renal failure. Neurologic problems, particularly seizures, may result from hyponatremia, hyper- tension, or CNS vascular disease. Severe bleeding, transfu- sion requirements, and hospital-acquired infections must be anticipated.  Treatment Meticulous attention to fluid and electrolyte status is crucial. The use of antimotility agents and antibiotics is believed to worsen the disease. Antibiotics may up-regulate and cause the release of large amounts of bacterial Shiga toxin. Timely dialy- sis improves the prognosis. Since prostacyclin-stimulating fac- tor, a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, may be absent in some cases, plasma infusion or plasmapheresis has been advo- cated in severe cases (generally in those cases with severe CNS involvement). Platelet inhibitors have also been tried, but the results have not been impressive, especially late in the disease. Nonetheless, using a platelet inhibitor early in the disease in an attempt to halt platelet consumption and microvascular occlu- sion may obviate the need for platelet transfusions and reduce the progression of renal failure. RBC and platelet transfusions may be necessary. Although the risk of volume overload is significant, this can be minimized by dialysis. Erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) treatment may reduce RBC transfusion needs. Although no therapy is universally accepted, strict control of hypertension, adequate nutrition support, and the timely use of dialysis reduce morbidity and mortality. If renal failure is “nonoliguric,” and if urine output is sufficient to ensure against fluid overload and electrolyte abnormalities, management of renal failure without dialysis is possible.  Course & Prognosis Most commonly, children recover from the acute episode within 2–3 weeks. Some residual renal disease (including hypertension) occurs in about 30%, and end-stage renal failure occurs in about 15%. Thus follow-up of children recovering from hemolytic-uremic syndrome should include serial determinations of renal function for 1–2 years and monitoring of blood pressure for 5 years. Mortality (about 3–5%) is most likely in the early phase, primarily resulting from CNS or cardiac complications.

689,Inherited or Developmental Defects of the Kidney,Liver & Pancreas ,1001,"INHERITED OR DEVELOPMENTAL  DEFECTS OF THE KIDNEY There are many developmental, hereditary, or metabolic defects of the kidneys and collecting system. The clinical consequences include metabolic abnormalities, failure to thrive, nephrolithia- sis, renal glomerular or tubular dysfunction, and chronic renal failure. Table 22–6 lists some of the major entities; discussion of the rarer conditions is beyond the scope of this book. DISORDERS OF THE RENAL TUBULES Three subtypes of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) are recog- nized: (1) the classic form, called type I or distal RTA; (2) the bicarbonate-wasting form, called type II or proximal RTA; and (3) type IV, or hyperkalemic RTA (rare in children), which is associated with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. Type I and type II and their variants are encountered most frequently in children. Type III is a combination of types I and II. Primary tubular disorders in childhood, such as glycin- uria, hypouricemia, or renal glycosuria, may result from a defect in a single tubular transport pathway (see Table 22–6). 1. Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (Type I) The most common form of distal RTA in childhood is the hereditary form. The clinical presentation is one of failure to thrive, anorexia, vomiting, and dehydration. Hyperchlor- emic metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and a urinary pH exceeding 6.5 is found. Acidosis is more severe in the presence of a bicarbonate “leak.” This variant of distal RTA with bicarbonate wasting has been called type III but for clinical purposes need not be considered as a distinct entity. Concomitant hypercalciuria may lead to rickets, nephrocal- cinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal failure. Other situations that may be responsible for distal RTA are found in some of the entities listed in Table 22–6. Table 22–4. Antihypertensive  drugs for emergent treatment.

695,Neurologic Assessment & Neurodiagnostic  Procedures,Liver & Pancreas ,124,"NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT &  NEURODIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES HISTORY & EXAMINATION A general physical examination (albeit sometimes truncated) and an age-appropriate developmental assessment are part of every neurologic visit. Information provided in several earlier chapters is relevant in this context. Chapter 2 delineates age- appropriate developmental landmarks (see Tables 2–1 and 2–2); the Denver II schedule (see Figure 2–12) is helpful, especially in infancy. Growth and head circumference charts (you should measure the head) are also included in Chapter 2. Details of the standard pediatric history and physical examina- tion are presented in Chapter 8. Expected newborn-infant reflexes and automations and other examination suggestions pertinent to that age group are included in Chapter 1. Table 23–1 outlines components of the neurologic exam- ination. Examination of a frightened or wary infant can begin on the mother’s lap. Playing games will engage a toddler or preschooler: retrieving, casting a ball, stacking blocks, hop- ping, jogging, counting, and drawing (circles, lines) can reduce anxiety and exhibit fine and gross motor coordina- tion, balance, and handedness. On occasion beyond pre- school age, describing a picture, drawing, writing, calculat- ing, and spelling will aid in assessing speech and intelligence. Emphasis (or fine tuning) of both history and physical ex- amination strongly depends on the chief complaint. Insidious developmental delay or weakness might demand detailed explo- ration of pregnancy, family, and social history; developmental landmarks; and general physical, motor, and speech achieve- ments. Headaches or seizures in an older child warrant more emphasis on precise details preceding and during these events. LUMBAR PUNCTURE Spinal fluid is usually obtained by inserting a small-gauge needle (eg, No. 22) through the L3–L4 intervertebral space into the thecal sac while the patient is lying on his or her side. After an opening pressure is measured, a small amount of fluid is removed most frequently to examine for evidence of infection or inflammation (Table 23–2). Fluid is sent for red and white cell counts, for determination of the concentra- tions of protein and glucose, and for viral and bacterial cultures. In some cases, additional information is obtained with special staining techniques for mycobacteria and fun- gus. Additional fluid may be sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for specific viral agents, antibody titer determinations, cytopathologic study, lactate and pyruvate concentrations, and amino acid and neurotransmitter analy- sis. Lumbar puncture is imperative when bacterial meningitis is suspected. Caution must be exercised, however, when signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema) or focal neurologic signs are present that might indicate a substantial risk of precipitating tentorial or tonsillar herniation. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY Electroencephalography (EEG), a widely used noninvasive electrophysiologic method for recording cerebral activity, has its greatest clinical applicability in the study of seizure disorders. EEG is particularly helpful in showing epilepti- form activity. Sometimes the findings are diagnostic, as in the hypsarrhythmia EEG of infantile spasms or the pro- longed generalized 3/s spike-wave of absence seizures. EEG is also used in the evaluation of tumors, cerebrovas- cular accidents, neurodegenerative diseases, and other neu- rologic disorders causing brain dysfunction. Recordings over a 24-hour period or all-night recordings are invaluable in the diagnosis of sleep disturbances and narcolepsy. EEG with telemetry or simultaneous monitoring of behavior on video- tape has great usefulness in selected cases. The EEG can be helpful in determining a possible cause or mechanism of coma and whether subclinical seizures are contributing to the coma, and can help determine whether coma is irrevers- ible and brain death has occurred.  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use.    NEUROLOGIC & MUSCULAR DISORDERS 679 scanners are usually used, permitting excellent detail in the coronal and sagittal planes. Contiguous structures can be studied by a continuous sweep and reviewed on videotape. Ultrasonography has been used for in-utero diagnosis of hydrocephalus and other anomalies. In neonates, the thin skull and the open anterior fontanelle have facilitated imaging of the brain, and ultrasonography is used to screen and follow infants of less than 32 weeks’ gestation or weighing less than 1500 g for intracranial hemorrhage. Other uses in neonates include detection of hydrocephalus, major brain and spine malformations, and calcifications from intrauterine infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Toxoplasma. In skilled hands, sonography of the neonatal spine can be used as a screening test for anomalies at the lumbosacral level. Cerebral Angiography Arteriography remains a useful procedure in the diagnosis of many cerebrovascular disorders, particularly in cere- brovascular accidents or in potentially operable vascular malformations. In some brain tumors, arteriography may be necessary to define the precise location or vascular bed, to differentiate among tumors, or to distinguish tumor from abscess or infarction. Noninvasive CT, MRI, and MRA scans can diagnose many cases of static or flowing blood disorders (eg, sinus thromboses). If necessary, the more risky invasive arteriography is usually done via femoral artery-aorta catheterization. Myelography Radiographic examination of the spine may be indicated in cases of spinal cord tumors, myelitis, or various forms of spinal dysraphism and in the rare instance of herniated disks in children. MRI has largely replaced sonography, CT, and myelography for examination of the spinal cord.

701,Disorders Affecting the Nervous System  in Infants & Children,Liver & Pancreas ,3550,"DISORDERS AFFECTING THE NERVOUS  SYSTEM IN INFANTS & CHILDREN ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Reduction or alteration in cognitive and affective men- tal functioning and in arousability or attentiveness.  Acute onset.  General Considerations Many terms are used to describe the continuum from full alertness to complete unresponsiveness and deep coma, including clouding, obtundation, somnolence or stupor, semicoma or light coma, and deep coma. Several scales have been used to grade the depth of unconsciousness (Table 23–3). The commonly used Glasgow Coma Scale is summarized in Table 11–5. Physicians should use one of these tables and provide further descriptions in case narratives. These descrip- tions help subsequent observers quantify unconsciousness and evaluate changes in the patient’s condition. The neurologic substrate for consciousness is the retic- ular activating system in the brainstem, up to and includ- ing the thalamus and paraventricular hypothalamus. Large lesions of the cortex, especially of the left hemi- sphere, can also cause coma. The term locked-in syndrome describes patients who are conscious but have no access to motor or verbal expression because of massive loss of motor function of the brainstem. Coma vigil refers to patients who seem comatose but have some spontaneous motor behavior, such as eye opening or eye tracking, almost always at a reflex level. Persistent vegetative state denotes a chronic condition in which there is preservation of the sleep-wake cycle but no awareness and no recovery of mental function.  Treatment A. Emergency Measures The clinician’s first response is to ensure that the patient will survive. The ABCs of resuscitation are pertinent. The airway must be kept open with positioning or even endotracheal    CHAPTER 23 728 over a lifetime. Helpful medications (rarely needed long- term) include propranolol or primidone. Differential diagnosis includes birth asphyxia, Wilson disease, hyperthyroidism, and hypocalcemia; history and laboratory tests rule out these rare possibilities. Recent research studies in adults utilizing proton MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) suggest decreased nerve cells in the cerebellar cortex and increased harmane, a neuro- toxin, at the same site. The latter suggests a possible environ- mental contribution to essential tremor. Deng H et al: Genetics of essential tremor. Brain 2007;130:1456 [PMID: 17353225].

750,Infections & Inflammatory Disorders of the  Central Nervous System,Liver & Pancreas ,1080,"INFECTIONS & INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS  OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM Infections of the CNS are among the most common neuro- logic disorders encountered by pediatricians. Although infections are among the CNS disorders most amenable to treatment, they also have a very high potential for causing catastrophic destruction of the nervous system. It is impera- tive for the clinician to recognize infections early in order to treat and prevent massive tissue destruction.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Patients with CNS infections, whether caused by bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms, present with similar man- ifestations. Systemic signs of infection include fever; malaise; and impaired heart, lung, liver, or kidney function. General features suggesting CNS infection include headache, stiff neck, fever or hypothermia, changes in mental status (including hyperirritability evolving into lethargy and coma), seizures, and focal sensory and motor deficits. Meningeal irritation is manifested by the presence of Kernig and Brudzinski signs. In very young infants, signs of meningeal irritation may be absent, and temperature instability and hypothermia are often more prominent than fever. In young infants, a bulging fontanelle and an increased head circumference are com- mon. Papilledema may eventually develop, particularly in older children and adolescents. Cranial nerve palsies may develop acutely or gradually during the course of neurologic infections. No specific clinical sign or symptom is reliable in distinguishing bacterial infections from infections caused by other microbes. During the initial clinical assessment, conditions that predispose the patient to infection of the CNS should be sought. Infections involving the sinuses or other structures in the head and neck region can result in direct extension of infection into the intracranial compartment. Open head injuries, recent neurosurgical procedures, immunodefi- ciency, and the presence of a mechanical shunt may predis- pose to intracranial infection. B. Laboratory Findings When CNS infections are suspected, blood should be obtained for a complete blood count, general chemistry panel, and cul- ture. Most important, however, is obtaining CSF. In the absence of focal neurologic deficits or signs of brainstem herniation, CSF should be obtained immediately from any patient in whom serious CNS infection is suspected. When papilledema or focal motor signs are present, a lumbar puncture may be delayed until a neuroimaging procedure has been done to exclude space- occupying lesions. Treatment must be started even if lumbar puncture is delayed. It is generally safe to obtain spinal fluid from infants with nonfocal neurologic examination even if the fontanelle is bulging. Spinal fluid should be examined for the presence of red and white blood cells, protein concentration, glucose concentration, bacteria, and other microorganisms; a sample should be cultured. In addition, serologic, immuno- logic, and nucleic acid detection (PCR) tests may be performed on the spinal fluid in an attempt to identify the specific organ- ism. Spinal fluid that contains a high proportion of polymor- phonuclear leukocytes, a high protein concentration, and a low glucose concentration strongly suggests bacterial infection (see Chapter 40). CSF containing predominantly lymphocytes, a high protein concentration, and a low glucose concentration suggests infection with mycobacteria, fungi, uncommon bacte- ria, and some viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, herpes simplex virus, mumps virus, and arboviruses (see Chapters 38 and 41). CSF that contains a high proportion of lymphocytes, normal or only slightly elevated protein concen- tration, and a normal glucose concentration is most suggestive of viral infections, although partially treated bacterial meningitis and parameningeal infections may also result in this type of CSF formula. Typical CSF findings in a variety of infectious and inflammatory disorders are shown in Table 23–2. In some cases, brain biopsy may be needed to identify the presence of specific organisms and clarify the diagnosis. Her- pes simplex virus infections can be confirmed using the PCR test to assay for herpes DNA in spinal fluid. This test has 95% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Brain biopsy may be needed to detect the rare PCR-negative case of herpes simplex and various parasitic infections, or in a suspected noninfectious cause with ambiguous spinal fluid findings (eg, vasculitis).

758,Disorders of Childhood Affecting Muscles,Liver & Pancreas ,1523,"DISORDERS OF CHILDHOOD  AFFECTING MUSCLES (TABLE 23–25) DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Serum Enzymes Creatine kinase reflects muscle damage or “leaks” from muscle into plasma. Blood should be drawn before EMG or muscle biopsy, which may lead to release of the enzyme. Corticosteroids may suppress levels despite very active mus- cle disease, for example, as in polymyositis. Electromyography Electromyography is often helpful in grossly differentiating myopathic from neurogenic processes. Fibrillations occur in both. In the myopathies, very low spikes are more typical, and the motor unit action potentials seen during contraction characteristically are of short duration, are polyphasic, and are increased in number for the strength of the contraction (increased interference pattern). Neurogenic findings include decreased numbers of motor units, which may be polyphasic, larger than normal, or both. The interference pattern is decreased. In myotonic dystrophy, the EMG is characterized by prolonged discharge of electrical activity on movement of the probing needle (so-called “dive-bomber” sound). Muscle Biopsy Properly executed (by open biopsy or by using the Berg- strom muscle biopsy needle), this procedure is usually help- ful. Histochemical techniques, histogram analysis of muscle fiber types and sizes, and electron microscopy are offering new classifications of the myopathies. Findings common to the muscular dystrophies include variation in the size and shape of muscle fibers, increase in connective tissue, intersti- tial infiltration of fatty tissue, degenerative changes in muscle fibers, and central location of nuclei. Dystrophin is a normal intracellular plasma membrane protein in muscle, the gene product missing in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. Staining the muscle for dystrophin aids in differentiating Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies; dystrophin is absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and reduced in Becker muscular dys- trophy. Electrophoresis can confirm whether the dystro- phin is absent or present in small amounts and whether there is a qualitative difference from normal dystrophin, the latter two patterns being characteristic of Becker mus- cular dystrophy. Genetic Testing & Carrier Detection Previously, detection of carriers for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mothers and sisters of affected boys) rested on creatine kinase elevations (two thirds of patients will have this finding); physical findings of mild dystrophy (large calves and muscle weakness); abnormal muscle EMGs; or biopsy results. All are unreliable for diagnostic purposes. DNA probes are now available for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of Duchenne and Becker muscular dys- trophies. Deletions are often (60%) found on the short arm of the X chromosome; it is postulated that all patients and most mothers will show deletions when sufficient probes are developed to search the whole Duchenne genome (perhaps 4000 kb in length). Amplification of DNA by the PCR test can detect the deletion. Moreover, this technique plus Southern blot analy- sis can detect abnormal DNA base repeats. For example, in myotonic dystrophy, a GCT triplet excess is currently the most sensitive test for that disease. The tests can be used for intrauterine diagnosis and prediction of whether the triplet is within the normal or mutant range. Thus, in many cases, the greater the number of repeats, the more severely involved the fetus or patient. Mutations (especially deletions) of survivor motor neu- ron and neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein genes on chromosome 5q13 are present in 95% of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is the most common cause of inherited neonatal death, occurring in 1 in 10,000 live births. Finally, Kearns-Sayre progressive external ophthalmople- gia with retinopathy is inherited via maternal cytoplasmic mitochondria. Assay of mutations and deletions from blood or muscle samples are now commercially available.    750 24 Orthopedics John D. Polousky, MD Robert E. Eilert, MD Orthopedics is the medical discipline that deals with disor- ders of the neuromuscular and skeletal systems. The most common complaints in orthopedics are pain, loss of func- tion, and deformity. Although the medical history reveals the patient’s expectations, the physical examination and radio- graphic imaging are the most important tools of orthopedic diagnosis. "
772,Disturbances of Prenatal Origin,Liver & Pancreas ,430,"DISTURBANCES OF PRENATAL ORIGIN CONGENITAL AMPUTATIONS  & LIMB DEFICIENCIES  General Considerations Congenital amputations are caused by teratogens (eg, drugs or viruses), amniotic bands, or metabolic diseases (eg, diabe- tes in the mother). Children with congenital limb deficien- cies, such as absence of the femur, tibia, or fibula, also have a high incidence of associated congenital anomalies, includ- ing genitourinary and cardiac defects and cleft palate. A limb deficiency usually consists of partial absence of structures in the extremity along one side or the other. The effect on structures distal to the amputation varies. For example, in radial club hand, the entire radius is absent, while the thumb may be hypoplastic or absent. Longitudinal bone deficiency is almost always associated with complex tissue defects in the extremity because of abnormalities of the associated nerves and muscles.  Treatment Mild limb deficiencies can be treated with limb lengthening or contralateral limb shortening, or both. More severe defi- ciencies are treated with prostheses to compensate for the length discrepancy. For some severe anomalies, surgery to remove a portion of the malformed extremity (eg, foot) is indicated so that a prosthesis can be fitted early. Lower extremity prostheses are best fitted between ages 12 and 15 months, when walking starts. They are consistently well accepted, because they are necessary for balance and walking. In unilateral upper extremity amputation, fitting the child with a dummy-type prosthesis as early as age 6 months is advantageous because the child becomes accus- tomed to an extremity of the proper length and to the habit of bimanual manipulation. Children quickly learn how to function with a prosthesis and can lead active lives, even participating in sports. Although myoelectric prostheses have a technologic appeal, most patients find that simpler constructs are more useful in the long run. Fixsen JA: Major lower limb shortening: A mini review.

Metatarsus Varus Metatarsus varus is a common congenital foot deformity characterized by inward deviation of the forefoot. A vertical crease in the arch is present in rigid deformities. The angula- tion is located at the base of the fifth metatarsal, and this bone is prominent. Most flexible deformities are secondary to intrauterine positioning pressure and usually resolve spontaneously. Ten to 15% of children with metatarsus varus also have hip dysplasia. A careful hip examination is mandatory. If the deformity is rigid and cannot be manipu- lated past the midline, it is worthwhile to use a cast changed at intervals of 2 weeks to correct the deformity. So-called corrective shoes do not live up to their name, although they can be used to maintain correction obtained by casting. Lincoln TL, Suen PW: Common rotational variations in children.

Intel- ligence and sexual function are normal. The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, but 80% of cases result from new mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) gene. Radiographs demonstrate short, thick tubular bones and irregular epiphysial plates. The ends of the bones are thick, with broadening and cupping. Epiphysial ossification may be delayed. Because the spinal canal is narrowed, a herniated disk in adulthood may lead to acute paraplegia. Growth hormone is given to some children with bone dysplasia.

The child generally appears normal at birth and begins to develop deformities between ages 1 and 4 years as a result of abnormal deposition of mucopolysaccharides. Radiographs demonstrate wedge-shaped flattened verte- brae and irregular, malformed epiphyses. The ribs are broad and have been likened to canoe paddles. The lower extremi- ties are more severely involved than the upper ones. The major treatment issue revolves around the preven- tion of cervical myelopathy. Bone marrow transplantation has been successful in alleviating some of the symptoms. Krivit W: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of lysosomal and peroxisomal metabolic diseases.

776,Growth Disturbances of the Musculoskeletal  System,Liver & Pancreas ,2100,"GROWTH DISTURBANCES OF  THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM SCOLIOSIS  General Considerations Scoliosis is characterized by lateral curvature of the spine associated with rotation of the involved vertebrae. Scoliosis is classified by its anatomic location—thoracic, lumbar, and rarely, cervical. The convexity of the curve is designated right or left. Thus a right thoracic scoliosis would denote a thoracic curve in which the convexity is to the right, which is the most common type of idiopathic curve. A mild degree of posterior curvature of the spine (kyphosis) is normal in the thoracic area. Excessive curvature is pathologic. Mild anterior curvature of the spine (lordosis) is normal in the lumbar and cervical spines. Idiopathic scoliosis generally begins at age 8 or 10 years and usually progresses during growth. In rare instances, infan- tile scoliosis may be seen in children aged 2 years or younger. Idiopathic scoliosis is four to five times more common in girls than boys. Eighty percent of cases of scoliosis are idiopathic. Because 30% of family members are also affected, siblings of an affected child should be examined. The disor- der is usually asymptomatic in adolescence, but severe curva- ture can cause pain or loss of pulmonary function in later years. The screening examination for scoliosis is performed by having the patient bend forward 90 degrees with the hands joined in the midline. Asymmetry of the height of the ribs or paravertebral muscles on one side indicates the rotation of the trunk associated with lateral curvature. Diseases associated with scoliosis include neurofibroma- tosis, Marfan syndrome, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis, and myelodysplasia. Between 5% and 7% of cases of scoliosis are due to congenital vertebral anomalies such as a hemivertebra or unilateral vertebral bridge. These curves are more rigid than the common idiopathic curve (see later discussion) and often increase with growth, especially during adolescence. Idiopathic infantile scoliosis, occurring in children age 2– 4 years, is uncommon in the United States but more com- mon in Great Britain. If the rib-vertebral angle of Mehta is less than 20 degrees, the curve will resolve spontaneously. If the angle is greater, the curve will progress. Sciatic scoliosis may result from pressure on the spinal cord or roots by infectious processes or herniation of the nucleus pulposus; the underlying cause must be sought. Secondary curvature will resolve as the primary problem is treated.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Scoliosis in adolescents does not cause significant pain. If a patient has significant pain, seek the underlying cause because the scoliosis is usually secondary to another disorder such as bone or spinal cord tumor. Deformity of the rib cage and asymmetry of the waistline are evident with curvatures of 30 degrees or more. Less severe curvature may be detected by the forward bending test described earlier. This test is designed to detect early abnormalities of rotation that may not be apparent when the patient is standing erect. B. Imaging The most valuable radiographs are those taken of the entire spine in the standing position in both the anteroposterior and lateral planes. Usually one primary curvature is evident with a compensatory curvature that develops to balance the    ORTHOPEDICS 757 "

Degenerative arthritis may follow childhood skeletal prob- lems, such as infection, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, avascular necrosis, or trauma, or it may occur in association with hemophilia. Early effective treatment of these disorders can prevent arthritis. Degenerative changes in the soft tissues around joints may occur as a result of overuse syndrome in adolescent athletes. Young boys throwing excessive numbers of pitches, especially curve balls, may develop “Little League” elbow, consisting of degenerative changes around the humeral condyles associated with pain, swelling, and limitation of motion (see Chapter 25). Limitation of the number of pitches thrown by Little League pitchers is the key to prevention. Acute bursitis is uncommon in childhood, and other causes should be ruled out before this diagnosis is accepted. Tenosynovitis is most common in the region of the knees and feet. Children taking dancing lessons, particularly toe dancing, may have pain around the flexor tendon sheaths in the toes or ankles. Rest is effective treatment. At the knee level, the patellar ligament may be irritated, with associated swelling in the infrapatellar fat pad. Synovitis in this area is usually due to overuse and is treated by rest and nonster- oidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroid injections are contraindicated. TRAUMA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Directed physical examination shows swelling, tender- ness, deformity, or instability.  Radiographic findings are consistent with forceful injury.  Rule out physeal fracture. SOFT TISSUE TRAUMA (SPRAINS,  STRAINS, & CONTUSIONS) A sprain is the stretching of a ligament. A strain is a stretch of a muscle or tendon. Contusions are generally due to tissue compression, with damage to blood vessels within the tissue and the formation of hematoma. A severe sprain is one in which the ligament is completely disrupted, resulting in instability of the joint. In a mild or moderate sprain, tearing of the ligament is incomplete, but local pain and swelling results. Mild or moderate sprain is not associated with instability of the joint. The initial treatment of mild or moderate sprain consists of ice, compression, and elevation. Brief splinting followed by early range of motion of the affected joint protects against further injury and relieves swelling and pain. Ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are useful for pain. In more severe trauma with tearing of a ligament, insta- bility of the joint may be demonstrated by gross examination or by stress testing with radiographic documentation. Such deformity of the joint may cause persistent instability result- ing from inaccurate apposition of the ligament ends during healing. If instability is evident, surgical repair of the torn ligament may be indicated. If a muscle is torn at its tendi- nous insertion, it should be repaired. 1. Ankle Sprains The history will indicate that the injury was by either forceful inversion or eversion. The more common inversion injury results in tearing or injury to the lateral ligaments, whereas an eversion injury will injure the medial ligaments of the ankle. The injured ligaments may be identified by means of careful palpation for point tenderness around the ankle. The joint should be supported or immobilized at a right angle, which is the functional position. Use of an air splint produces joint rest, and the extremity can be protected by using crutches. Functional rehabilitation, including edema control, range-of- motion exercises, strengthening, and restitution of proprio- ceptive sensation, can prevent long-term disability. Ivins D: Acute ankle sprain: An update. Am Fam Physician 2006;74:1714 [PMID: 17137000]. 2. Knee Sprains Sprains of the collateral and cruciate ligaments are uncom- mon in children. These ligaments are so strong that it is more common to injure the growth plates, which are the weakest structures in the knees of children. In adolescence, however, the physes have started to close, and the knee joint is more like that of an adult. Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament can result from a rotational injury (see Chapter 25). If the injury produces avulsion of the tibial spine, anatomic reduction and fixation is often required. Effusion of the knee after trauma should be referred to an orthopedic specialist. The differential diagnosis includes torn ligament, torn meniscus, and osteochondral fracture. Non- traumatic effusion should be evaluated for inflammatory conditions (eg, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) or patellar malalignment.     ORTHOPEDICS 757 DEGENERATIVE PROBLEMS (ARTHRITIS,  BURSITIS, & TENOSYNOVITIS) ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Chronic condition.  May result from overuse in adolescent athletes.  Rule out more serious conditions first.

782,Infections of the Bones & Joints,Liver & Pancreas ,17,"INFECTIONS OF THE BONES & JOINTS OSTEOMYELITIS Osteomyelitis is an infectious process that usually starts in the spongy or medullary bone and then extends to involve com- pact or cortical bone. The lower extremities are most often affected, and there is commonly a history of trauma. Osteo- myelitis may occur as a result of direct bacterial invasion through a penetrating wound or open fracture, but hematog- enous spread of infection (eg, pyoderma or upper respiratory tract infection) from other infected areas is much more common. The most common infecting organism is Staphylo- coccus aureus, which has a tendency to infect the metaphyses of growing bones. Anatomically, circulation in the long bones is such that the blood supply to the metaphysis just below the growth plate is provided by end arteries, which turn sharply to end in venous sinusoids, causing a relative stasis. In the infant younger than age 1 year, there is direct vascular communica- tion with the epiphysis across the growth plate, so that direct spread may occur from the metaphysis to the epiphysis and subsequently into the joint. In the older child, the growth plate provides an effective barrier, the epiphysis is usually not involved. In the older child, infection spreads retrograde from the metaphysis into the diaphysis, and by rupture through the cortical bone and along the diaphysis beneath the periosteum. 1. Exogenous Osteomyelitis To avoid osteomyelitis by direct extension, all wounds must be carefully cleansed. Osteomyelitis is a common occurrence from pressure sores in anesthetic areas, as in patients with spina bifida. Cultures of the wound at the time of explora- tion and debridement may be useful if signs of infection develop subsequently. Copious irrigation is necessary, and all nonviable skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle must be excised. In extensive or contaminated wounds, antibiotic coverage is indicated. Contaminated lacerations should be left open and secondary closure performed 3–5 days later. At the time of delayed closure, any remaining necrotic tissue should be excised. Leaving the wound open allows the infection to stay at the surface rather than extend inward to the bone. Puncture wounds are especially liable to cause osteomyelitis and should be carefully debrided. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be adminis- tered, but the final choice of antibiotics is directed by culture results. A tetanus toxoid booster may be indicated. Gas gangrene is best prevented by adequate debridement. After exogenous osteomyelitis has become established, treatment becomes more complicated, requiring extensive surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics. 2. Hematogenous Osteomyelitis Hematogenous osteomyelitis is usually caused by pyogenic bacteria; 85% of cases are due to staphylococci. Streptococci are a less common cause of osteomyelitis. Pseudomonas organisms are common in cases of nail puncture wounds. Children with sickle cell anemia are especially prone to osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella spp.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs In infants, the manifestations of osteomyelitis may be subtle, presenting as irritability, diarrhea, or failure to feed properly; the temperature may be normal or slightly low; and the white blood cell count may be normal or only slightly elevated. There may be pseudoparalysis of the involved limb. In older children, the manifestations are more striking, with local tenderness and pain, high fever, rapid pulse, and elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein. Osteomyelitis of a lower extremity often occurs around the knee joint in children aged 7–10 years. Tenderness is most marked over the metaphysis of the bone where the process originates. Lower extremity osteomyelitis should be ruled out in any child who refuses to bear weight. B. Laboratory Findings Blood cultures are often positive early. The most significant test in infancy is the aspiration of pus. It is useful to needle the bone in the area of suspected infection and aspirate any fluid present. This fluid should be stained for organisms and cultured. Even edema fluid may be useful for determining the causative organism. Elevation of the ESR above 50 mm/h is typical for osteomyelitis. C-reactive protein is elevated earlier than the ESR. C. Imaging Nonspecific local swelling is the first radiographic finding, followed by elevation of the periosteum. Formation of new bone from the cambium layer of the periosteum occurs after 3–6 days. As the infection becomes chronic, areas of cortical bone are isolated by pus spreading down the medullary canal, causing rarefaction and demineralization of the bone. Such isolated pieces of cortex become ischemic and form sequestra (dead bone fragments). These radiographic find- ings are late but specific. Osteomyelitis should be diagnosed clinically before significant radiographic findings are present. Bone scan is sensitive but nonspecific and should be inter- preted in the clinical context before radiographic findings become positive. Magnetic resonance imaging can demon- strate edema early or soft-tissue thickening later.  Treatment A. Specific Measures Antibiotics should be started intravenously as soon as the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is made. Oral antibiotics are begun    CHAPTER 24 762 For staphylococcal infections, 3 weeks of therapy is recom- mended; for other organisms, 2 weeks is usually sufficient. Oral therapy may be begun when clinical signs have improved markedly. It is not necessary to give intra-articular antibiotics, because good levels are achieved in the synovial fluid with parenteral administration.  Prognosis The prognosis for the patient with pyogenic arthritis is excellent if the joint is drained early, before damage to the articular cartilage has occurred. If infection is present for more than 24 hours, dissolution of the proteoglycans in the articular cartilage takes place, with subsequent arthrosis and fibrosis of the joint. Damage to the growth plate may also occur, especially within the hip joint, where the epiphyseal plate is intracapsular. Frank G et al: Musculoskeletal infections in children. Pediatr Clin North Am 2005;52:1083 [PMID: 16009258]. TUBERCULOUS ARTHRITIS Tuberculous arthritis is now a rare disease in the United States, but children in poor social circumstances are at risk for the infection. Generally tuberculous arthritis may be ruled out by negative skin testing. The joints most com- monly affected in children are the intervertebral disks, resulting in gibbus or dorsal angular deformity at the site of involvement. Treatment is by local drainage of the abscess, followed by antituberculous therapy. Prolonged immobiliza- tion in a plaster cast or prolonged bed rest is necessary to promote healing. Spinal fusion may be required to preserve stability of the vertebral column. Mkandawire NC, Kaunda E: Bone and joint TB at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital 1986 to 2002.

TRANSIENT SYNOVITIS OF THE HIP The most common cause of limping and pain in the hip in children in the United States is transitory synovitis, an acute inflammatory reaction that often follows an upper respiratory infection. It is generally self-limited. In questionable cases, aspiration of the hip joint yields only yellowish fluid with low protein and few if any neutrophils. Toxic synovitis of the hip is rarely associated with elevation of the ESR, white blood cell count, or temperature above 38.3°C. It usually affects chil- dren aged 3–10 years and is more common in boys than girls. Motion of the hip joint is limited, particularly internal rota- tion, and radiographic changes are nonspecific, with some swelling apparent in the soft tissues around the joint. Treatment consists of bed rest and mild traction with slight flexion of the hip. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs shorten the course of the disease, although even with no treatment, the disease usually runs its course in days. Follow-up radiographs of the hip are important because toxic synovitis may be the precursor of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in a small percentage of patients. Radio- graphs can be obtained at 6 weeks, or earlier if either a persistent limp or pain is present.

Osteochondrosis due to vascular lesions may affect several growth centers. Table 24–1 indicates the common sites and the typical ages at presentation. Although the pathologic and radiographic features of avascular necrosis of the epiphyses are well known, the cause is not generally agreed upon. Necrosis may follow trauma or infection, but idiopathic lesions are common and often occur during periods of rapid growth of the epiphyses. In contrast to other body tissues that undergo infarction, infarcted bone heals by removal of necrotic tissue replace- ment with living bone in a process called creeping substitu- tion. Replacement of necrotic bone may be so perfect that a completely normal bone results. Adequacy of replacement depends on the patient’s age, the presence or absence of associated infection, the congruity of the involved joint, and other physiologic and mechanical factors. Because of their rapid growth in relation to their blood supply, the secondary ossification centers in the epiphyses are very susceptible to avascular necrosis. Despite the num- ber of different names referring to avascular necrosis of the epiphyses, the process is identical: necrosis of bone followed by replacement (see Table 24–1).    CHAPTER 24 764 be worthwhile to drill the necrotic fragment to encourage more rapid vascular ingrowth and replacement.

The greatest gains from this therapy are obtained during the first few years of life, and therapy should not be continued when no improvement is apparent. Bracing and splinting are of questionable benefit, although night splints may be useful in preventing equinus deformity of the feet or adduction contractures of the hips. Orthopedic surgery is useful for treating joint contractures that interfere with function. In general, muscle transfers are unpredictable in cerebral palsy, and most orthopedic proce- dures are directed at tendon lengthening or bony stabiliza- tion by osteotomy or arthrodesis. Flexion and adduction of the hip due to hyperactivity of the adductors and flexors may produce a progressive para- lytic dislocation of the hip, which can lead to pain and dysfunction. Treatment of this dislocation is difficult and unsatisfactory. The principal preventive measure is abduc- tion bracing, but this must often be supplemented by release of the adductors and hip flexors in order to prevent disloca- tion. In severe cases, osteotomy of the femur may also be necessary to correct the bony deformities of femoral antever- sion and coxa valga that are invariably present. Patients with a predominantly athetotic pattern are poor candidates for any surgical procedure or bracing. Because it is difficult to predict the outcome of surgical procedures in cerebral palsy, the surgeon must examine patients on several occasions before any operative procedure is undertaken. Follow-up care by a physical therapist to maximize the anticipated long-term gains should be arranged before the operation.

ORTHOPEDIC ASPECTS OF MYELODYSPLASIA Patients born with spina bifida cystica (aperta) should be examined early by an orthopedic surgeon. The level of neurologic involvement determines the muscle imbalance that will be present and apt to produce deformity with growth. The involvement is often asymmetrical and tends to change during the first 12–18 months of life. Early closure of the sac is the rule, although there has been some hesitancy to provide treatment to all of these patients because of the extremely poor prognosis associated with congenital hydro- cephalus, high levels of paralysis, and associated congenital anomalies. A high percentage of these children have hydro- cephalus, which may be evident at birth or shortly thereafter, requiring shunting. Associated musculoskeletal problems may include clubfoot, congenital dislocation of the hip, arthrogryposis-type changes of the lower extremities, and congenital scoliosis. The most common lesions are at the level of L3–4 and tend to affect the hip joint, with progressive dislocation occurring during growth. Foot deformities may be in any direction and are complicated by the fact that sensation is generally absent. Spinal deformities develop in a high percentage of these children, with scoliosis present in approximately 40%. Ambulation may require long leg braces. Careful urologic follow-up must be obtained to prevent complications from bladder dysfunction. In children who have a reasonable likelihood of walking, operative treatment consists of reduction of the hip and alignment of the feet in the weight-bearing position as well as stabilization of the scoliosis. In children who lack active quadriceps function and extensor power of the knee, the likelihood of ambulation is greatly decreased. In such patients, aggressive surgery in the hip region may result in stiffening of the joints, thus preventing sitting. Multiple foot operations are also contraindicated in these children. The overall treatment of the child with spina bifida should be coordinated in a multidisciplinary clinic where various medical specialists work with therapists, social work- ers, and teachers to provide the best possible care.

NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS INVOLVING  THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM ORTHOPEDIC ASPECTS OF CEREBRAL PALSY Early physical therapy to encourage completion of the nor- mal developmental patterns may benefit patients with cere- bral palsy. The greatest gains from this therapy are obtained during the first few years of life, and therapy should not be continued when no improvement is apparent. Bracing and splinting are of questionable benefit, although night splints may be useful in preventing equinus deformity of the feet or adduction contractures of the hips. Orthopedic surgery is useful for treating joint contractures that interfere with function. In general, muscle transfers are unpredictable in cerebral palsy, and most orthopedic proce- dures are directed at tendon lengthening or bony stabiliza- tion by osteotomy or arthrodesis. Flexion and adduction of the hip due to hyperactivity of the adductors and flexors may produce a progressive para- lytic dislocation of the hip, which can lead to pain and dysfunction. Treatment of this dislocation is difficult and unsatisfactory. The principal preventive measure is abduc- tion bracing, but this must often be supplemented by release of the adductors and hip flexors in order to prevent disloca- tion. In severe cases, osteotomy of the femur may also be necessary to correct the bony deformities of femoral antever- sion and coxa valga that are invariably present. Patients with a predominantly athetotic pattern are poor candidates for any surgical procedure or bracing. Because it is difficult to predict the outcome of surgical procedures in cerebral palsy, the surgeon must examine patients on several occasions before any operative procedure is undertaken. Follow-up care by a physical therapist to maximize the anticipated long-term gains should be arranged before the operation.

ORTHOPEDIC ASPECTS OF MYELODYSPLASIA Patients born with spina bifida cystica (aperta) should be examined early by an orthopedic surgeon. The level of neurologic involvement determines the muscle imbalance that will be present and apt to produce deformity with growth. The involvement is often asymmetrical and tends to change during the first 12–18 months of life. Early closure of the sac is the rule, although there has been some hesitancy to provide treatment to all of these patients because of the extremely poor prognosis associated with congenital hydro- cephalus, high levels of paralysis, and associated congenital anomalies. A high percentage of these children have hydro- cephalus, which may be evident at birth or shortly thereafter, requiring shunting. Associated musculoskeletal problems may include clubfoot, congenital dislocation of the hip, arthrogryposis-type changes of the lower extremities, and congenital scoliosis. The most common lesions are at the level of L3–4 and tend to affect the hip joint, with progressive dislocation occurring during growth. Foot deformities may be in any direction and are complicated by the fact that sensation is generally absent. Spinal deformities develop in a high percentage of these children, with scoliosis present in approximately 40%. Ambulation may require long leg braces. Careful urologic follow-up must be obtained to prevent complications from bladder dysfunction. In children who have a reasonable likelihood of walking, operative treatment consists of reduction of the hip and alignment of the feet in the weight-bearing position as well as stabilization of the scoliosis. In children who lack active quadriceps function and extensor power of the knee, the likelihood of ambulation is greatly decreased. In such patients, aggressive surgery in the hip region may result in stiffening of the joints, thus preventing sitting. Multiple foot operations are also contraindicated in these children. The overall treatment of the child with spina bifida should be coordinated in a multidisciplinary clinic where various medical specialists work with therapists, social work- ers, and teachers to provide the best possible care.

NEOPLASIA OF THE  MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM Neoplastic diseases of the musculoskeletal system are a serious problem because of the poor prognosis of malignant tumors arising in bone or other tissues derived from meso- derm. Fortunately, few of the benign lesions undergo malig- nant transformation. Accurate diagnosis depends on correla- tion of the clinical, radiographic, and microscopic findings. Complaints about the knee should be investigated for tumor, although the usual causes of knee pain are traumatic, infec- tious, or developmental in origin.

It usually presents as a pain-free mass. When present, pain is caused by adventitious bursitis or tendinitis due to irritation by the tumor. The lesion may be single or multiple. Pathologically, the lesion is a bone mass capped with carti- lage. These masses tend to grow during childhood and adolescence in proportion to the child’s growth. On radiograph, the tumors tend to be in the metaphysial region of long bones and may be pedunculated or sessile. The cortex of the underlying bone “flows” into the base of the tumor. An osteochondroma should be excised if it interferes with function, is frequently traumatized, or is large enough to be deforming. The prognosis is excellent. Malignant transfor- mation is very rare. Bottner F et al: Surgical treatment of symptomatic osteochon- droma: A three- to eight-year follow-up study. J Bone Joint Surg Br 2003;85:1161 [PMID: 14653600]. OSTEOID OSTEOMA Osteoid osteoma classically produces night pain that can be relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. On phys- ical examination there usually is tenderness over the lesion. An osteoid osteoma in the upper femur may cause pain referred to the knee. On radiograph, the lesion is a radiolucent nidus sur- rounded by dense osteosclerosis that may obscure the nidus. Bone scan shows intense uptake in the lesion. Surgical incision or radiofrequency ablation of the nidus is curative and may be done using computed tomography imaging and minimally invasive technique. The prognosis is excellent, with no known cases of malignant transformation, although the lesion has a tendency to recur. ENCHONDROMA Enchondroma is usually a silent lesion unless it produces a pathologic fracture. On radiograph it is radiolucent, usually in a long bone. A speckled calcification may be present. The classic lesion looks as though someone dragged his or her fingernails through clay, making streaks in the bones. Enchondroma is treated by surgical curettage and bone grafting. The prognosis is excellent. Malignant transforma- tion may occur but is very rare in childhood. CHONDROBLASTOMA In chondroblastoma, the presenting complaint is pain around a joint. This neoplasm may produce a pathologic fracture. On radiograph, the lesion is radiolucent and usually located in the epiphysis. Calcification is unusual, with little or no reac- tive bone. The lesion is treated by surgical curettage and bone grafting. The prognosis is excellent if complete curettage is performed. There is no known malignant transformation. Masui F et al: Chondroblastoma: A study of 11 cases. Eur J Surg Oncol 2002;28:869 [PMID: 12477480]. NONOSSIFYING FIBROMA Nonossifying fibroma is also called benign cortical defect and is nearly always an incidental finding on radiograph. The most frequent sites are the distal femur and proximal tibia. Nonossi- fying fibroma is a radiolucent lesion eccentrically located in the bone. Usually a thin sclerotic border is evident. Multiple lesions may be present. No treatment is needed because these lesions heal as they ossify with maturation of the bone and growth. OSTEOSARCOMA In osteosarcoma, the presenting complaint is usually pain in a long bone, although functional loss, the mass of the tumor, or limp may be the complaint. Pathologic fracture is com- mon. The malignant osseous tumor produces a destructive expanding and invasive lesion. A triangle may be adjacent to the tumor produced by elevated periosteum and subsequent tumor ossification. The lesion may contain calcification and violates the cortex of the bone. Femur, tibia, humerus, and other long bones are the sites usually affected. Surgical excision (limb salvage) or amputation is indi- cated based on the extent of the tumor. The lesion is radiore- sistant and does not respond to radiation therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is routinely used prior to surgical excision. The prognosis is improving, with 60–70% long-term survival rates being reported in modern series. Death usually occurs as a result of lung metastasis. DiCaprio MR, Friedlaender GE: Malignant bone tumors: Limb sparing versus amputation. J Am Acad Orthop Surg 2003;11:25 [PMID: 12699369]. EWING SARCOMA In Ewing sarcoma, the presenting complaint is usually pain and tenderness. Fever and leukocytosis may also be present, which makes osteomyelitis the main differential diagnosis. The lesion may be multicentric. Ewing sarcoma is radiolu- cent and destroys the cortex, frequently in the diaphysial region. Reactive bone formation may occur about the lesion, seen as successive layers of so-called onion skin layering. Treatment is with multiagent chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical resection. The prognosis is poor in patients with large tumor size, pelvic lesions, and poor response to chemotherapy. MISCELLANEOUS DISEASES OF BONE FIBROUS DYSPLASIA Dysplastic fibrous tissue replacement of the medullary canal is accompanied by the formation of metaplastic bone in fibrous dysplasia. Three forms of the disease are recognized:   CHAPTER 24 766 monostotic, polyostotic, and polyostotic with endocrine dis- turbances (precocious puberty in females, hyperthyroidism, and hyperadrenalism [Albright syndrome]).  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The lesion or lesions may be asymptomatic. Pain, if present, is probably due to pathologic fractures. In females, endo- crine disturbances may be present in the polyostotic variety and associated with café-au-lait spots. B. Laboratory Findings Laboratory findings are normal unless endocrine distur- bances are present, in which case secretion of gonadotropic, thyroid, or adrenal hormones may be increased. C. Imaging The lesion begins centrally within the medullary canal, usu- ally of a long bone, and expands slowly. Pathologic fracture may occur. If metaplastic bone predominates, the contents of the lesion will be of the density of bone. The disease is often asymmetrical, and limb length disturbances may occur as a result of stimulation of epiphysial cartilage growth. Marked deformity of the bone may result, and a shepherd’s crook deformity of the upper femur is a classic feature of the disease.  Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes other fibrous lesions of bone as well as destructive lesions such as unicameral bone cyst, eosinophilic granuloma, aneurysmal bone cyst, nonossi- fying fibroma, enchondroma, and chondromyxoid fibroma.  Treatment & Prognosis If the lesion is small and asymptomatic, no treatment is needed. If the lesion is large and produces or threatens pathologic fracture, curettage and bone grafting are indi- cated. Unless the lesions impair epiphysial growth, the prog- nosis for patients with fibrous dysplasia is good. Lesions tend to enlarge during the growth period but are stable during adult life. Malignant transformation is rare. UNICAMERAL BONE CYST Unicameral bone cyst occurs in the metaphysis of a long bone, usually in the femur or humerus. It begins within the medullary canal adjacent to the epiphysial cartilage. It prob- ably results from some fault in enchondral ossification. The cyst is considered active as long as it abuts onto the metaphy- sial side of the epiphysial cartilage, and there is a risk of growth arrest with or without treatment. When a border of normal bone exists between the cyst and the epiphysial cartilage, the cyst is inactive. The lesion is usually identified when a pathologic fracture occurs, produc- ing pain. Laboratory findings are normal. On radiograph, the cyst is identified centrally within the medullary canal, producing expansion of the cortex and thinning over the widest portion of the cyst. Treatment consists of curettage and bone grafting. The cyst may heal after a fracture. Dormans JP, Pill SG: Fractures through bone cysts: Unicameral bone cysts, aneurysmal bone cysts, fibrous cortical defects, and nonossifying fibromas. Instr Course Lect 2002;51:457 [PMID: 12064135]. ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST Aneurysmal bone cyst is similar to unicameral bone cyst, but it contains blood rather than clear fluid. It usually occurs in a slightly eccentric position in the long bone, expanding the cortex of the bone but not breaking the cortex. Involvement of the flat bones of the pelvis is less common. On radio- graphs, the lesion appears somewhat larger than the width of the epiphysial cartilage. This feature distinguishes it from unicameral bone cyst. Chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with aneurysmal bone cyst. The lesion may appear aggressive histologically, and it is important to differentiate it from osteosarcoma or hemangioma. Treatment is by curettage and bone grafting. The prognosis is good. INFANTILE CORTICAL  HYPEROSTOSIS (CAFFEY SYNDROME) Infantile cortical hyperostosis is a benign disease of un- known cause that has its onset before age 6 months and is characterized by irritability, fever, and nonsuppurating, ten- der, painful swellings. Swellings may involve almost any bone of the body and are frequently widespread. Classically, swellings of the mandible and clavicle occur in 50% of patients; swellings of the ulna, humerus, and ribs also occur. The disease is limited to the shafts of bones and does not involve subcutaneous tissues or joints. It is self-limited but may persist for weeks or months. Anemia, leukocytosis, an increased ESR, and elevation of the serum alkaline phospha- tase concentration are usually present. Cortical hyperostosis is demonstrable by a typical radiographic appearance and may be diagnosed on physical examination by an experi- enced pediatrician. Fortunately the disease appears to be decreasing in fre- quency. Indomethacin may be useful for treatment. The prognosis is good, and the disease usually terminates without deformity. GANGLION A ganglion is a smooth, small cystic mass connected by a pedicle to the joint capsule, usually on the dorsum of the  ORTHOPEDICS 767 wrist. It may also occur in the tendon sheath over the flexor surfaces of the fingers. These ganglia can be excised if they interfere with function or cause persistent pain. BAKER CYST A Baker cyst is a herniation of the synovium in the knee joint into the popliteal region. In children, the diagnosis may be made by aspiration of mucinous fluid, but the cyst nearly always disappears with time. Whereas Baker cysts may be indicative of intra-articular disease in the adult, they occur without internal derangement in children and rarely require excision.

790,Basic Principles,Liver & Pancreas ,468,"BASIC PRINCIPLES The basic unit of the musculoskeletal system is the muscle fiber, which can be classified as slow twitch, fast twitch, or intermediate type. Slow twitch (type 1) fibers are usually smaller, are recruited in muscle contractions first, and are innervated by smaller motor neurons. Fast twitch (type 2) fibers make up white muscle and are usually larger. They are recruited when the body needs to produce rapid muscle tension. They produce more lactic acid than type 1 fibers. An intermediate (type 2a) fiber is called fast oxidative glycolytic, or FOG. Untrained individuals have a 50:50 proportion of type 1 to type 2 fibers. Elite long distance runners can have up to 90% type 1 fibers. This apparent adaptation raises a question as to whether an athlete is genetically programmed or can develop adaptations that allow success in sports. Exercise generates cardiorespiratory system responses, including increased VO2 max (maximum amount of oxy- gen that can be consumed), increased cardiac output, reduced resting heart rate, and improved blood pressure responses. Biomechanics is the study of movement and how the forces generated by the neuromuscular system translate into movement. It integrates principles of both biology and physics. Through biomechanics we can understand the intri- cacies of movement and how these movements affect athletic performance and result in injuries. Types of Muscle Contraction  Associated with Exercise Muscle contractions are divided into three types: isometric, isotonic, and isokinetic. An isometric exercise is exercise against a fixed load in which no movement is achieved. Isometric exercise improves strength at a given angle, but does not affect endurance. Isometric exercise is beneficial for ther- apy during the acute phase of an injury in which certain muscles or groups of muscles need strengthening. Isometric exercise can cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and should be used cautiously if a cardiac condition is present. Isokinetic exercise uses the concept of constant velocity and can provide maximal muscle contractions through full range of motion. This type of exercise generally requires special equipment. Lastly, isotonic exercise uses the principle of constant load and muscle length changes to strengthen mus- cles. It is the most common type of exercise and can be sport- specific. Isotonic exercises can be further classified as below: A. Concentric Exercise In concentric exercises, the force of muscle contraction overcomes an external resistance, which results in shortening of the muscle. These muscles accelerate a distal segment in the kinetic chain and are therefore referred to as open kinetic chain movements. An example of such an exercise is a biceps curl, during which the biceps is actively contracting or shortening to lift the weight. B. Eccentric Exercise In eccentric exercises, contractions increase muscle tension associated with lengthening of the muscle and are used to decelerate a distal segment in the kinetic chain. This type of exercise is exemplified by the squatting motion, in which the quadriceps lengthens under tension to control downward motion. If the terminal segment in the chain is fixed, this type of movement is called closed kinetic chain movement.  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Sports Med 2003;33:727 [PMID: 12895130]. Strength Training Strength is defined as the peak force that can be generated during a single maximal contraction. Strength training uses progressive resistance to improve an athlete’s ability to resist or exert force. This can be achieved by a variety of techniques, including body weight, free weight, or machine resistance. The benefits of weight training are improved performance, endurance, and muscular strength. Weight training can be started in prepubescent athletes and if designed appropriately can be done safely with minimal risk of injury. Tanner staging (see Chapter 32) helps to define readiness for pro- gression to more strenuous programs. Power lifting and weight lifting should be restricted to athletes who have reached or passed Tanner stage V. Individuals at Tanner stage IV or less can safely participate in a strength training program that is specifically and carefully designed for younger athletes. These programs incorporate submaximal resistance with multiple repetitions. They can be generalized or sport-specific. Care should be taken to prevent injuries while using weight-training equipment at home. Children and adults with disabilities can benefit from weight-training programs modified to meet their specific needs.

791,Preparticipation History & Physical  Examination,Liver & Pancreas ,1784,"PREPARTICIPATION HISTORY  & PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The preparticipation medical examination evaluates and screens for potential medical problems that could occur during athletic participation. The objectives of this evalua- tion are to establish baseline medical information, detect any medical condition that might limit athletic participation, evaluate the athlete for preventable injuries, meet the legal or insurance requirements of most states, assess the athlete’s maturity, and make recommendations for protective equip- ment. The ideal timing of the examination is at least 4–6 weeks before training starts. This allows time for any needed interventions by the physician. Preparticipation History The history is the most important part of the encounter. Many key elements need to be explored with the athlete. Standardized history forms are available both on the Internet and in monographs. Figure 25–1A is one example of the essential questions contained in a preparticipation history. The history must include the following areas: A. Cardiovascular History The physician should note any history of cardiac murmurs, chest pain at rest or with exertion, syncopal episodes or sudden fatigue, shortness of breath, or recent illnesses with chest pain. The family history should specifically ask about underlying cardiac diseases, including hypertrophic cardio- myopathy, prolonged QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, arrhythmias, and sudden death in family members. These questions may help identify potentially life-threatening car- diac lesions. The most common causes of sudden death in young athletes on the playing field are hypertrophic cardio- myopathy and congenital heart lesions. B. History of Hypertension Any history of hypertension requires investigation. The cur- rent guidelines for the diagnosis of hypertension are blood pressure above 130/75 mm Hg in a child younger than age 10 years or blood pressure above 140/85 mm Hg in a child 10 years of age or older. C. History of Chronic Diseases Diseases such as reactive airway disease or exercise-induced asthma, diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, chronic infec- tions, neurologic disorders, or hematologic diseases should be noted. D. Musculoskeletal Limitations and Prior Injuries The physician should explore limited range of motion and muscle weakness along with prior injuries that may affect future performance. Chronic pain or soreness long after activ- ity may reflect overuse syndromes that should be evaluated. E. Menstrual History in Females The physician should pay particular attention to the so- called female athletic triad: amenorrhea, eating disorders, and osteoporosis. F. Nutritional Issues The physician should record methods the athlete uses to maintain, gain, or lose weight. G. Medication History This information will provide data on current medications whose side effects may suggest activity modifications. Also, documenting drug use may provide the opportunity to explore with the patient drawbacks of using performance- enhancing compounds such as anabolic steroids, creatine, stimulants, and narcotics.   SPORTS MEDICINE 773 participation.

795,Rehabilitation of Sports Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,2784,"REHABILITATION OF SPORTS INJURIES Participation in sports can have great benefits. It provides physical activity, acquisition of motor skills, and social opportunities. All sports participation, however, carries an inherent risk of injuries. These injuries are classified as either acute or chronic. Chronic injuries occur over time and are related to repetitive stress. These injuries develop in response to overuse, repeated microtrauma, and inadequate repair of injured tissue. Acute injuries or macrotrauma are one-time events that can cause alterations in biomechanics and physiology. Response to an acute injury occurs in two predictable phases. The first week is characterized by an acute inflamma- tory response. During this time initial vasoconstriction is followed by vasodilation. Chemical mediators of inflamma- tion are released, resulting in the classical physical findings of local swelling, warmth, pain, and loss of function. This phase is essential in healing of the injury. The proliferative phase occurs over the next 2–4 weeks and involves repair and clean-up. Fibroblasts infiltrate and lay down new collagen. Lastly, the maturation phase allows for repair and regenera- tion of the damaged tissues. The management of acute sports injuries is geared toward optimizing healing and restoring function. The goals of immediate care are to minimize the effects of the injury by reducing pain and swelling, to educate the athlete about the nature of the injury and how to take care of it, and to maintain the health of the rest of the body. The treatment for an acute injury is captured in the acronym PRICE: • Protect the injury from further damage (taping, splints, braces) • Rest the area • Ice • Compression of the injury • Elevation immediately Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the inflammatory response and reduce discomfort. These medications may be used immediately after the injury. Glu- cocorticoids should be administered judiciously. If adminis- tered inappropriately they may prolong the acute phase of recovery. Therapeutic use of physical modalities, including early cold and later heat, hydrotherapy, massage, electrical stimulation, iontophoresis, and ultrasound, can enhance recovery in the acute phase. The recovery phase can be lengthy and requires athlete participation. Initial treatment is focused on joint range of motion and flexibility. Range-of-motion exercises should follow a logical progression of starting with passive motion, then moving to active assistive, and finally to active move- ment. Active range of motion is initiated once normal joint range has been reestablished. Flexibility exercises are sport- specific and aimed at reducing tight musculature. Strength training can begin early in this phase of rehabilitation. Initially only isometric exercises are encouraged. As recovery progresses and flexibility increases, isotonic and isokinetic exercises can be added to the program. These should be done at least three times per week.   CHAPTER 25 776 As the athlete approaches near-normal strength and is pain-free, the final maintenance phase can be introduced. During this phase the athlete continues to build strength and work on endurance. The biomechanics of sport-specific activ- ity need to be analyzed and retraining incorporated into the exercise program. Generalized cardiovascular conditioning should continue during the entire rehabilitation treatment. "

Athletes who have had recent infectious mononucleosis can return to  noncontact training at 3 wk as long as there is no splenic  enlargement. They may return to contact sports after 4 wk and a  normal abdominal examination. Athletes with a streptococcal pharyngitis can resume activity once  treatment has been initiated and they are afebrile. If a localized herpes gladiatorum or impetigo lesion is present, no  contact sports are allowed until the lesions have resolved. Athletes  with herpes zoster have the same restrictions. There are no  restrictions for athletes with common warts. Athletes with mollus- cum contagiosum can compete if the affected areas are covered.  Athletes with furuncles cannot be involved in contact sports or  swimming until the lesions are healed. Athletes with HIV infection may compete in all types of sports.  Universal precautions should be used with all athletes who have  sustained injuries.   CHAPTER 25 776 As the athlete approaches near-normal strength and is pain-free, the final maintenance phase can be introduced.

COMMON SPORTS MEDICINE  ISSUES & INJURIES INFECTIOUS DISEASES Infectious diseases are common in both recreational and competitive athletes. These illnesses have an effect on basic physiologic function and athletic performance.

798,Head & Neck Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,949,"HEAD & NECK INJURIES Head and neck injuries occur most commonly in contact and individual sports. The sports with the highest incidences of brain injury are football, bicycling, baseball, horseback riding, and golf. The treatment of these injuries is controver- sial, and multiple guidelines have been developed. As a general rule, however, treatment of injuries in young chil- dren should be as conservative as possible because of their developing central nervous systems. 1.

The pathophysiology is related to alterations in brain metabolism and the release of neurotransmitters. Concussions have been categorized by many different grading systems, but recent consensus recommends all ath- letes should be removed from play until symptoms have resolved. Once symptoms have resolved a six-step progres- sion is outlined for return to play: (1) assess at rest; once asymptomatic progress to (2) light aerobic exercise, followed by (3) sport-specific exercise, then begin (4) noncontact drills followed by (5) contact drills, and finally (6) release to game play. If any symptoms are present, the athlete should not move to the next step. Preseason testing may help practitioners in assessing acute concussive status. Among commonly used assessment tools are the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), computerized testing, and symptoms checklist (Table 25–4). Neuropsychology testing is advocated for athletes with persistent symptoms. Recent findings related to multiple concussions in athletes indicate that one concussion episode places an athlete at a higher risk for a repeat concussion, and that children with repeat concussions may have more severe injuries with protracted recovery times. In general, conservative return to play guidelines should be used in children. 2. Second Impact Syndrome Second impact syndrome is a rare but potentially deadly complication of head injuries. Athletes who have had a prior brain injury that has not healed and have a second injury are at risk for a loss of vascular autoregulation and subsequent malignant cerebral edema. 3. Atlantoaxial Instability Atlantoaxial instability is common in children with Down syndrome because of underlying ligamentous laxity, includ- ing the annular ligament of C1, and hypotonia. Cervical neck films including flexion, extension, and neutral position eval- uate the atlanto-dens interval (ADI). ADI is normally less than 2.5 mm, but up to 4.5 mm is acceptable in this population. Children with an ADI greater than 4.5 mm should be limited from contact and collision activities. Dimberg EL: Management of common neurologic conditions in sports.

Burners & Stingers ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Symptoms appear on the same side as an injury to the neck and shoulder.  Burning pain or numbness in the shoulder and arm.  Weakness may be present. Burners and stingers are common injuries in contact sports, especially football. These types of cervical radiculopathies or brachial plexopathies occur when the head is laterally bent and the shoulder depressed. Symptoms include immediate burning pain and paresthesias down one arm generally lasting only minutes. Weakness in the muscles of the upper trunk—supraspinatus, deltoid, and biceps—can persist for weeks. The most important part of the workup is a thorough neurologic assessment to differentiate this injury from a serious cervical spine injury. The key distinguishing feature of the stinger is its unilateral nature. If symptoms persist, then a diagnostic evaluation should include cervical spine radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and electromyography. Treatment consists of removal from play and observa- tion. The athlete can return to play once symptoms have resolved, neck and shoulder range of motion is pain-free, reflexes and strength are normal, and the Spurling test is negative. Preventative strategies include always wearing pro- tective gear, proper blocking and tackling techniques, and maintaining neck and shoulder strength.

799,Spine Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,4012,"SPINE INJURIES Injuries to the spine are fairly common even in the pediatric population. As children have become more competitive in sports, the number of reported injuries has increased. Sports with a fairly high incidence of back injuries include golf, gymnastics, football, dance, wrestling, and weightlifting. Pain lasting more than 2 weeks indicates a possible structural problem and needs to be investigated. Table 25–4. Concussion: symptom checklist. Headache Dizziness Balance problems Nausea Vomiting Light sensitivity Noise sensitivity Ringing in the ears Fatigue or excessive sleepiness Sleep abnormalities Memory problems Concentration difficulties Irritability Behavioral changes   CHAPTER 25 778 Acute injury to the spine often results from an axial load injury. Patients present with focal tenderness of the thoracic or thoracolumbar spine. Evaluation includes plain radiogra- phy that may demonstrate mild wedging of the thoracic vertebra. When significant spinal tenderness or any neuro- logical abnormalities are present, radiographs are often fol- lowed by computed tomography (CT) or MRI. Treatment of minor compression fractures includes pain control, bracing, rest from high-risk sports, and physical therapy. With appro- priate rehabilitation, athletes can usually return to contact activity within 8 weeks. 1. Spondylolysis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Injury to the pars interarticularis.  Usually presents as back pain with extension. Spondylolysis is an injury to the pars interarticularis. Pars defects are present in 4–6% of the population. The percent- age of pars defects in athletes such as gymnasts, dancers, divers, and wrestlers is significantly increased. Repetitive overload results in stress fractures. Spondylolysis occurs at L5 in 85% of cases. The athlete presents with back pain that is aggravated by extension, such as arching the back in gymnastics. There may be palpable tenderness over the lower lumbar vertebrae, along with pain on the single leg hyperex- tension test. Tight hamstrings are another common physical examination finding. Evaluation includes anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine. Although oblique radiographic views of the lumbar spine are helpful to look for the so-called Scottie dog sign, they are falling out of favor because they often fail to show the lesion. Single photon emission computed tomography scan, CT scan, and MRI can be useful to determine the presence of an active spondylolytic lesion. Treatment includes refraining from hyperextension and high-impact sporting activities, stretching of the hamstrings, stabilization exercises, and lumbosacral bracing. Athletes can cross-train with low-impact activity and neutral or flexion- based physical therapy. Return to play is often delayed 6 weeks or longer based on clinical signs of healing. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases. 2. Spondylolisthesis When a bilateral pars injury occurs, slippage of one vertebra over another causes a spondylolisthesis. These injuries are graded from 1 to 4 based on the percentage of slippage: grade 1 (0–25%), grade 2 (25–49%), grade 3 (50–74%), and grade 4 (75–100%). Patients present with hyperlordosis, kyphosis, pain with hyperextension, and in severe cases, a palpable step-off. Diagnosis is based on lateral radiographs. Treatment is often symptom based. Asymptomatic ath- letes with less than 30% slippage have no restrictions and are followed on a routine basis. Slippage of 50% or more requires interventions of stretching hip flexors and ham- strings, working on core stability, along with bracing or surgery. If surgery is required, the athlete must understand that he or she cannot return to activities for at least a year and may not be able return to previous sporting activities. 3. Disk Herniation Discogenic back pain accounts for a small percentage of back injuries in children. These injuries are almost unheard of in preadolescence. Back pain can originate from disk hernia- tion, apophyseal injury, and disk degeneration. Most injuries occur at L4–L5 and L5–S1 vertebrae. Symptoms include back and leg pain. Pain may be increased with activities such as bending, sitting, and coughing. Pain often radiates down the lower extremity in a radicular pattern. Evaluation includes physical and neurologic examinations, including straight leg testing, sensory testing, and checking reflexes. If symptoms persist, evaluation includes electromyography, CT, and MRI scans. Treatment usually is conservative as most back injuries improve spontaneously. The athlete can rest the back for a short period and then begin a structured exercise program of extension and isometrics followed by flexion exercises. If symptoms persist, a short course of steroids may be indi- cated. Surgery is recommended only if neurologic compro- mise persists. Eddy D et al: A review of spine injuries and return to play.

800,Shoulder Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,4412,"SHOULDER INJURIES Shoulder injury is usually a result of acute trauma or chronic overuse. Acute injuries around the shoulder include contu- sions, fractures, sprains (or separations), and dislocations. The age of the patient affects the injury pattern, as younger patients are more likely to sustain fractures instead of sprains. 1. Fracture of the Clavicle Clavicular fractures occur from a fall or direct trauma to the shoulder. Focal swelling and tenderness are present over the clavicle. Diagnosis is made by radiographs of the clavicle; the fractures are most common in the middle third of the bone. Initial treatment is focused on pain control and protec- tion with a sling and swathe. Early range of motion is permitted, based on pain level. Progressive rehabilitation is important. Athletes cannot return to contact sports for 8–10 weeks. Surgical indications for acute clavicular fractures include open fractures or neurovascular compromise. Frac-   CHAPTER 25 780 Proximal humeral epiphysitis, or “Little League shoulder,” is an overuse injury that occurs in children aged 11–14 years who play overhead sports such as baseball. The patient presents with activity-related pain in the lateral aspect of the proximal humerus. Examination often shows tenderness over the proximal humerus. However, benign findings on office examination do not preclude this diagnosis. The hall- mark feature is pain with throwing. Radiographs show wid- ening, sclerosis, and irregularity of the proximal humeral physis. Comparison views are often helpful when consider- ing this diagnosis. Treatment consists of rest from throwing or other aggra- vating activity. Physical therapy is initiated during the rest period. Return to play can only be accomplished after a period of rest has significantly decreased the pain and the athlete has proceeded through a progressive throwing pro- gram. Healing can take several months. Signs of radiographic healing may lag behind the athlete’s clinical progress, and normal radiographs are not necessarily required to return an athlete to play.

802,Elbow & Forearm Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,1362,"ELBOW & FOREARM INJURIES Injuries in the forearm are quite common with both chronic and acute etiologies (eg, the chronic overuse “Little League elbow” and the frequent childhood fracture typical of falls on an outstretched arm). When evaluating the elbow, consider dividing the examination into specific anatomic areas as discussed below. 1. Medial Epicondylitis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Participation in a throwing sport.  Pain over the medial condyles, especially with pitching.  Swelling medial elbow.  Elbow flexion contracture. Medial epicondylitis, often called Little League elbow, encompasses a group of abnormalities that develop in young baseball pitchers secondary to the biomechanical forces gen- erated around the elbow during throwing. These forces can result in shearing, inflammation, traction, and abnormal bone development. The symptoms are primarily swelling, pain, performance difficulties, and weakness. The pain local- izes to the medial epicondyle, which may be tender to palpation. Wrist flexion and pronation increase symptoms. Workup includes a series of elbow radiographs, including comparison films, to look for widening of the epiphyseal lines and possibly MRI studies. Treatment of the acute injury includes rest from throw- ing. It is not uncommon for a player to be benched for up to 6 weeks. Competition can be resumed once the player is asymptomatic. The key to treating this injury is preven- tion. Children should be properly conditioned and coached in correct throwing biomechanics. Guidelines for pitching limits in youth baseball have been developed. Little League limits 10- to 12-year-old children to 6 innings per week and 13- to 15-year-old children to 9 innings per week. Guidelines for limiting pitches per game are outlined in Table 25–5. 2. Panner Disease Panner disease refers to variations in the normal ossifica- tion of the capitellum. This condition occurs in children aged 5–12 years who play sports that involve overhead throwing. The child may have dull aching in the lateral elbow that generally worsens when throwing. Swelling and reduced elbow extension usually are present. Radiographs show an abnormal capitellum, with fragmentation and areas of sclerosis. Treatment is conservative, using rest, ice, and splinting. The child can return to play after radiographs normalize. The natural history of this condition is one of complete resolution of symptoms and ultimately normal ossification of the capitellum. 3. Osteochondritis Dissecans Lateral elbow pain in a slightly older throwing athlete, usually aged 13–15 years, can be secondary to osteochondri- tis dissecans. Valgus compressive forces can lead to avascular necrosis of the capitellum, which can result in the formation of loose bodies. The athlete presents with lateral pain, swell- ing, lack of full extension, and occasionally locking. Radio- graphs and MRI can more fully delineate the lesion. Table 25–5. Guidelines for pitching  limits in youth baseball. Age (years) Pitches per Gamea 8–10 52 ± 15 11–12 68 ± 18 13–14 76 ± 16 15–16 91 ± 16 16–17 106 ± 16 aBased on 2 games per week.   SPORTS MEDICINE 781 Treatment is based on classification and can be either conservative or surgical. The child should be seen by an orthopedic specialist with expertise in upper extremity injuries. 4. Lateral Epicondylitis Lateral epicondylitis is common in skeletally mature athletes participating in racquet sports, particularly tennis. It is an overuse of the extensor muscle in the forearm and causes pain in the lateral elbow. Pain is increased by wrist extension. Initial treatment is aimed at inflammation control. Stretching and strengthening of forearm muscles are the primary interventions during the subsequent phases. Stroke mechanics may need to be altered and a forearm brace used to decrease the forces in the extensor muscles. 5. Posterior Elbow Pain Posterior elbow pain is uncommon. Etiologies include dislo- cations, fractures, triceps avulsions, olecranon apophysitis, and olecranon bursitis. Benjamin HJ et al: Little League elbow. Clin Sports Med 2005;15:1 [PMID: 15654190].

803,Hand & Wrist Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,1222,"HAND & WRIST INJURIES All hand and wrist injuries have the potential for long-term, serious disability and deserve a thorough evaluation. 1. Distal Phalanx Injury Tuft injury requires splinting for 6 weeks or until the patient is pain-free. If there is significant displacement, then a K- wire can be used for reduction. Nail bed injury often requires splinting and drainage of subungual hematomas. 2. Distal Interphalangeal Injury Mallet finger or extensor tendon avulsion occurs in ball- handling sports. The mechanism of injury is a force applied to an extended finger. Treatment is splinting in extension for 6 weeks for fractures and 8 weeks for tendon rupture. 3. Thumb Injury Gamekeeper’s thumb is an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament from forced abduction of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It is a common skiing injury. If a radiograph shows an avulsed fragment is displaced less than 2 mm, a thumb spica cast can be used. If there is no fragment and less than 35 degrees of lateral joint space opening, a spica cast for 6 weeks is indicated. Surgery is required for more serious injuries. 4. Fractures Boxer’s fracture is a neck fracture of the fifth digit. These fractures can be treated by closed reduction and casting for 3 weeks. A displaced fracture requires open reduction and internal fixation. 5. Wrist Injury Most swollen wrists without evidence of instability can be splinted for several weeks. Radial and ulnar fractures, which are fairly common in children, must be ruled out. Scaphoid fractures are caused by a force applied to a hyperextended wrist. If evidence of snuffbox tenderness and swelling is present, the wrist must be immobilized for 10 days and then reassessed, even if radiographs are normal. A nondisplaced fracture requires at least 6 weeks of immobilization in a thumb spica cast. Nonunion can occur, particularly in frac- tures of the proximal pole of the scaphoid, and is related to the poor blood supply to this carpal bone. Displacement requires operative management.

HIP INJURIES Because the pelvis and hip articulate with both the lower extremities and the spine, this area is rich in ligaments, muscle attachments, and nerves. Injuries in young children are rare, but sprains, strains, and avulsion fractures are common. Additionally, athletes can be susceptible to overuse injury involving the hip. 1. Hip Avulsion Fractures ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fractures at apophyseal areas.  Pain with weight bearing.  Focal pain over the site of injury. Avulsion fractures around the hip in adolescents occur at apophyseal regions such as the ischial tuberosity, anterior superior iliac spine, anterior inferior iliac spine, and iliac crest.

803,Hip Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,3498,"HIP INJURIES Because the pelvis and hip articulate with both the lower extremities and the spine, this area is rich in ligaments, muscle attachments, and nerves. Injuries in young children are rare, but sprains, strains, and avulsion fractures are common. Additionally, athletes can be susceptible to overuse injury involving the hip. 1. Hip Avulsion Fractures ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fractures at apophyseal areas.  Pain with weight bearing.  Focal pain over the site of injury. Avulsion fractures around the hip in adolescents occur at apophyseal regions such as the ischial tuberosity, anterior superior iliac spine, anterior inferior iliac spine, and iliac crest. The mechanism of injury is a forceful, unbalanced muscle contraction that causes avulsion of the muscle ten- don insertion. The athlete presents with a history of an acute traumatic incident; often a “pop” is felt and the athlete is immediately unable to bear weight. Range of motion of the   SPORTS MEDICINE 783 The hip joint can be dislocated in forceful injuries. Most hip dislocations occur in the posterior direction. Athletes with this injury classically present with hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. Hip dislocations in skeletally mature ath- letes are almost always associated with acetabular and femoral neck fracture. The preadolescent, skeletally immature com- petitor may have an isolated injury. Hip radiographs and CT scan may be needed to completely evaluate the injury. This is a true on-field emergency, and the athlete should be transported to the nearest facility that has an orthopedic surgeon available. Severe bleeding, avascular necrosis, and nerve damage can result. Once reduction has been estab- lished in an uncomplicated case, protected weight bearing on crutches for 6 weeks is recommended followed by another 6 weeks of range-of-motion and strengthening exercises. An athlete may return gradually to competition after 3 months, when strength and motion are normal. 8. Pelvic Apophysitis Pelvic apophysitis occurs in adolescent athletes who are typically competitive and are participating consistently, often year round, in their sport. Common locations are the ischial tuberosity and iliac crest. The athlete presents with pain over the apophysis and pain with resisted hip motion specific to the muscle insertion. Radiographs can show irregularity over the apophysis, or be normal. Treatment consists of relative rest, progressive rehabilitation focusing on flexibility, and pelvis and core stabilization. 9. Iliotibial Band Syndrome Iliotibial band syndrome and associated trochanteric bursitis can cause pain when the hip is flexed, often as a result of reduced flexibility of the iliotibial band and gluteus medius tendons. The bursa is a structure that allows for improved motion by reducing friction. When a bursa becomes in- flamed, movement is painful and may be limited. Other areas susceptible to inflammation, besides the hip, are the shoulder, elbow, and patella. Iliotibial band syndrome is best evaluated in a side-lying position, and pain is reproduced when the hip is actively flexed from a fully extended hip (Ober test). Initial treatment is to alter the offending activity and then start a stretching program geared at the iliotibial band and hip abductors. Ultrasound is beneficial and corticosteroid injec- tions may be used after conservative treatment has failed. 10. Femoral Neck Fractures Femoral neck fractures (stress fractures) are generally the result of repetitive microtrauma. They commonly occur in running athletes who have increased their mileage. Athletes with this type of injury present with persistent pain in the groin and pain with internal and external rotation. Range of motion may be limited in hip flexion and internal rotation. If plain radiographs are negative, an MRI or a bone scan is indicated. Treatment is based on the type of fracture. A transverse fracture generally requires internal fixation to prevent femo- ral displacement and the risk of avascular necrosis. A com- pression fracture is less likely to be displaced; treatment is conservative and involves resting the hip until it heals. Cardiovascular conditioning can be maintained easily through nonimpact exercises and activity. Cooper DE: Severe quadriceps muscle contusions in athletes.

805,Knee Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,3500,"KNEE INJURIES Knee injuries are one of the most common sports-related prob- lems. The knee is stabilized through a variety of ligaments, tendons, and the menisci. Knee injuries can be divided into two groups: those resulting from acute or chronic causes. Acute injuries occur from a well-defined traumatic incident. The mechanism of injury is an important historical feature, although many young patients have difficulty describing the details of the inciting event. The onset of rapid swelling after a traumatic event indicates the presence of a hemarthrosis and likely internal derangement such as fracture, rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), meniscal tear, or patellar dislocation. 1. Anterior Knee Pain The most common knee complaint is anterior knee pain. This complaint can have multiple etiologies but should always include hip pathology as a possible source. Patel- lofemoral dysfunction is a common cause of anterior knee pain. The differential diagnosis is quite extensive and requires a thorough examination. A. Patellofemoral Overuse Syndrome Patellofemoral overuse syndrome occurs in runners and in athletes participating in sports that involve repetitive stress in the lower extremity. The athlete presents with activity- related pain in the anterior knee. Classically, pain is located over the medial surface and undersurface of the patella. In young athletes, it is infrequently associated with swelling and crepitus of the knee joint. The Q-angle often is increased. The Q-angle is measured by drawing a line from the antero- superior iliac spine down to the center of the patella and then through the tibial tubercle. The intersecting angle is the Q- angle. Normal is 14 degrees for males and 17 degrees for females. Q-angles greater than 20 degrees tend to cause the patella to track laterally, changing the knee biomechanics. Treatment should be geared toward identifying the cause. Often athletes are overtraining and need to modify their current activities. Cross-training may help. Stretching and strengthening of the hamstrings and quadriceps are recom- mended. Use of braces providing proprioceptive feedback during competition is controversial.   CHAPTER 25 786  Clinical Findings The athlete presents with swelling and pain in the posterior and lateral knee. The examination begins with the unin- jured knee and proceeds to the injured side. Confirmatory testing includes the posterior drawer test, performed with the patient supine, the knee flexed to 90 degrees, and the foot stabilized. Grading is based on the amount of transla- tion. Grade 1 (mild) is up to 5 mm, grade 2 (moderate) is 5–10 mm, and grade 3 (severe) is more than 10 mm. Diagnostic imaging includes plain radiographs and MRI scan.  Treatment Treatment can be determined as soon as the exact injury has been isolated. Treatment is controversial with respect to surgical versus nonsurgical management, although nonsur- gical management is gaining popularity as outcomes tend to be similar for both groups. Braces and a progressive rehabilitation program have been used successfully in athletes with grade 1 and 2 injuries. Athletes with grade 3 injuries and chronic instability may require surgery.

808,Foot & Ankle Injuries,Liver & Pancreas ,1416,"FOOT & ANKLE INJURIES Injuries in the lower leg, ankle, and foot are quite common in pediatric athletes. The types of injuries sustained tend to depend on the age group. Young children tend to have diaphyseal injuries, in contrast to older children in rapid growth, who tend to have epiphyseal and apophyseal inju- ries. Skeletally mature adolescents are prone to adult-pattern ligamentous injury. Although fractures of the ankle are possible with inver- sion and eversion mechanisms, the most common acute injury involving the ankle is the ankle sprain. 1. Ankle Sprain ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Mechanism is usually inversion and plantarflexion.  Swelling and pain in the ankle over the ligament.  Bruising over the ankle. When a ligament is overloaded tearing occurs. These injuries are graded on a scale of 1 to 3. Grade 1 injury is a stretch without instability, grade 2 is a partial tear with some instabil- ity, and grade 3 is a total disruption of the ligament with instability of the joint. The ankle has three lateral ligaments (anterior talofibular, calcaneofibular, and posterior talofibular) and a medial deltoid ligament. Inversion of the foot generally damages the anterior talofibular ligament, whereas eversion injures the deltoid ligament. Lateral ankle sprains are far more common than medial ankle sprains because the deltoid liga- ment is stronger, mechanically, than the lateral ligaments.  Clinical Findings Physical examination often reveals swelling, bruising, and pain. Diagnostic testing should be done when a bony injury is suspected. Obtaining radiographs is especially important when evaluating skeletally immature athletes who are more prone to growth plate injury. The adult Ottawa criteria do not pertain to patients younger than age 18 years. Tenderness over the malleoli, tenderness beyond ligament attachments, and excessive swelling are reasons to obtain radiographs.  Differential Diagnosis Other injuries to consider include injuries to the fifth meta- tarsal, which can occur with an inversion mechanism. In this injury, the athlete presents with localized swelling and ten- derness over the base of the fifth metatarsal. Fractures at the base of the fifth metatarsal can be divided into avulsion, Jones, and diaphyseal fractures. Tibiofibular syndesmosis tear occurs with dorsiflexion and external rotation. Radio- graphs are required, and the squeeze teat is positive. Frac- tures of the malleoli, fibula, talar dome or calcaneus may also mimic ankle sprain.  Treatment Appropriate treatment of ligamentous ankle injuries is impera- tive to ensure full recovery and should begin immediately after the injury. Phase 1 care involves immediate compressive wrap- ping and icing to control swelling and inflammation. Protect- ed weight bearing is allowed in the early phase of rehabilitation. Phase 2 begins when the athlete can ambulate without pain. During this time ankle range of motion is emphasized, along with isometric contractions of the ankle dorsiflexors. Once 90% of strength has returned, active isotonic (eccentric and concen- tric exercises) and isokinetic exercises can be added. Phase 3 is designed to increase strength, improve proprioception, and add ballistic activity. The “foot alphabet” and “tilt board” are excel- lent methods to improve ankle proprioception. This program can be effective in returning athletes to activity within a few weeks, although up to 6 weeks may be required for return to full activity. The athlete should wear a protective brace for 3–4 months and continue to ice after exercising.   788 26 Rehabilitation Medicine Pamela E. Wilson, MD Gerald H. Clayton, PhD Rehabilitation medicine is the multispecialty discipline involved in the diagnosis and therapy of individuals with congenital and acquired disabilities. The overarching goals are to maximize the patient’s functional capabilities and improve quality of life. Disabilities are described using the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Function, Health, and Disability. Three aspects require eval- uation in every patient: (1) the impact of the disability on body structure and function, (2) the impact of the disability on activity and participation, and (3) the environmental factors with an impact on patient function. Evaluation of these three areas provides a common framework for discuss- ing a disabling condition and the impact it has on the body and on the individual’s ability to participate in society. "
810,Pediatric Brain Injury,Kidney & Urinary Tract ,910,"PEDIATRIC BRAIN INJURY  General Considerations Every year there are an estimated 400,000 emergency depart- ment visits for brain injuries among children from birth through 14 years of age, with 3000 deaths and 29,000 hospitalizations. Children with brain injuries may have long- term deficits and disabilities that require identification and treatment. Brain injury is divided into primary and second- ary injury. Primary injury refers to the immediate injury causing focal or diffuse damage. Focal damage includes skull fracture, parenchymal bruising or contusion, extraparenchymal or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, blood clots, tearing of blood vessels, or penetrating injury. Diffuse damage includes diffuse axonal injury and edema. Consequences of primary injury, either focal or diffuse, include cellular disruption with release of excitatory amino acids, opiate peptides, and inflammatory cytokines. Secondary injury refers to the loss of cellular function accompanying primary injury that results in loss of cere- brovascular regulation, altered cellular homeostasis, or cell death and functional dysregulation. A primary injury can initiate the processes of secondary programmed cell death (apoptosis), which further exacerbates the primary injury. Secondary injury may develop hours or days after the initial insult. It appears to be precipitated by elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and release of neurochemical mediators. Clinical Classification &  Severity Scores for Head Injury Traumatic brain injury is usually categorized as open or closed. Open injuries are the result of penetration of the skull by missile or sharp object, or deformation of the skull with exposure of the underlying intracranial tissues. Closed inju- ries occur secondary to blunt trauma to the head, which causes movement (intracranial acceleration or deceleration and rotational forces) and compression of brain tissue. Brain contusions are referred to as coup (occurring at the site of injury) or contra-coup (occurring on the side of the brain opposite the injury). Measures for rating severity of injury and eventual outcomes are important in medical manage- ment. Included below are several common scales: A. Glasgow Coma Scale The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the most commonly used system to assess the depth and duration of impaired con- sciousness in the acute setting. The score is derived from three different areas of evaluation: motor responsiveness (maximum score 6), verbal performance (maximum score 5), and eye opening to stimuli (maximum score 6). The scale has been modified for use in infants and children younger than 5 years of age, allowing for their lack of verbal respon- siveness and understanding (see Table 11–5). Cumulative scores on the GCS define injury as mild (13–15), moderate (9–12), and severe (≤ 8). The concept of post-traumatic amnesia is used to gauge severity of injury and is an adjunct to the GCS, termed the GCS-E (extended). Post-traumatic amnesia is defined as the period of time after an injury Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Gains made in the behavioral realm often have a positive impact on therapies designed to address physical issues.  Prognosis & Outcomes Directly after brain injury, poor pupillary reactivity, low blood pH, absence of deep tendon reflexes, and low GCS all correlate with poor outcome. An increased number of intra- cranial lesions and increased depth and duration of coma are also associated with poor functional recovery. Children younger than 1 year of age tend to have worse outcomes. Functional outcome assessment is important for judging the efficacy of rehabilitation therapy. Global multidomain measures are used to provide a functional “snapshot in time” of select functions—motor function and mobility, self-care, cognition, socialization, and communication. Several of these measures are available; the WeeFIM is the one most commonly used in pediatrics. Outcome associated with mild brain injury is often quite favorable. Most patients recover normal function within a short time frame. A small percentage will develop persistent problems such as chronic headache, poor focusing ability, altered memory, and vestibular abnormalities. In children, recovery may not be fully achieved for many months or years after the initial injury. The impact of the injury on developmental processes, and its future conse- quences, are difficult to predict. Long-term follow-up is required, particularly as the child approaches school age.

813,Spinal Cord Injury,Kidney & Urinary Tract ,2551,"SPINAL CORD INJURY  General Considerations Epidemiologic studies of spinal cord injuries (SCI) suggest that there will be about 10,000 new injuries per year and that 20% will be in children younger than age 20 years. Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of SCI in all ages. Falls are common causes in young children. The phenomenon of SCI without obvious radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) can be present in 20–40% of young children. Children from birth to 2 years tend to have high-level injuries to the cervical spine because of the anatomical features of the spine in this age group. The facets tend to be shallower and oriented horizontally, and the boney spine is more flexible than the spinal cord. In addition the head is disproportionately large and the neck muscles are weak. SCI are classified using the American Spinal Injury Asso- ciation classification (ASIA class). This classification evalu- ates motor and sensory function, defines the neurologic level of the injury, and assesses the completeness of the deficit. The 72-hour ASIA examination is used in predicting recov- ery. A complete lesion identified on ASIA examination at 72 hours predicts a very poor recovery potential. 1. ASIA class A is a complete spinal cord injury, with no motor or sensory function in the lowest sacral segments. 2. ASIA class B is an incomplete injury, with preserved sensory function but no motor function in the sacral segments. 3. ASIA class C is an incomplete lesion in which the strength of more than 50% of key muscles below the injury level is graded less than 3/5 on manual muscle testing. 4. ASIA class D is an incomplete lesion in which the strength of more than 50% of key muscles below the injury level is graded greater than 3/5 on manual muscle testing. 5. ASIA class E is an injury in which full motor and sensory function is preserved.  Clinical Findings A. Clinical Patterns of Spinal Cord Injury 1. Brown-Séquard injury—In this injury, the cord is hemi- sected, causing motor paralysis, loss of proprioception and vibration on the ipsilateral side and loss of pain and temper- ature on the contralateral side. 2. Central cord syndrome—Injury is to the central part of the cord and results in greater weakness in the arms than the legs. 3. Anterior cord syndrome—Disruption of the anterior spinal artery causes motor deficits and loss of pain and temperature sensation. 4. Conus medullaris syndrome—Injury or tumor of the conus causes minimal motor impairment but significant sensory and bowel and bladder abnormalities. 5. Cauda equina syndrome—Injury to the nerve roots produces flaccid bilateral weakness in the legs, sensory abnormalities in the perineum, and lower motor neuron bowel and bladder dysfunction.   REHABILITATION MEDICINE 793 2. Hypercalcemia—Hypercalcemia often occurs in male adolescents within the first 2 months of becoming paraplegic or tetraplegic. The serum calcium level rises significantly in response to immobilization. Patients complain of abdominal pain and malaise. Behavioral problems may occur. Initial treatment is focused on hydration and forced diuresis using fluids and furosemide to increase urinary excretion of cal- cium. In severe cases, especially in older children, calcitonin and etidronate may be required. 3. Thermoregulation problems—These problems are most common and most severe in higher level injuries and usually result in a poikilothermic state. The ability to vasoconstrict and vasodilate below the injury level is impaired. The person with an SCI above T6 is particularly susceptible to environmental tem- perature and is at risk for hypothermia and hyperthermia. 4. Deep vein thrombosis—Thrombosis is a common com- plication of SCI, especially in postpubescent children. Deep vein thrombosis should be suspected in children with any unilateral extremity swelling, palpable cords in the calf muscles, fevers, erythema, or leg pain. Diagnosis is confirmed by Doppler ultrasound, and full evaluation may require spiral CT scan or ventilation-perfusion scan if pulmonary embolus is suspected. Preventative measures include elastic stockings and compres- sion devices. Anticoagulation medications include heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin (0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours). 5. Heterotopic ossification—This complication occurs in both spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries. Ectopic cal- cium deposits usually appear around joints in the first 6 months after injury. They may cause swelling, decreased range of motion, pain with motion, palpable firm masses, fever, elevated sedimentation rate, and abnormal triple phase bone scan. Etidronate therapy should be started at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of ectopic deposits is contro- versial and usually performed only in cases of extreme loss of motion, pressure sores, or severe pain.

815,Brachial Plexus Lesions,Kidney & Urinary Tract ,2720,"BRACHIAL PLEXUS LESIONS  General Considerations The brachial plexus is the complex nervous connection between the spinal cord and the muscles of the upper extremity and scapular area. The nerve roots forming the plexus derive from the fifth cervical through the first thoracic nerves. These nerve roots form trunks that further divide into divisions and then into cords. The upper trunk (C5 and C6) is the most commonly injured, resulting in a symptom complex called Erb palsy. Injury to the lower trunk (C7–T1) produces Klumpke palsy. It is quite common for the entire brachial plexus to be involved. Mild brachial plexus injuries may produce only a nerve stretch or neurapraxia. Severe injury may cause complete avulsion of the nerve from the spinal cord.  Clinical Findings Erb palsy is characterized by shoulder weakness with internal rotation and adduction of the upper arm. The elbow is extended and the wrist flexed. There is good preservation of hand function. Klumpke palsy is characterized by good shoulder function but decreased or absent hand function. Brachial plexus injury may also cause Horner syndrome (unilateral miosis, ptosis and facial anhydrosis) due to dis- ruption of cervical sympathetic nerves. Associated bony and nerve injuries are common in brachial plexus injury. The physical examination should include inspection of the humerus and clavicle for fractures. There may be injuries of the phrenic and facial nerves. The diagnosis of a brachial plexus lesion should be based on the history and clinical examination. Diagnostic testing helps confirm, localize, and classify the lesion. Electromyog- raphy is helpful 3–4 weeks after the injury. This test not only is used diagnostically but can track recovery. MRI, myelog- raphy, and CT scan can help to locate the lesion and determine its extent.  Treatment & Prognosis Primary surgery to the nerves of the plexus is indicated for children who have no spontaneous recovery of biceps function by 6–9 months. Secondary procedures to maximize function include muscle transfers and orthopedic interventions. Physi- cal therapy is the major treatment for brachial plexus injury and includes stretching, bracing, and functional training. The currently accepted method of predicting recovery is based on the spontaneous recovery of the biceps. Children in whom antigravity function returns within 2 months of injury will probably have near-full recovery of function. If antigrav- ity function is delayed until 6 months after injury, recovery will probably be limited. If antigravity function is absent at 6–9 months after injury, there will be no recovery of function and surgical options to transplant muscles and improve motor function should be considered.

818,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,Kidney & Urinary Tract ,72,"JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Arthritis, involving pain, swelling, warmth, tenderness, morning stiffness, and decreased range of motion of one or more joints, lasting 6–12 weeks.  May have associated systemic manifestations, includ- ing fever, rash, uveitis, serositis, anemia, fatigue, and growth failure.  General Considerations There are three classifications of juvenile chronic arthritis. These different systems of categorizing patients attempt to standardize the diagnosis and approach to patient care as well as assist in designing research protocols. Each classifica- tion contains three main subtypes: pauciarticular or oligoar- ticular, polyarticular, and systemic (Table 27–1). The exact cause of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is not known, but there is substantial evidence that it is an autoimmune process with genetic susceptibility factors.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The most common type of JIA is the pauciarticular/oligoartic- ular form, which affects 50% of patients and is characterized by arthritis of four or fewer joints. This type of JIA often affects medium to large joints. Because the arthritis is often asymmet- rical, children may develop a leg-length discrepancy in which the involved leg grows longer due to increased blood flow and growth factors. The synovitis is usually mild and may be painless. Systemic features are uncommon except for inflam- mation in the eye. Up to 30% of children with this type of JIA develop insidious, asymptomatic uveitis, which may cause blindness if untreated. The activity of the eye disease does not correlate with that of the arthritis. Therefore, routine ophthal- mologic screening with slit-lamp examination must be per- formed at 3-month intervals if the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive, and at 6-month intervals if the ANA test is negative, for 4 years after the onset of arthritis. Polyarticular disease is defined as arthritis involving five or more joints. This type of JIA affects 35% of patients. Both large and small joints are involved, typically in a symmetrical pattern. Systemic features are not prominent, although low- grade fever, fatigue, rheumatoid nodules, and anemia may be present. This group is further divided into rheumatoid factor-positive (10%) and rheumatoid factor-negative (25%) disease. The former resembles adult rheumatoid arthritis with more chronic, destructive arthritis. The systemic form, also known as Still disease, is the least common form, comprising 10–15% of patients with JIA. The arthritis can involve any number of joints and affects both large and small joints, but may be absent at disease onset. One of the classic features is a high fever, often as high as 39– 40°C, typically occurring one to two times per day. In between fever spikes the temperature usually returns to normal or subnormal. Ninety percent of patients have a characteristic evanescent, salmon-pink macular rash that is most prominent on pressure areas and when fever is present. Other systemic features that may be present, but are not specific for JIA, include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenop- athy, leukocytosis, and serositis. B. Laboratory Findings There is no diagnostic test for JIA. A normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) does not exclude the diagnosis of JIA. However, patients with systemic JIA typically have significantly elevated markers of inflammation including ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, and platelets. Rheumatoid factor is positive in about 10–15% of patients, usually when onset of polyarticular disease occurs after age 8 years.

Triamcinolone hexacetonide is a long- acting steroid that can be used for injections and is often associated with at least several months of disease control. D. Uveitis Iridocyclitis should be closely monitored by an ophthalmol- ogist. Typically treatment is initiated with corticosteroid eye drops and dilating agents to prevent scarring between the iris and the lens. In patients who fail topical treatments, metho- trexate, cyclosporine, and infliximab may be used. E. Rehabilitation Physical and occupational therapy are important to focus on range of motion, stretching, and strengthening. These exer- cises, as well as other modalities such as heat, water therapy, and ultrasound, can help control pain, maintain and restore function, and prevent deformity and disability. Young chil- dren with oligoarticular disease affecting asymmetrical lower extremity joints can develop a leg-length discrepancy, which may require treatment with a shoe lift on the unaffected side.  Prognosis The course and prognosis for JIA is variable, depending on the subtype of disease. Overall, the prognosis is good; 75– 80% of patients remit without serious disability. In children with extended oligoarticular and polyarticular disease, more joints are involved; these patients may have more persistent and severe disease. Patients who are rheumatoid factor- positive are at highest risk for chronic, erosive arthritis that may continue into adulthood. The systemic features associ- ated with systemic arthritis tend to remit within months to years. The prognosis in systemic disease is worse in patients with persistent systemic disease after six months, thrombocy- tosis and more extensive arthritis.

Inflammation of tendinous insertions (enthesopathy), such as the tibial tubercle or the heel, occurs in these diseases and not in JIA. Low back pain and sacroiliitis are commonly seen in this form of arthritis. Carriage of HLA-B27 antigen occurs in approximately 80% of patients with this disorder. No autoantibodies are found, but inflammatory indicators such as an elevated ESR or CRP may be present. Acute, not chronic, uveitis may occur. NSAIDs, particularly indomethacin (2–4 mg/kg/d) and naproxen (15–20 mg/kg/d), are the first-line treatments for spondyloarthropathies. Refractory cases may respond to methotrexate, etanercept, or infliximab. Local corticosteroid injections are contraindicated in Achilles tendinitis.

Their unify- ing feature is the association of arthritis with preceding or concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. Reactive arthritis that follows diarrhea caused by Salmonella, Shigella, or Yersinia infection occurs with increased frequency in individuals who are HLA-B27–positive. The arthritis associated with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis usually begins after or concur- rent with active bowel disease. Other extraintestinal manifes- tations such as uveitis, stomatitis, hepatitis, and erythema nodosum may occur in these individuals. Treatment for the musculoskeletal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease, in addition to controlling the bowel disease, is primarily NSAIDs.

The arthritis associated with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis usually begins after or concur- rent with active bowel disease. Other extraintestinal manifes- tations such as uveitis, stomatitis, hepatitis, and erythema nodosum may occur in these individuals. Treatment for the musculoskeletal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease, in addition to controlling the bowel disease, is primarily NSAIDs. Patients who have per- sistent disease may require treatment with second-line agents such as methotrexate or infliximab (or both).

The spectrum of symptoms is due to tissue-specific autoantibodies, as well   RHEUMATIC DISEASES 799 injections may be helpful in patients who have arthritis in one or a few joints. Triamcinolone hexacetonide is a long- acting steroid that can be used for injections and is often associated with at least several months of disease control. D. Uveitis Iridocyclitis should be closely monitored by an ophthalmol- ogist. Typically treatment is initiated with corticosteroid eye drops and dilating agents to prevent scarring between the iris and the lens. In patients who fail topical treatments, metho- trexate, cyclosporine, and infliximab may be used. E. Rehabilitation Physical and occupational therapy are important to focus on range of motion, stretching, and strengthening. These exer- cises, as well as other modalities such as heat, water therapy, and ultrasound, can help control pain, maintain and restore function, and prevent deformity and disability. Young chil- dren with oligoarticular disease affecting asymmetrical lower extremity joints can develop a leg-length discrepancy, which may require treatment with a shoe lift on the unaffected side.  Prognosis The course and prognosis for JIA is variable, depending on the subtype of disease. Overall, the prognosis is good; 75– 80% of patients remit without serious disability. In children with extended oligoarticular and polyarticular disease, more joints are involved; these patients may have more persistent and severe disease. Patients who are rheumatoid factor- positive are at highest risk for chronic, erosive arthritis that may continue into adulthood. The systemic features associ- ated with systemic arthritis tend to remit within months to years. The prognosis in systemic disease is worse in patients with persistent systemic disease after six months, thrombocy- tosis and more extensive arthritis.

ENTHESITIS-RELATED ARTHRITIS  & SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY Lower extremity arthritis, particularly in males older than 10 years of age, suggests a form of spondyloarthropathy. Inflammation of tendinous insertions (enthesopathy), such as the tibial tubercle or the heel, occurs in these diseases and not in JIA. Low back pain and sacroiliitis are commonly seen in this form of arthritis. Carriage of HLA-B27 antigen occurs in approximately 80% of patients with this disorder. No autoantibodies are found, but inflammatory indicators such as an elevated ESR or CRP may be present. Acute, not chronic, uveitis may occur. NSAIDs, particularly indomethacin (2–4 mg/kg/d) and naproxen (15–20 mg/kg/d), are the first-line treatments for spondyloarthropathies. Refractory cases may respond to methotrexate, etanercept, or infliximab. Local corticosteroid injections are contraindicated in Achilles tendinitis. Unlike in adults, the disorder does not frequently progress to joint destruction or ankylosis in children. Hofer M: Spondyloarthropathies in children—are they different from those in adults?

The spectrum of symptoms is due to tissue-specific autoantibodies, as well   RHEUMATIC DISEASES 801 agent, such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or cyclo- phosphamide, should be added. More recently, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, has been used for persistent active disease, particularly in patients with hemato- logic manifestations. Patients who have evidence of antiphos- pholipid antibodies should be treated with a baby aspirin every day to help prevent thrombosis. Thrombotic events due to these clotting antibodies require long-term anticoagulation. The toxicities of the regimens must be carefully consid- ered. Growth failure, osteoporosis, Cushing syndrome, adre- nal suppression, and aseptic necrosis are serious side effects of chronic use of prednisone. When high doses of corticosteroids are used (> 2 mg/kg/d), there is a high risk of infection. Cyclophosphamide can cause bladder epithelial dysplasia, hemorrhagic cystitis, and sterility. Azathioprine has been asso- ciated with liver damage and bone marrow suppression. Immunosuppressant treatment should be withheld if the total white count falls below 3000/μL or the neutrophil count falls below 1000/μL. Retinal damage from hydroxychloroquine has not been observed with recommended dosages.  Course & Prognosis The prognosis in SLE relates to the presence of renal involve- ment or infectious complications of treatment. Nonetheless, the survival rate has improved from 51% at 5 years in 1954 to 90% today. The disease has a natural waxing and waning cycle; the disease may flare at any time and spontaneous remission may occur. Benseler SM, Silverman ED: Systemic lupus erythematosus.

823,Dermatomyositis,Kidney & Urinary Tract ,2056,"DERMATOMYOSITIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Pathognomonic skin rashes.  Weakness of proximal muscles and occasionally of pharyngeal and laryngeal groups.  Pathogenesis related to vasculitis.  General Considerations Dermatomyositis is a rare autoimmune disease of muscle and skin. The cause is unknown, but there are likely genetic and environmental factors predisposing to the condition. Small arteries and veins are involved, with infiltrates of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. The lesion progresses to intimal proliferation and thrombus formation. These vascular changes are found in the skin, muscle, kidney, retina, and gastrointestinal tract. Postin- flammatory calcinosis may occur.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The predominant symptom is proximal muscular weakness, particularly affecting pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. Tenderness, stiffness, and swelling may be found. Pharyngeal involvement, manifested as voice changes and difficulty swallowing, is associated with an increased risk of aspiration. Intestinal vasculitis can be associated with ulceration and perforation of involved areas. Flexion contractures and mus- cle atrophy may produce significant residual deformities. Calcinosis may follow the inflammation in muscle and skin. Several characteristic rashes are seen in dermatomyositis. Patients often have a heliotrope rash with a reddish-purple hue on the upper eyelids, along with a malar rash that may be accompanied by edema of the eyelids and face. Gottron papules are shiny, erythematous, scaly plaques on the extensor surfaces of the knuckles, elbows, and knees. Nail-fold abnormalities, including dilation, thrombosis, and dropout of periungual cap- illaries, may identify patients with a worse prognosis. B. Laboratory Findings Determination of muscle enzyme levels, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydro- genase, creatine phosphokinase, and aldolase, is helpful in confirming the diagnosis, assessing disease activity, and moni- toring the response to treatment. Even in the face of extensive muscle inflammation, the ESR and CRP are frequently normal. An MRI scan of the quadriceps muscle can be used in equivocal cases to confirm the presence of inflammatory myositis. Elec- tromyography is useful to distinguish myopathic from neuro- pathic causes of muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy is indicated in doubtful cases of myositis without the pathognomonic rash.  Treatment Treatment is aimed at suppression of the inflammatory response and prevention of the loss of muscle function and joint range of motion. Acutely, it is very important to assess the adequacy of the ventilatory effort and swallowing and to rule out intestinal vasculitis. Corticosteroids are the initial therapy of choice. Treatment is usually initiated with predni- sone, 2 mg/kg/d, and continued until signs and symptoms of active disease are controlled; the dosage is then gradually tapered. In severe cases, intravenous pulse methylpredniso- lone for 3 days is indicated. Therapy is guided by the physical examination findings and muscle enzyme values. Steroid ther- apy is generally maintained at the lowest dose possible for at   CHAPTER 27 802 least 2 years to minimize the risk of exacerbations and calcino- sis. If patients continue to have active disease, additional steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and in severe cases, cyclophosphamide, should be started. Hydroxychloroquine and intravenous immunoglobulin are particularly helpful in managing the skin manifestations. As the rashes are photosensitive, sun protection is very important. Physical and occupational therapy should be initiated early in the course of disease. Initially, passive range-of- motion exercises are performed to prevent loss motion. Later, once the muscle enzymes have normalized, a gradu- ated program of stretching and strengthening exercises is introduced to restore normal strength and function.  Course & Prognosis Most patients have a monocyclic course; 10–20% of patients have more chronic or recurrent symptoms. Factors that influ- ence the outcome include the rapidity of symptom onset, extent of weakness, presence of cutaneous or gastrointestinal vasculitis, timeliness of diagnosis, initiation of therapy, and response to treatment.

824,Polyarteritis Nodosa,Neurologic & Muscular Disorders ,1832,"POLYARTERITIS NODOSA Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare disease, but a significant number of cases have been reported in childhood and infancy. No single cause has been found, but some series have reported an association with infectious triggers, includ- ing Streptococcus, hepatitis B, and parvovirus. PAN is a multisystem disease that may manifest with fever, purpura, painful nodules, weight loss, myalgias, arthralgias, tingling, numbness, proteinuria or hematuria, hypertension, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Patients may also have central nervous system and cardiac involvement. Patients with isolated cutaneous disease present with painful nodules that have a predilection for the lower legs and feet. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsies of involved tissues or arteriography demonstrating microaneurysms, stenosis, and dilation. Pathologically, the disease is a vasculitis of medium- sized arteries. Fibrosis of vessels and surrounding tissues accompanies the healing stages. Treatment consists of prednisone and often requires other immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, azathio- prine, or cyclophosphamide. Isolated cutaneous disease can usually be managed with NSAIDs alone or with a short course of corticosteroids. Kim S, Dedeoglu F: Update on pediatric vasculitis.

SCLERODERMA Fortunately, the most common forms of scleroderma in childhood are localized morphea lesions and linear sclero- derma, not the systemic disease. The skin disease begins as indurated, hyperpigmented or hypopigmented plaques (mor- phea) or linear bands (linear scleroderma) and ultimately leads to thickening and scarring of the involved areas. Patients may develop subcutaneous and muscular atrophy and joint contractures in underlying joints. Localized treat- ment with topical vitamin D analogues and ultraviolet light may be beneficial. Treatment with corticosteroids and meth- otrexate helps to limit extension of the disease and prevent the development of new lesions. Typically without treat- ment, the skin lesions progress over a 1–2-year period and then remit. No treatment is available to reverse the residual scarred areas; however, the skin tends to soften and develop more normal pigmentation over time. In systemic sclerosis, the dermal process is generalized. Raynaud phenomenon is almost invariably present. Arthral- gias, esophageal dysfunction, and renal disease are associated with systemic sclerosis. Involvement of the lungs, heart, and kidneys may lead to rapid deterioration. Supportive treat- ments should be initiated for the skin manifestations, Raynaud phenomenon, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Sys- temic immunosuppressant medications such as corticoster- oids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide are used with variable response.

826,Normal Hematologic Values,Neurologic & Muscular Disorders ,90,"NORMAL HEMATOLOGIC VALUES The normal ranges for peripheral blood counts vary signifi- cantly with age. Normal neonates show a relative polycythe- mia with a hematocrit concentration of 45–65%. The reticulo- cyte count at birth is relatively high at 2–8%. Within the first few days of life, erythrocyte production decreases, and the values for hemoglobin and hematocrit fall to a nadir at about 6–8 weeks. During this period, known as physiologic anemia of infancy, normal infants have hemoglobin values as low as 10 g/dL and hematocrits as low as 30%. Thereafter, the normal values for hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually increase until adult values are reached after puberty. Premature infants can reach a nadir hemoglobin level of 7–8 g/dL at 8–10 weeks. Newborns have larger red cells than children and adults, with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) at birth of more than 94 fL. The MCV subsequently falls to a nadir of 70–84 fL at about age 6 months. Thereafter, the normal MCV increases gradually until it reaches adult values after puberty. The normal number of white blood cells is higher in infancy and early childhood than later in life. Neutrophils predominate in the differential white count at birth and in the older child. Lymphocytes predominate (up to 80%) between about ages 1 month and 6 years. Normal values for the platelet count are 150,000– 400,000/μL and vary little with age. BONE MARROW FAILURE Failure of the marrow to produce adequate numbers of circulating blood cells may be congenital or acquired and may cause pancytopenia (aplastic anemia) or involve only one cell line (single cytopenia). Constitutional and acquired aplastic anemias are discussed in this section and the more common single cytopenias in later sections. Bone marrow failure caused by malignancy or other infiltrative disease is discussed in Chapter 29. It is important to remember that many drugs and toxins may affect the marrow and cause single or multiple cytopenias. Suspicion of bone marrow failure is warranted in children with pancytopenia and in children with single cytopenias who lack evidence of peripheral red cell, white cell, or platelet destruction. Macrocytosis often accompanies bone marrow failure. Many of the constitutional bone marrow disorders are associated with a variety of congenital anomalies.

Inheritance is autosomal recessive, and the disease occurs in all ethnic groups. Hematologic manifestations usually begin with thrombocytopenia or neutropenia and subsequently progress over the course of months or years to pancytopenia.

Normal values for the platelet count are 150,000– 400,000/μL and vary little with age. "
826,Bone Marrow Failure,Neurologic & Muscular Disorders ,1487,"BONE MARROW FAILURE Failure of the marrow to produce adequate numbers of circulating blood cells may be congenital or acquired and may cause pancytopenia (aplastic anemia) or involve only one cell line (single cytopenia). Constitutional and acquired aplastic anemias are discussed in this section and the more common single cytopenias in later sections. Bone marrow failure caused by malignancy or other infiltrative disease is discussed in Chapter 29. It is important to remember that many drugs and toxins may affect the marrow and cause single or multiple cytopenias. Suspicion of bone marrow failure is warranted in children with pancytopenia and in children with single cytopenias who lack evidence of peripheral red cell, white cell, or platelet destruction. Macrocytosis often accompanies bone marrow failure. Many of the constitutional bone marrow disorders are associated with a variety of congenital anomalies. CONSTITUTIONAL APLASTIC  ANEMIA (FANCONI ANEMIA) ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Progressive pancytopenia.  Macrocytosis.  Multiple congenital anomalies.  Increased chromosome breakage in peripheral blood lymphocytes.  General Considerations Fanconi anemia is a syndrome characterized by defective DNA repair that is caused by a variety of genetic mutations. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, and the disease occurs in all ethnic groups. Hematologic manifestations usually begin with thrombocytopenia or neutropenia and subsequently progress over the course of months or years to pancytopenia. Typically the diagnosis is made between ages 2 and 10 years.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Symptoms are determined principally by the degree of hema- tologic abnormality. Thrombocytopenia may cause purpura,   Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use.    CHAPTER 28 806  General Considerations Acquired aplastic anemia is characterized by peripheral pancy- topenia with a hypocellular bone marrow. Approximately 50% of cases in childhood are idiopathic. Other cases are secondary to idiosyncratic reactions to drugs such as phenylbu- tazone, sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticonvulsants. Toxic causes include exposure to ben- zene, insecticides, and heavy metals. Infectious causes include viral hepatitis (usually non-A, non-B, non-C), infectious mononucleosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In immunocompromised children, aplastic anemia has been associated with human parvovirus B19. Immune mechanisms of marrow suppression are suspected in most cases.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Weakness, fatigue, and pallor result from anemia; petechiae, purpura, and bleeding occur because of thrombocytopenia; and fevers due to generalized or localized infections are associated with neutropenia. Hepatosplenomegaly and sig- nificant lymphadenopathy are unusual. B. Laboratory Findings Anemia is usually normocytic, with a low reticulocyte count. The white blood cell count is low, with a marked neutrope- nia. The platelet count is typically below 50,000/μL, and is frequently below 20,000/μL. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy show hypocellularity, often marked.   Differential Diagnosis Examination of the bone marrow usually excludes pancy- topenia caused by peripheral destruction of blood cells or by infiltrative processes such as acute leukemia, storage dis- eases, and myelofibrosis. Many of these other conditions are associated with hepatosplenomegaly. Preleukemic condi- tions also may present with pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrows. Cytogenetic analysis of the marrow is helpful, because a clonal abnormality may predict the subsequent development of leukemia. Since congenital anomalies may not be apparent in some children with Fanconi anemia, patients with newly diagnosed aplastic anemia should be studied for chromosome breaks and rearrangements in peripheral blood lymphocytes.  Complications Acquired aplastic anemia is characteristically complicated by infection and hemorrhage, which are the leading causes of death. Other complications are those associated with therapy.  Treatment Comprehensive supportive care is most important in the management of acute acquired aplastic anemia. Febrile ill- nesses require prompt evaluation and usually parenteral antibiotics. Red blood cell transfusions alleviate symptoms of anemia. Platelet transfusions may be lifesaving, but they should be used sparingly because many patients eventually develop platelet alloantibodies and become refractory to platelet transfusions. Bone marrow transplantation is generally considered the treatment of choice for severe aplastic anemia when an HLA- compatible sibling donor is available. Because the likelihood of success with transplantation is influenced adversely by multiple transfusions, HLA typing of family members should be undertaken as soon as the diagnosis of aplastic anemia is made. Increasingly patients who lack HLA-matched siblings are able to find matched donors through cord blood banks or the National Marrow Donor Program. An alternative to bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor is immunomodulation, usually with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine. Responses are very good. Most patients show hematologic improve- ment and become transfusion-independent.  Prognosis Children receiving early bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling have a long-term survival rate of greater than 80%. Sustained, complete remissions may be seen in 65–80% of patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. However, both therapies are associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndromes, acute leuke- mia, and other malignancies in long-term survivors.

828,Anemias,Neurologic & Muscular Disorders ,4582,"ANEMIAS APPROACH TO THE CHILD WITH ANEMIA Anemia is a relatively common finding, and identifying the cause is important. Even though anemia in childhood has many causes, the correct diagnosis can usually be established with relatively little laboratory cost. Frequently the cause is identified with a careful history. The possibility of nutri- tional causes should be addressed by inquiry about dietary intake; growth and development; and symptoms of chronic disease, malabsorption, or blood loss. Hemolytic disease may    CHAPTER 28 824  Complications The anemia may be very severe and result in cardiovascular collapse, requiring emergency management. The complica- tions of an underlying disease, such as disseminated lupus erythematosus or an immunodeficiency state, may be present.  Treatment Medical management of the underlying disease is important in symptomatic cases. Defining the clinical syndrome pro- vides a useful guide to treatment. Most patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (in which hemolysis is mostly extravascular) respond to prednisone (2–4 mg/kg/d). After the initial treatment, the dose of corticosteroids may be decreased slowly. Patients may respond to 1 g of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) per kilogram per day for 2 days, but fewer patients respond to IVIG than to prednisone. Although the rate of remission with splenectomy may be as high as 50%, particularly in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, this should be carefully considered in younger patients and withheld until other treatments have failed. In severe cases unresponsive to more conventional therapy, immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, aza- thioprine, busulfan, and cyclosporine may be tried alone or in combination with corticosteroids. In refractory cases, rituximab may be a successful alternative, and transplanta- tion has been used in a small number of cases. Patients with cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria are less likely to respond to corticosteroids or IVIG. Because these syndromes are most apt to be associated with infections and have an acute, self- limited course, supportive care may be sufficient. Plasma exchange may be effective in severe cold autoimmune (IgM) hemolytic anemia because the offending antibody has an intravascular distribution. Supportive therapy is crucial. Patients with cold-reacting antibodies, particularly paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, should be kept in a warm environment. Transfusion may be necessary because of the complications of severe anemia but should be used only when there is no alternative. In most patients, cross-match compatible blood will not be found, and the least incompatible unit should be identified. Trans- fusion must be conducted carefully, beginning with a test dose (see Transfusion Medicine section, later in this chap- ter). Identification of the patient’s phenotype for minor red cell alloantigens may be helpful in avoiding alloimmuniza- tion or in providing appropriate transfusions if alloantibod- ies arise after initial transfusions. Patients with severe intra- vascular hemolysis may have associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and heparin therapy should be considered in such cases.  Prognosis The outlook for autoimmune hemolytic anemia in child- hood usually is good unless associated diseases are present (eg, congenital immunodeficiency, AIDS, lupus erythemato- sus), in which case hemolysis is likely to have a chronic course. In general, children with warm autoimmune hemo- lytic anemia are at greater risk for more severe and chronic disease with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Hemolysis and positive antiglobulin tests may continue for months or years. Patients with cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria are more likely to have acute, self-limited disease (< 3 months). Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria is almost always associated with infection (eg, Mycoplasma infection, CMV, and EBV). Naithani R: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in children.

Nonimmune Acquired Hemolytic Anemia Hepatic disease may alter the lipid composition of the red cell membrane. This usually results in the formation of target cells and is not associated with significant hemolysis. Occasionally, hepatocellular damage is associated with the formation of spur cells and brisk hemolytic anemia. Renal disease may also be associated with significant hemol- ysis; hemolytic-uremic syndrome is one example. In this disorder, hemolysis is associated with the presence, on the peripheral blood smear, of echinocytes, helmet cells, frag- mented red cells, and spherocytes. A microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with fragmented red cells and some spherocytes may be observed in several conditions associated with intravascular coagulation and fibrin deposition within vessels. This occurs with DIC such as may complicate severe infection, but it may also occur when the intravascular coagulation is localized, as with giant cavernous hemangiomas (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome). Fragmented red cells may also be seen with mechanical damage (eg, associated with artificial heart valves). "

848,Disorders of Leukocytes,Orthopedics ,17,"DISORDERS OF LEUKOCYTES NEUTROPENIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Increased frequency of infections.  Ulceration of oral mucosa and gingivitis.  Normal numbers of red cells and platelets.  General Considerations Neutropenia is an absolute neutrophil (granulocyte) count of less than 1500/μL in childhood, or below 1000/μL be- tween ages 1 week and 2 years. During the first few days of life, an absolute neutrophil count of less than 3500 cells/μL may be considered neutropenia. Neutropenia results from absent or defective granulocyte stem cells, ineffective or suppressed myeloid maturation, decreased production of hematopoietic cytokines (eg, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulat- ing factor [GM-CSF]), decreased marrow release, increased neutrophil destruction or consumption, or, in pseudo- neutropenia, from an increased neutrophil marginating pool (Table 28–5). The most severe types of congenital neutropenia include reticular dysgenesis (congenital aleukocytosis), Kostmann syndrome (severe neutropenia with maturation defect in the marrow progenitor cells), Shwachman syndrome (neutrope- nia with pancreatic insufficiency), neutropenia with immune deficiency states, cyclic neutropenia, and myelokathexis or dysgranulopoiesis. Genetic mutations for Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, Kostmann and Shwachman syndromes, and cyclic neutropenia have been identified. Neutropenia may also be associated with storage and metabolic diseases and immunodeficiency states. The most common causes of neu- tropenia are viral infection or drugs resulting in decreased neutrophil production in the marrow or increased destruc- tion or both. Severe bacterial infections may be associated with neutropenia. Although rare, neonatal alloimmune neu- tropenia can be severe and associated with risk for infection. Autoimmune neutropenia in the mother can result in pas- sive transfer of antibody to the fetus and neutropenia in the neonate. Malignancies, osteopetrosis, marrow failure syn- dromes, and hypersplenism usually are not associated with isolated neutropenia.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Acute severe bacterial or fungal infection is the most signifi- cant complication of neutropenia. Although the risk is increased when the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500/ μL, the actual susceptibility is variable and depends on the cause of neutropenia, marrow reserves, and other factors. The most common types of infection include septicemia, cellulitis, skin abscesses, pneumonia, and perirectal abscesses. Sinusitis, aphthous ulcers, gingivitis, and periodontal disease also cause significant problems. In addition to local signs and symptoms, patients may have chills, fever, and malaise. In most cases, the spleen and liver are not enlarged. Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria are the most common pathogens. B. Laboratory Findings Neutrophils are absent or markedly reduced in the periph- eral blood smear. In most forms of neutropenia or agranulo- cytosis, the monocytes and lymphocytes are normal and the red cells and platelets are not affected. The bone marrow usually shows a normal erythroid series, with adequate megakaryocytes, but a marked reduction in the myeloid cells or a significant delay in maturation of this series may be noted. Total cellularity may be decreased. In the evaluation of neutropenia (eg, persistent, intermit- tent, cyclic), attention should be paid to the duration and pattern of neutropenia, the types of infections and their frequency, and phenotypic abnormalities on physical exam-  Table 28–5.

The ratio then reverses gradually to reach the adult pattern of neutrophil predominance. An absolute lymphocytosis in childhood is associated with acute or chronic viral infections, pertussis, syphilis, tuberculosis, and hyperthyroidism. Other noninfectious conditions, drugs, and hypersensitivity and serum sickness–like reactions cause lymphocytosis. Fever, upper respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal complaints, and rashes are clues in distinguishing infec- tious from noninfectious causes. The presence of enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes is crucial to the differential diagnosis, which includes acute leukemia and lymphoma. Most cases of infectious mononucleosis are associated with hepatosplenomegaly or adenopathy. The absence of anemia and thrombocytopenia helps to differentiate these disor- ders. Evaluation of the morphology of lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear is crucial. Infectious causes, partic- ularly infectious mononucleosis, are associated with atypi- cal features in the lymphocytes such as basophilic cyto- plasm, vacuoles, finer and less-dense chromatin, and an indented nucleus. These features are distinct from the characteristic morphology associated with lymphoblastic leukemia. Lymphocytosis in childhood is most commonly associated with infections and resolves with recovery from the primary disease. EOSINOPHILIA Eosinophilia in infants and children is an absolute eosinophil count greater than 300/μL. Marrow eosinophil production is stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-5. Allergies, particu- larly eczema, are the most common primary causes of eosinophilia in children. Eosinophilia also occurs in drug reactions, with tumors (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lym- phomas and brain tumors), and with immunodeficiency and histiocytosis syndromes. Increased eosinophil counts are a prominent feature of many invasive parasitic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders such as chronic hepatitis, ulcer- ative colitis, Crohn disease, and milk precipitin disease may be associated with eosinophilia. Increased blood eosinophil counts have been identified in several families without asso- ciation with any specific illness. Rare causes of eosinophilia include the hypereosinophilic syndrome, characterized by counts greater than 1500/μL and organ involvement and damage (hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis, and central nervous system injury). This is a disor- der of middle-aged adults and is rare in children. Eosino- philic leukemia has been described, but its existence as a distinct entity is controversial. Eosinophils are sometimes the last type of mature mye- loid cell to disappear after marrow ablative chemotherapy. Increased eosinophil counts are associated with graft-versus- host disease after bone marrow transplantation, and eleva- tions are sometimes documented during rejection episodes in patients who have solid organ grafts.

852,Bleeding Disorders,Orthopedics ,3038,"BLEEDING DISORDERS Bleeding disorders may occur as a result of (1) quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of platelets, (2) quantitative or qual- itative abnormalities in plasma procoagulant factors, (3) vas- cular abnormalities, or (4) accelerated fibrinolysis. The coagu- lation cascade and fibrinolytic system are shown in Figures 28–4 and 28–5. The most critical aspect in evaluating the bleeding patient is obtaining detailed personal and family bleeding histories, including bleeding complications associated with dental interventions, surgeries, suture placement and removal, and trauma. Excessive mucosal bleeding is suggestive of a platelet disorder, von Willebrand disease, dysfibrinogenemia, or vas- culitis. Bleeding into muscles and joints may be associated with a plasma procoagulant factor abnormality. In either scenario, the abnormality may be congenital or acquired.

From 25–50% of those affected develop renal involvement in the second or third week of illness with either a nephritic or, less commonly, nephrotic picture. Hypertension may accompany the renal involvement. In males, testicular torsion may also occur, and neurologic symp- toms are possible due to small vessel vasculitis. B. Laboratory Findings The platelet count is normal or elevated, and other screening tests of hemostasis and platelet function are typically normal. Urinalysis frequently reveals hematuria, and sometimes pro- teinuria. Stool may be positive for occult blood. The anti- streptolysin O (ASO) titer is often elevated and the throat culture positive for group A β-hemolytic streptococci. Serum IgA may be elevated.  Differential Diagnosis The rash of septicemia (especially meningococcemia) may be similar to skin involvement in HSP, although the distribu- tion tends to be more generalized. The possibility of trauma should be considered in any child presenting with purpura. Other vasculitides should also be considered. The lesions of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are not palpable.  Treatment Generally, treatment is supportive. NSAIDs may be useful for the arthritis. Corticosteroid therapy may provide symptomatic relief for severe gastrointestinal or joint manifestations but does not alter skin or renal manifestations. If culture for group A β-hemolytic streptococci is positive or if the ASO titer is elevated, a therapeutic course of penicillin is warranted.  Prognosis The prognosis for recovery is generally good, although symptoms frequently (25–50%) recur over a period of sev- eral months. In patients who develop renal manifestations, microscopic hematuria may persist for years. Progressive renal failure occurs in less than 5% of patients with HSP, with an overall fatality rate of 3%.

Collagen Disorders Mild to life-threatening bleeding occurs with some types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the most common inherited col- lagen disorder. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized by joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and easy bruising. Coagulation abnormalities may sometimes be present, includ- ing platelet dysfunction and deficiencies of coagulation factors VIII, IX, XI, and XIII. However, bleeding and easy bruising, in most instances, relates to fragility of capillaries and compro- mised vascular integrity. Individuals with Ehlers-Danlos syn- drome types 4 and 6 are at risk for aortic dissection and spontaneous rupture of aortic aneurysms. Surgery should be avoided for patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, as should medications that induce platelet dysfunction.

864,Thrombotic Disorders,Orthopedics ,2984,"THROMBOTIC DISORDERS  General Considerations Although uncommon in children, thrombotic disorders are being recognized with increasing frequency, particularly with heightened physician awareness and improved survival in pediatric intensive care settings. Several clinical conditions have a potential association with thrombotic events in child- hood (see Clinical Risk Factors, below).  Clinical Findings Initial evaluation of the child who has thrombosis includes an assessment for potential triggering factors, as well as a family history of thrombosis and early cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. A. Clinical Risk Factors Clinical risk factors are present in more than 90% of children with acute venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). These conditions include the presence of an indwelling vascular catheter, cardiac disease, malignancy, infection, trauma, sur- gery, immobilization, collagen-vascular or chronic inflam- matory disease, renal disease, and sickle cell anemia.  1. Inherited thrombophilia (hypercoagulability) states a. Protein C deficiency—Protein C is a vitamin K– dependent protein that is normally activated by thrombin bound to thrombomodulin and inactivates activated factors V and VIII. In addition, activated protein C promotes fibrinolysis. Two phenotypes of hereditary protein C defi- ciency exist. Heterozygous individuals with autosomal dom- inant protein C deficiency often present with VTEs as young adults, but the disorder may manifest during childhood or in later adulthood. In the absence of VTEs, prophylaxis is limited to periods of increased prothrombotic risk. Homozy- gous or compound heterozygous protein C deficiency is rare but phenotypically severe. Affected children generally pres- ent within the first 12 hours of life with purpura fulminans and/or VTEs. Retinal thrombosis may result in blindness. Prompt protein C replacement by infusion of FFP every 6– 12 hours, or of protein C concentrate (if available), along with therapeutic heparin administration is recommended.

867,Splenic Abnormalities,Orthopedics ,194,"SPLENIC ABNORMALITIES SPLENOMEGALY & HYPERSPLENISM The differential diagnosis of splenomegaly includes the gen- eral categories of congestive splenomegaly, chronic infec- tions, leukemia and lymphomas, hemolytic anemias, reticu- loendothelioses, and storage diseases (Table 28–9). Splenomegaly due to any cause may be associated with hypersplenism and the excessive destruction of circulating red cells, white cells, and platelets. The degree of cytopenia is variable and, when mild, requires no specific therapy. In other cases, the thrombocytopenia may cause life-threatening bleed- ing, particularly when the splenomegaly is secondary to portal hypertension and associated with esophageal varices or the consequence of a storage disease. In such cases, treatment with surgical splenectomy or with splenic embolization may be warranted. Although more commonly associated with acute enlargement, rupture of an enlarged spleen can be seen in more chronic conditions such as Gaucher disease. Stone DL: Life threatening splenic hemorrhage in two patients with Gaucher’s disease. Am J Hematol 2000;64:140 [PMID: 10814997]. ASPLENIA & SPLENECTOMY Children who lack normal splenic function are at risk for sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia due to encapsulated bacte- ria such as pneumococci and H influenzae. Such infections are often fulminant and fatal because of inadequate antibody production and impaired phagocytosis of circulating bacteria. Congenital asplenia is usually suspected when an infant is born with abnormalities of abdominal viscera and complex cyanotic congenital heart disease. Howell-Jolly bodies are usually present on the peripheral blood smear, and the absence of splenic tissue is confirmed by technetium radio- nuclide scanning. The prognosis depends on the underlying cardiac lesions, and many children die during the first few months. Prophylactic antibiotics, usually penicillin, and pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines are recommended. The risk of overwhelming sepsis following surgical sple- nectomy is related to the child’s age and to the underlying disorder. Because the risk is highest when the procedure is performed earlier in life, splenectomy is usually postponed until after age 5 years. The risk of postsplenectomy sepsis is also greater in children with malignancies, thalassemias, and reticuloendothelioses than in children whose splenectomy is performed for ITP, hereditary spherocytosis, or trauma. Prior to splenectomy, children should be immunized against Streptococcus pneumoniae, H influenzae, and Neisseria menin- gitidis. Additional management should include penicillin Table 28–9.

Greffe, MD Nicholas K. Foreman, MD  Doug K. Graham, MD, PhD Roger H. Giller, MD  Ralph R. Quinones, MD Amy K. Keating, MD Each year approximately 150 of every 1 million children younger than age 20 years are diagnosed with cancer. For children between the ages of 1 and 20 years, cancer is the fourth leading cause of death, behind unintentional injuries, homicides, and suicides. However, combined-modality ther- apy, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation ther- apy, has improved survival dramatically, such that the over- all 5-year survival rate of pediatric malignancies is now greater than 75%. It is estimated that by the year 2020, 1 in 600 adults will be a survivor of childhood cancer. Because pediatric malignancies are rare, cooperative clin- ical trials have become the mainstay of treatment planning and therapeutic advances. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), representing the amalgamation of four prior pediat- ric cooperative groups (Children’s Cancer Group, Pediatric Oncology Group, Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group, and the National Wilms Tumor Study Group), offers current therapeutic protocols and strives to answer impor- tant treatment questions. A child or adolescent newly diag- nosed with cancer should be enrolled in a cooperative clinical trial whenever possible. Because many protocols are associated with significant toxicities, morbidity, and poten- tial mortality, treatment of children with cancer should be supervised by a pediatric oncologist familiar with the hazards of treatment, preferably at a multidisciplinary pediatric can- cer center. Advances in molecular genetics, cell biology, and tumor immunology have contributed and are crucial to the contin- ued understanding of pediatric malignancies and their treat- ment. Continued research into the biology of tumors will lead to the identification of targeted therapy for specific tumor types with, it is hoped, fewer systemic effects. Research in supportive care areas, such as prevention and management of infection, pain, and emesis, has improved the survival and quality of life for children undergoing cancer treatment. Long-term studies of childhood cancer survivors are yielding information that provides a rationale for modifying future treatment regimens to decrease mor- bidity. A guide for caring for childhood cancer survivors is now available to medical providers as well as families and details suggested examinations and late effects by type of chemotherapy received.

Keating, MD Each year approximately 150 of every 1 million children younger than age 20 years are diagnosed with cancer. For children between the ages of 1 and 20 years, cancer is the fourth leading cause of death, behind unintentional injuries, homicides, and suicides. However, combined-modality ther- apy, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation ther- apy, has improved survival dramatically, such that the over- all 5-year survival rate of pediatric malignancies is now greater than 75%. It is estimated that by the year 2020, 1 in 600 adults will be a survivor of childhood cancer. Because pediatric malignancies are rare, cooperative clin- ical trials have become the mainstay of treatment planning and therapeutic advances. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), representing the amalgamation of four prior pediat- ric cooperative groups (Children’s Cancer Group, Pediatric Oncology Group, Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group, and the National Wilms Tumor Study Group), offers current therapeutic protocols and strives to answer impor- tant treatment questions. A child or adolescent newly diag- nosed with cancer should be enrolled in a cooperative clinical trial whenever possible. Because many protocols are associated with significant toxicities, morbidity, and poten- tial mortality, treatment of children with cancer should be supervised by a pediatric oncologist familiar with the hazards of treatment, preferably at a multidisciplinary pediatric can- cer center. Advances in molecular genetics, cell biology, and tumor immunology have contributed and are crucial to the contin- ued understanding of pediatric malignancies and their treat- ment. Continued research into the biology of tumors will lead to the identification of targeted therapy for specific tumor types with, it is hoped, fewer systemic effects. Research in supportive care areas, such as prevention and management of infection, pain, and emesis, has improved the survival and quality of life for children undergoing cancer treatment. Long-term studies of childhood cancer survivors are yielding information that provides a rationale for modifying future treatment regimens to decrease mor- bidity. A guide for caring for childhood cancer survivors is now available to medical providers as well as families and details suggested examinations and late effects by type of chemotherapy received.

Due to the immunocompromised state of the patient with ALL, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections are serious and can be life-threatening or fatal. During the course of treatment, fever (temperature = 38.3°C) and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/μL) require prompt assessment, blood cultures from each lumen of a central line, and prompt treatment with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients receiving ALL treatment must receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis carinii). Tri- methoprim–sulfamethoxazole given twice each day on 2 or 3 consecutive days per week is the drug of choice. Patients nonimmune to varicella are at risk for very serious—even fatal—infection. Such patients should receive varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) within 72 hours after exposure and treatment with intravenous acyclovir for active infection.  Prognosis Cure rates depend on specific prognostic features present at diagnosis, biologic features of the leukemic blast, and the response to therapy. Two of the most important features are WBC count and age. Children aged 1–9 years whose diag- nostic WBC count is less than 50,000/μL have a higher rate of cure than other patients (~85% event-free survival for these children). The rapidity of response to induction treat- ment has prognostic significance as well, reflecting leukemic blast sensitivity to chemotherapy. Patients are categorized as rapid early responders (RERs) or slow early responders (SERs) based on the percentage of blasts present in bone marrow aspirates within 7–14 days after induction begins. More intensive treatment regimens are given to SERs than RERs to increase their chance of cure. Certain chromosomal abnormalities present in the leuke- mic blasts at diagnosis influence prognosis. Patients with t(9;22) generally have a very poor chance of cure even with intensive chemotherapy. Likewise, infants younger than age 6 months with t(4;11) have a poor chance of cure with conventional chemotherapy. In contrast, patients whose blasts are hyperdiploid (containing > 50 chromosomes instead of the normal 46) with trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17, and patients whose blasts have a t(12;21) and TEL-AML1 rearrangement have a greater chance of cure, approaching 90% survival, than do children without these characteristics. Techniques based on leukemic blast immunophenotyp- ing or immunoglobulin rearrangements have been devel- oped to detect residual lymphoblasts in bone marrow (MRD), at the end of induction and during remission. Many groups have shown that even low levels of MRD predict an inferior outcome. In the current COG clinical trials, patients with levels of MRD above 0.1% at the end of remission induction will receive intensified therapy, in an attempt to improve their outcome.

878,Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Orthopedics ,3447,"ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy shows 20% or more leukemic blasts.  Fatigue, bleeding, or infection.  Adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, skin nodules (M4 and M5 subtypes).  Cytopenias: neutropenia (69%), anemia (44%), throm- bocytopenia (33%).  General Considerations Approximately 500 new cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occur per year in children and adolescents in the United States. Although AML accounts for only 25% of all leukemias in this age group, it is responsible for at least one third of deaths from leukemia in children and teenagers. Congenital conditions associated with an increased risk of AML include Diamond-Blackfan anemia; neurofibromato- sis; Down syndrome; Wiskott-Aldrich, Kostmann, and Li- Fraumeni syndromes; as well as chromosomal instability syndromes such as Fanconi anemia. Acquired risk factors include exposure to ionizing radiation, cytotoxic chemo- therapeutic agents, and benzenes. However, the vast majority of patients have no identifiable risk factors. His- torically, the diagnosis of AML was based almost exclu- sively on morphology and immunohistochemical staining of the leukemic cells. AML has eight subtypes (M0–M7) according to the French-American-British (FAB) classifi- cation (Table 29–1). Immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses are increasingly important in confirm- ing the diagnosis of AML and subclassifying it into biolog- ically distinct subtypes that have therapeutic and prognos- tic implications. Cytogenetic clonal abnormalities occur in 80% of patients with AML and are often predictive of outcome. Aggressive induction therapy currently results in a 75– 85% complete remission rate. However, long-term survival has improved only modestly to approximately 50%, despite   CHAPTER 29 858 this subtype of AML with favorable results. This subtype has an increased event-free survival over other AML subtypes. Another biologically distinct subtype of AML occurs in children with Down syndrome, M7, or megakaryocytic AML. Using less intensive treatment, remission induction rate and overall survival of these children are dramatically superior to non–Down syndrome children with AML. It is important that children with Down syndrome receive appro- priate treatment specifically designed to be less intensive. Biologic agents and new chemotherapeutic agents are increasingly being studied in the treatment of AML. The development and early success of antibody-targeted cyto- toxic agents such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated with calicheamicin) are encouraging steps in the quest for therapeutic agents that result in higher survival rates. Use of this agent as intensive chemotherapy for AML is now being evaluated in a randomized trial. Clofarabine, a newer nucle- oside analogue, also has activity in AML and is currently undergoing trials in relapsed and refractory patients. B. Supportive Care Tumor lysis syndrome rarely occurs during induction treat- ment of AML. Nevertheless, when the diagnostic WBC cell count is greater than 100,000/μL or significant adenopathy or organomegaly is present, one should alkalinize urine with intravenous sodium bicarbonate, maintain brisk urine out- put, and follow potassium, uric acid, and phosphorous lab values closely. Hyperleukocytosis (WBC > 100,000/μL) is a medical emergency and, in a symptomatic patient, requires rapid intervention such as leukophoresis to rapidly decrease the number of circulating blasts and thereby decrease hyper- viscosity. Delaying transfusion of packed RBCs until the WBC can be decreased to below 100,000/μL avoids exacer- bating hyperviscosity. It is also important to correct the coagulopathy commonly associated with M3, M4, or M5 subtypes prior to beginning induction chemotherapy. As with the treatment of ALL, all blood products should be irradiated and leukodepleted; Pneumocystis prophylaxis must be administered during treatment and for several weeks afterward; and patients not immune to varicella must receive VZIG within 72 hours of exposure and prompt treatment with intravenous acyclovir for active infection. Onset of fever (temperature ≥ 38.3°C) or chills associated with neutropenia requires prompt assessment, blood cultures from each lumen of a central venous line, other cultures such as throat or urine as appropriate, and prompt initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Infections in this population of patients can rapidly become life-threatening. Because of the high incidence of invasive fungal infections, there should be a low threshold for initiating antifungal therapy. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) may be used to stimulate granulocyte recovery during the treatment of AML and results in shorter periods of neutrope- nia and hospitalization. It must be stressed that the supportive care for this group of patients is as important as the leukemia- directed therapy and that this treatment should be carried out only at a tertiary pediatric cancer center.  Prognosis Published results from various centers show a 50–60% sur- vival rate at 5 years following first remission for patients who do not have matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell donors. Patients with matched sibling donors fare slightly better, with 5-year survival rates of 60–70% after allogeneic HSCT. As treatment becomes more sophisticated, outcome is increasingly related to the subtype of AML. Currently, AML in patients with t(8;21), t(15;17), inv 16, or Down syndrome has the most favorable prognosis, with 65–75% long-term survival using modern treatments, including chemotherapy alone. The least favorable outcome occurs in AML patients with monosomy 7 or 5, 7q, 5q–, or 11q23 cytogenetic abnormalities.

880,Myeloproliferative Diseases,Orthopedics ,4890,"MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASES ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Leukocytosis with predominance of immature cells.  Often indolent course.  Fever, bone pain, respiratory symptoms.  Hepatosplenomegaly. Myeloproliferative diseases in children are relatively rare. They are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that results in excessive peripheral blood counts. The three most important types are chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which accounts for less than 5% of the childhood leuke- mias, transient myeloproliferative disorder in children with Down syndrome, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (Table 29–2).   CHAPTER 29 860 3. Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), accounts for approximately one third of the myelodysplastic and myelo- proliferative disorders in childhood. Patients with neurofi- bromatosis type 1 (NF-1) are at higher risk of JMML than the general population. It typically occurs in infants and very young children and is occasionally associated with mono- somy 7 or a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7. Patients with JMML present similarly to those with other hematopoietic malignancies, with lymphadenopathy, hepato- splenomegaly, skin rash, or respiratory symptoms. Patients may have stigmata of NF-1 with neurofibromas or café-au-lait spots. Laboratory findings include anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with monocytosis, and elevated fetal hemoglobin. The results of chemotherapy for children with JMML have been disappointing, with estimated survival rates of less than 30%. Approximately 40–45% of patients are projected to sur- vive long term using HSCT, although optimizing conditioning regimens and donor selection may improve these results.

882,Brain Tumors,Orthopedics ,2494,"BRAIN TUMORS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Classic triad: morning headache, vomiting, and papille- dema.  Increasing head circumference, cranial nerve palsies, dysarthria, ataxia, hemiplegia, papilledema, hyperre- flexia, macrocephaly, cracked pot sign.  Seizures, personality change, blurred vision, diplopia, weakness, decreased coordination, precocious puberty.  General Considerations The classic triad of morning headache, vomiting, and papilledema is present in fewer than 30% of children at presentation. School failure and personality changes are common in older children. Irritability, failure to thrive, and delayed development are common in very young children with brain tumors. Recent-onset head tilt can result from a posterior fossa tumor. Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, accounting for 1500–2000 new malignancies in children each year in the United States and for 25–30% of all childhood cancers. In general, children with brain tumors have a better prognosis than do adults. Favorable outcome occurs most commonly with low-grade and fully resectable tumors. Unfortunately, cranial irradiation in young children can have significant neuropsychological, intellectual, and endocrinologic sequelae. Brain tumors in childhood are biologically and histologi- cally heterogeneous, ranging from low-grade localized lesions to high-grade tumors with neuraxis dissemination. High-dose systemic chemotherapy is used frequently, espe- cially in young children with high-grade tumors, in an effort to delay, decrease, or completely avoid cranial irradiation. Such intensive treatment may be accompanied by autolo- gous HSCT or peripheral stem cell reconstitution. The causes of pediatric brain tumors are unknown. The risk of developing astrocytomas is increased in children with neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis. Several studies show that some childhood brain tumors occur in families with increased genetic susceptibility to childhood cancers in general, brain tumors, or leukemia and lymphoma. A higher incidence of seizures has been observed in relatives of chil- dren with astrocytoma. Certain pediatric brain tumors such as ependymoma have been linked to polyomavirus, but the exact relationship is unknown. The risk of developing a brain tumor is increased in children who received cranial irradia- tion for treatment of meningeal leukemia. Because pediatric brain tumors are rare, they are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late; most pediatricians see no more than two children with brain tumors during their careers.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Clinical findings at presentation vary depending on the child’s age and the tumor’s location. Children younger than age 2 years more commonly have infratentorial tumors. Children with such tumors usually present with nonspecific symptoms such as vomiting, unsteadiness, lethargy, and irritability. Signs may be surprisingly few or may include macrocephaly, ataxia,   NEOPLASTIC DISEASE 863 gliomas. Traditional treatment of these tumors has been local irradiation. Hyperfractionation to increase the dose from the conventional 54 Gy to 72–78 Gy showed no apparent benefit in a recent Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) study. New approaches are needed for this prognostically poor tumor. The treatment of low-grade astrocytomas is evolving. Increasing numbers of young children are receiving antitu- mor chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin and vin- cristine after incomplete resection of these tumors. The role of irradiation after subtotal resection even in older children is being questioned.  Prognosis Despite improvements in surgery and radiation therapy, the outlook for cure remains poor for children with high-grade glial tumors. For children with high-grade gliomas, an early CCG study showed a 45% progression-free survival rate for children who received radiation therapy and chemotherapy. A follow-up CCG study in which all patients had chemother- apy and radiation therapy showed a 5-year progression-free survival rate of 36%. There is a possibility of effective salvage therapy with high-dose chemotherapy for children who relapse. In addition, the extent of resection appeared to correlate positively with prognosis, with a 3-year progres- sion-free survival rate of 17% for patients receiving biopsy only, 29–32% for patients receiving partial or subtotal resec- tions, and 54% for those receiving 90% resections. Biologic factors that may affect survival are being increasingly recog- nized. The prognosis for diffuse pontine gliomas remains very poor, with no benefit from high-dose chemotherapy plus radiation therapy versus radiation alone. The 5- and even 10-year survival rate for low-grade astro- cytomas of childhood is 60–90%. However, prognosis depends on both site and grade. A child with a pilocytic astrocytoma of the cerebellum has a considerably better prog- nosis than a child with a fibrillary astrocytoma of the cerebral cortex. Recently, a new entity of low-grade tumor of child- hood, the pilomyxoid astrocytoma has been recognized. Pilo- myxoid astrocytomas seem to have a worse prognosis than juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas. For recurrent or progressive low-grade astrocytoma of childhood, relatively moderate che- motherapy may improve the likelihood of survival. Conventional craniospinal irradiation for children with low-stage medulloblastoma results in survival rates of 60– 90%. Ten-year survival rates are lower (40–60%). Chemo- therapy allows a reduction in the craniospinal radiation dose while preserving survival rates for average-risk patients (86% survival at 5 years on the most recent COG average-risk protocol). However, even reduced-dose craniospinal irradia- tion has an adverse effect on intellect, especially in children younger than age 7 years. Five-year survival rates for high- risk medulloblastoma have been 25–40%, but a recent trial reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference in 2007 suggests a dramatically improved prognosis for patients receiving intensive chemotherapy and irradiation. Children with supratentorial primitive neuroec- todermal tumors also benefit from the addition of chemo- therapy to craniospinal irradiation. Major challenges remain in treating brain tumors in children younger than age 3 years and in treating brainstem gliomas and malignant gliomas. The increasing emphasis is on the quality of life of survivors, not just the survival rate.

885,Lymphomas & Lymphoproliferative Disorders,Orthopedics ,4633,"LYMPHOMAS &  LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS The term lymphoma refers to a malignant proliferation of lymphoid cells, usually in association with and arising from lymphoid tissues (ie, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen). In contrast, the term leukemia refers to a malignancy arising from the bone marrow, which may include lymphoid cells. Because lymphomas can involve the bone marrow, the distinction between the two can be confusing. The diagnosis of lymphoma is a common one among childhood cancers, accounting for 10–15% of all malignancies. The most com- mon form is Hodgkin disease, which represents nearly half of all cases. The remaining subtypes, referred to collectively as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, are divided into four main groups: lymphoblastic, small noncleaved cell, large B-cell, and ana- plastic large cell lymphomas. In contrast to lymphomas, lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are quite rare in the general population. Most are polyclonal, nonmalignant (though often life-threatening) accumulations of lymphocytes that occur when the immune system fails to control virally transformed lymphocytes. However, a malignant monoclonal proliferation can also arise. The post-transplant LPDs arise in patients who are immunosuppressed to prevent solid organ or bone marrow transplant rejection, particularly liver and heart transplant patients. Spontaneous LPDs occur in immunodeficient indi- viduals and, less commonly, in immunocompetent persons.   CHAPTER 29 868 lymphomas represent the development of malignant clones, sometimes arising from recognized LPDs. A. Post-Transplantation  Lymphoproliferative Disorders Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) arise in patients who have received substantial immuno- suppressive medications for solid organ or bone marrow transplantation. In these patients, reactivation of latent EBV infection in B cells drives a polyclonal proliferation of these cells that is fatal if not halted. Occasionally a true lymphoma develops, often bearing a chromosomal translocation. LPDs are an increasingly common and significant com- plication of transplantation. The incidence of PTLD ranges from approximately 2% to 15% of transplant recipients, depending on the organ transplanted and the immunosup- pressive regimen. Treatment of these disorders is a challenge for transplant physicians and oncologists. The initial treatment is reduction in immunosuppression, which allows the patient’s own immune cells to destroy the virally transformed lympho- cytes. However, this is only effective in approximately half of the patients. For those patients who do not respond to reduced immune suppression, chemotherapy of various reg- imens may succeed. The use of anti-B-cell antibodies, such as rituximab (anti-CD20), for the treatment of PTLDs has been promising in clinical trials. B. Spontaneous Lymphoproliferative Disease Immunodeficiencies in which LPDs occur include Bloom syndrome, Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, congenital T-cell immunodeficiencies, and HIV infection. Treatment depends on the circumstances, but unlike PTLD, few therapeutic options are often available. Castleman disease is an LPD occurring in pediatric patients without any apparent immunodeficiency. The autoim- mune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is character- ized by widespread lymphadenopathy with hepatospleno- megaly, and autoimmune phenomena. ALPS results from mutations in the Fas ligand pathway that is critical in regulation of apoptosis.

It is composed of small, fairly uniform cells with little cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei that may form rosette patterns. Pathologic diagnosis is not always easy, and neuroblastoma must be differentiated from the other “small, round, blue cell” malignancies of childhood (Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, and lymphoma). Neuroblastoma accounts for 7–10% of pediatric malig- nancies and is the most common solid neoplasm outside the CNS. Fifty percent of neuroblastomas are diagnosed before age 2 years and 90% before age 5 years. Neuroblastoma is a biologically diverse disease with var- ied clinical behavior ranging from spontaneous regression to progression through very aggressive therapy. Unfortunately, despite significant advances in our understanding of this tumor at the cellular and molecular level, the overall survival rate in advanced disease has changed little in 20 years, with 3-year event-free survival being less than 15%.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Clinical manifestations vary with the primary site of malig- nant disease and the neuroendocrine function of the tumor. Many children present with constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and irritability. Bone pain suggests meta- static disease, which is present in 60% of children older than 1 year of age at diagnosis. Physical examination may reveal a firm, fixed, irregularly shaped mass that extends beyond the midline. The margins are often poorly defined. Although most children have an abdominal primary tumor (40% adrenal gland, 25% paraspinal ganglion), neuroblastoma can arise wherever there is sympathetic tissue. In the posterior mediastinum, the tumor is usually asymptomatic and dis- covered on a chest radiograph obtained for other reasons. Patients with cervical neuroblastoma present with a neck mass, which is often misdiagnosed as infection. Horner syndrome (unilateral ptosis, myosis, and anhydrosis) or heterochromia iridis (differently colored irises) may accom- pany cervical neuroblastoma. Paraspinous tumors can   CHAPTER 29 870 complete or partial remission, although in advanced disease, remission is seldom durable. For low-risk disease (stage 1 and 2, with good biologic features), surgical resection alone may be sufficient to affect a cure. Infants younger than 1 year with stage 4S disease may need little if any therapy, although chemotherapy may be initiated because of bulky disease causing mechanical compli- cations. In intermediate-risk neuroblastoma (subsets of patients with stage 3 and 4 disease) the primary treatment approach is surgical combined with chemotherapy. High-risk patients (the majority with stage 3 and 4 disease) require multimodal therapy, including surgery, irradiation, chemo- therapy, and autologous HSCT. The administration of cis- retinoic acid, a differentiating agent, can prolong disease-free survival in advanced-stage neuroblastoma when administered in the setting of minimal residual disease (MRD) after HSCT. Cooperative clinical trials are underway in high-risk patients using ch14.18 (a monoclonal antibody specific for the predominant antigen on neuroblastoma cells) and cyto- kines to eradicate MRD. A phase II study is underway using fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid, and radiolabeled MIBG is also being investigated. For children with stage 1, 2, or 4S disease, the 5-year survival rate is 70–90%. Infants younger than 460 days old have a greater than 80% likelihood of long-term survival. Children older than age 1 year with stage 3 disease have an intermediate prognosis (approximately 40–70%). Older patients with stage 4 disease have a poor prognosis (5–50% survival 5 years from diagnosis), although patients 12–18 months old with hyperdiploidy and nonamplified MYCN have an excellent prognosis.

892,Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma),Sports Medicine ,2660,"WILMS TUMOR (NEPHROBLASTOMA) ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Asymptomatic abdominal mass or swelling (83%).  Fever (23%), hematuria (21%).  Hypertension (25%), genitourinary malformations (6%), aniridia, hemihypertrophy.  General Considerations Approximately 460 new cases of Wilms tumor occur annu- ally in the United States, representing 5–6% of cancers in children younger than age 15 years. After neuroblastoma, this is the second most common abdominal tumor in chil- dren. The majority of Wilms tumors are of sporadic occur- rence. However, in a few children, Wilms tumor occurs in the setting of associated malformations or syndromes, including aniridia, hemihypertrophy, genitourinary malfor- mations (eg, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, gonadal dysgene- sis, pseudohermaphroditism, and horseshoe kidney), Beck- with-Wiedemann syndrome, Denys-Drash syndrome, and WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, ambiguous geni- talia, mental retardation). The median age at diagnosis is related both to gender and laterality, with bilateral tumors presenting at a younger age than unilateral tumors, and males being diagnosed earlier than females. Wilms tumor occurs most commonly between ages 2 and 5 years; it is unusual after age 6 years. The mean age at diagnosis is 4 years.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Most children with Wilms tumor present with increasing size of the abdomen or an asymptomatic abdominal mass incidentally discovered by a parent. The mass is usually smooth and firm, well demarcated, and rarely crosses the midline, though it can extend inferiorly into the pelvis. About 25% of patients are hypertensive at presentation. Gross hematuria is an uncommon presentation, although microscopic hematuria occurs in approximately 25% of patients. B. Laboratory Findings The CBC is usually normal, but some patients have anemia secondary to hemorrhage into the tumor. Blood urea nitro- gen and serum creatinine are usually normal. Urinalysis may show some blood or leukocytes. C. Imaging and Staging Ultrasonography or CT of the abdomen should establish the presence of an intrarenal mass. It is also essential to evaluate the contralateral kidney for presence and function as well as synchronous Wilms tumor. The inferior vena cava needs to be evaluated by ultrasonography for the presence and extent of tumor propagation. The liver should be imaged for the presence of metastatic disease. A plain chest radiograph (four views) or chest CT scans (or both) should be obtained to determine whether pulmonary metastases are present.   NEOPLASTIC DISEASE 871 Approximately 10% of patients will have metastatic disease at diagnosis. Of these, 80% will have pulmonary disease and 15% liver metastases. Bone and brain metastases are extremely uncommon and usually associated with different, more aggressive renal tumors, such as clear cell sarcoma or rhabdoid tumor; hence, bone scans and brain imaging are not routinely performed. The clinical stage is ultimately decided at surgery and confirmed by the pathologist.  Treatment & Prognosis In the United States, treatment of Wilms tumor begins with surgical exploration of the abdomen via an anterior surgical approach to allow for inspection and palpation of the con- tralateral kidney. The liver and lymph nodes are inspected and suspicious areas biopsied or excised. En bloc resection of tumor is performed. Every attempt is made to avoid tumor spillage at surgery as this may change staging and treatment. Because therapy is tailored to tumor stage, it is imperative that a surgeon familiar with the staging requirements per- form the operation. In addition to the staging, the histologic type has implica- tions for therapy and prognosis. Favorable histology (FH; see later discussion) refers to the classic triphasic Wilms tumor and its variants. Unfavorable histology (UH) refers to the presence of diffuse anaplasia (extreme nuclear atypia) and is present in 5% of Wilms tumors. Only a few small foci of anaplasia in a Wilms tumor give a worse prognosis to patients with stage II, III, or IV tumors. Loss of heterozygos- ity of chromosomes 1p and 16q are adverse prognostic factors in those with favorable histology. Following excision and pathologic examination, the patient is assigned a stage that defines further therapy. Improvement in the treatment of Wilms tumor has resulted in an overall cure rate of approximately 90%. The National Wilms Tumor Study Group’s fourth study (NWTS- 4) demonstrated that survival rates were improved by inten- sifying therapy during the initial treatment phase while shortening overall treatment duration (24 weeks vs 60 weeks of treatment). Table 29–8 provides an overview of the current treatment recommendations in NWTS-5. Patients with stage III or IV Wilms tumor require radiation therapy to the tumor bed and to sites of metastatic disease. Chemotherapy is optimally begun within 5 days after surgery, whereas radiation therapy should be started within 10 days. Stage V (bilateral Wilms tumor) disease dictates a different approach, consisting of possible bilateral renal biopsies followed by chemotherapy and second-look renal-sparing surgery. Radiation therapy may also be necessary. Using these approaches, 4-year overall survival rates through NWTS-4 are as follows: stage I FH, 96%; stage II–IV FH, 82–92%; stage I–III UH (diffuse anaplasia), 56–70%; stage IV UH, 17%. Patients with recurrent Wilms tumor have a salvage rate of approximately 50% with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (singly or in combina- tion). HSCT is also being explored as a way to improve the chances of survival after relapse. Future Considerations Although progress in the treatment of Wilms tumor has been extraordinary, important questions remain to be answered. Questions have been raised regarding the role of prenephrec- tomy chemotherapy in the treatment of Wilms tumor. Presur- gical chemotherapy seems to decrease tumor rupture at resec- tion but may unfavorably affect outcome by changing staging. Future studies will be directed at minimizing acute and long- term toxicities for those with low-risk disease and improving outcomes for those with high-risk and recurrent disease.

893,Bone Tumors,Sports Medicine ,4225,"BONE TUMORS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Bone pain.  Mass lesion noted on examination. Primary malignant bone tumors are uncommon in child- hood with only 650–700 new cases per year. Osteosarcoma accounts for 60% of cases and occurs mostly in adolescents and young adults. Ewing sarcoma is the second most com- mon malignant tumor of bony origin and occurs in toddlers to young adults. Both tumors have a male predominance. Table 29–8. Treatment of Wilms tumor.

Symptoms and Signs Pain at the site of the primary tumor is the most common presenting sign, with or without swelling and erythema. No specific laboratory findings are characteristic of Ewing sar- coma, but an elevated LDH may be present and is of prognostic significance. B. Imaging and Staging The radiographic appearance of Ewing sarcoma overlaps with osteosarcoma, although Ewing sarcoma usually involves the diaphyses of long bones. The central axial skeleton gives rise to 40% of Ewing tumors. Evaluation of a patient diag- nosed as having Ewing sarcoma should include CT scan or MRI (or both) of the primary lesion to define the extent of local disease as precisely as possible. This is imperative for planning future surgical procedures or radiation therapy. Metastatic disease is present in 25% of patients at diagnosis. The lung (38%), bone (particularly the spine) (31%), and the bone marrow (11%) are the most common sites for metastasis. CT scan of the chest, bone scanning, and bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are all essential to the staging workup. A biopsy is essential in establishing the diagnosis. Histo- logically, Ewing sarcoma consists of sheets of undifferenti- ated cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, well-defined cell bor- ders, and scanty cytoplasm. Necrosis is common. Electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and cytogenetics may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A generous tissue biopsy specimen is often necessary for diagnosis but should not delay starting chemotherapy. A consistent cytogenetic abnormality, t(11;22), has been identified in Ewing sarcoma and PNET and is present in 85– 90% of tumors. These tumors also express the protooncogene c-myc, which may be helpful in differentiating Ewing sarcoma from neuroblastoma, in which c-myc is not expressed.  Treatment & Prognosis Therapy usually commences with the administration of chemotherapy after biopsy and is followed by local control measures. Depending on many factors, including the pri- mary site of the tumor and the response to chemotherapy, local control could be achieved by surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of these methods. Following local control, chemotherapy continues for approximately 1 year. Effective treatment for Ewing sarcoma uses combinations of dactino- mycin, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etopo- side, and ifosfamide. Patients with small localized primary tumors have a 50–70% long-term, disease-free survival rate. For patients with metastatic disease and large pelvic primary tumors, survival is poor. Autologous HSCT is being investi- gated for the treatment of these high-risk patients. Bernstein M et al: Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors: Current management.

895,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Sports Medicine ,3812,"RHABDOMYOSARCOMA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Painless, progressively enlarging mass; proptosis; chronic drainage (nasal, aural, sinus, vaginal); cranial nerve palsies.  Urinary obstruction, constipation, hematuria.  General Considerations Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sar- coma occurring in childhood and accounts for 10% of solid tumors in childhood. The peak incidence is at ages 2–5 years; 70% of children are diagnosed before age 10 years. A second smaller peak is seen in adolescents with extremity tumors. Males are affected more commonly than females. Rhabdomyosarcoma can occur anywhere in the body. When rhabdomyosarcoma imitates striated muscle and cross-striations are seen by light microscopy, the diagnosis is straightforward. Immunohistochemistry, electron micros- copy, or chromosomal analysis is sometimes necessary to make the diagnosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma is further classified into subtypes based on pathologic features: embryonal (60– 80%), of which botryoid is a variant; alveolar (about 15– 20%); undifferentiated sarcoma (8%); pleomorphic, which is seen in adults (1%); and other (11%). These subtypes occur in characteristic locations and have different meta- static potentials and outcomes. Although the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma is unknown, in rare cases a genetic predisposition has been determined.

897,Retinoblastoma,Sports Medicine ,679,"RETINOBLASTOMA  General Considerations Retinoblastoma is a neuroectodermal malignancy arising from embryonic retinal cells that accounts for 3% of malig- nant disease in children younger than age 15 years. It is the most common intraocular tumor in pediatric patients and causes 5% of cases of childhood blindness. In the United States, 200–300 new cases occur per year. This is a malignancy of early childhood, with 90% of the tumors diagnosed before age 5 years. Bilateral involvement occurs in 20–30% of chil- dren and typically is diagnosed at a younger age (median age 14 months) than unilateral disease (median age 23 months). Retinoblastoma is the prototype of hereditary cancers due to a mutation in the retinoblastoma gene (RB1), which is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q14). This gene is a tumor-suppressor gene that normally controls cellular growth. When the gene is inactivated, as in retinoblastoma, cellular growth is uncontrolled. Uncontrolled cell growth leads to tumor formation. Inactivation of both RB1 alleles within the same cell is required for tumor formation. Retinoblastoma is known to arise in heritable and nonherita- ble forms. Based on the different clinical characteristics of the two forms, Knudson proposed a “two-hit” hypothesis for retino- blastoma tumor development. He postulated that two indepen- dent events were necessary for a cell to acquire tumor potential. Mutations at the RB1 locus can be inherited or arise spontane- ously. In heritable cases, the first mutation arises during gameto- genesis, either spontaneously (90%) or through transmission from a parent (10%). This mutation is present in every retinal cell and in all other somatic and germ cells. Ninety percent of persons who carry this germline mutation will develop retino- blastoma. For tumor formation, the loss of the second RB1 allele within a cell must occur; loss of only one allele is insufficient for tumor formation. The second mutation occurs in a somatic (retinal) cell. In nonheritable cases (60%), both mutations arise in a somatic cell after gametogenesis has taken place.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Children with retinoblastoma generally come to medical attention while the tumor is still confined to the globe. Although present at birth, retinoblastoma is not usually detected until it has grown to a considerable size. Leukoco- ria (white pupillary reflex) is the most common sign (found in 60% of patients). Parents may note an unusual appear- ance of the eye or asymmetry of the eyes in a photograph. The differential diagnosis of leukocoria includes Toxocara canis granuloma, astrocytic hamartoma, retinopathy of pre- maturity, Coats disease, and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. Strabismus (in 20% of patients) is seen when the tumor involves the macula and central vision is lost. Rarely (in 7% of patients), a painful red eye with glaucoma, a hyphema, or proptosis is the initial manifestation. A single focus or multiple foci of tumor may be seen in one or both eyes at diagnosis. Bilateral involvement occurs in 20–30% of children. B. Diagnostic Evaluation Suspected retinoblastoma requires a detailed ophthalmo- logic examination under general anesthesia. An ophthalmol- ogist makes the diagnosis of retinoblastoma by the appear- ance of the tumor within the eye without pathologic confirmation. A white to creamy pink mass protruding into the vitreous matter suggests the diagnosis; intraocular calci- fications and vitreous seeding are virtually pathognomonic of retinoblastoma. A CT scan of the orbits detects intraocular calcification, evaluates the optic nerve for tumor infiltration, and detects extraocular extension of tumor. A single focus or multiple foci of tumor may be seen in one or both eyes at diagnosis. Metastatic disease of the marrow and meninges can be ruled out with bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies plus CSF cytology.  Treatment Each eye is treated according to the potential for useful vision, and every attempt is made to preserve vision. The choice of therapy depends on the size, location, and number of intraocular lesions. Absolute indications for enucleation include no vision, neovascular glaucoma, inability to exam- ine the treated eye, and inability to control tumor growth with conservative treatment. External beam irradiation has been the mainstay of therapy. A total dose of 35–45 Gy is administered. However, many centers are investigating the role of systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of retino- blastoma confined to the globe and the elimination of external beam radiotherapy is now accepted. Cryotherapy, photocoagulation, and radioactive plaques can be used for local tumor control. Patients with metastatic disease receive chemotherapy. Children with retinoblastoma confined to the retina (whether unilateral or bilateral) have an excellent prognosis, with 5-year survival rates greater than 90%. Mortality is correlated directly with extent of optic nerve involvement, orbital extension of tumor, and massive choroid invasion. Patients who have disease in the optic nerve beyond the   CHAPTER 29 876 lamina cribrosa have a 5-year survival rate of only 40%. Patients with meningeal or metastatic spread rarely survive, although intensive chemotherapy and autologous HSCT have produced long-term survivors. Patients with the germline mutation (heritable form) have a significant risk of developing second primary tumors. Osteosarcomas account for 40% of such tumors. Second malignant neoplasms occur in both patients who have and those who have not received radiation therapy. The 30-year cumulative incidence for a second neoplasm is 35% in patients who received radiation therapy and 6% in those who did not receive radiation therapy. The risk continues to increase over time. Although radiation contributes to the risk, it is the presence of the retinoblastoma gene itself that is responsible for the development of nonocular tumors in these patients.

898,Hepatic Tumors,Sports Medicine ,1744,"HEPATIC TUMORS (SEE ALSO CHAPTER 21) Two thirds of liver masses found in childhood are malignant. Ninety percent of hepatic malignancies are either hepato- blastoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatoblastoma accounts for the vast majority of liver tumors in children younger than age 5 years, hepatocellular carcinoma for the majority in children aged 15–19 years. The features of these hepatic malignancies are compared in Table 29–10. Of the benign tumors, 60% are hamartomas or vascular tumors such as hemangiomas. There is mounting evidence for a strong association between prematurity and the risk of hepatoblastoma. Children with hepatic tumors usually come to medical attention because of an enlarging abdomen. Approximately 10% of hepatoblastomas are first discovered on routine examination. Anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, and abdomi- nal pain are associated more commonly with hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum α-fetoprotein is often elevated and is an excellent marker for response to treatment. Imaging studies should include abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Malignant tumors have a diffuse hyper- echoic pattern on ultrasonography, whereas benign tumors are usually poorly echoic. Vascular lesions contain areas with varying degrees of echogenicity. Ultrasound is also useful for imaging the hepatic veins, portal veins, and inferior vena cava. CT scanning and, in particular, MRI are important for defining the extent of tumor within the liver. CT scanning of the chest and bone scan should be obtained to evaluate for metastatic spread. Because bone marrow involvement is extremely rare, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are not indicated. The prognosis for children with hepatic malignancies depends on the tumor type and the resectability of the Table 29–10. Comparison of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in childhood.

Complete resectability is essential for survival. Che- motherapy can decrease the size of most hepatoblasto- mas. Following biopsy of the lesion, neoadjuvant chemo- therapy is administered prior to attempting complete surgical resection. Chemotherapy can often convert an inoperable tumor to a completely resectable one and can also eradicate metastatic disease. Approximately 50–60% of hepatoblasto- mas are fully resectable, whereas only one third of hepatocel- lular carcinomas can be completely removed. Even with complete resection, only one third of patients with hepato- cellular carcinoma are long-term survivors. A recent CCG/ Pediatric Oncology Group trial has shown cisplatin, fluoro- uracil, and vincristine to be as effective as but less toxic than cisplatin and doxorubicin in treating hepatoblastoma. Other drug combinations that have demonstrated benefit include carboplatin plus etoposide and doxorubicin plus ifosfamide. Radiation as well as liver transplantation is being investi- gated for patients whose tumors cannot be completely resected following chemotherapy.

899,Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis,Sports Medicine ,1919,"LANGERHANS CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Seborrheic skin rashes.  Diaper rash.  Draining ears.  Bone pain.  General Considerations Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH; formerly called histiocy- tosis X) is a rare and poorly understood spectrum of disor- ders. It can occur as an isolated lesion or as widespread systemic disease involving virtually any body site. Eosino- philic granuloma, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease, and Let- terer-Siwe disease are all syndromes encompassed by this disorder. LCH is not a true malignancy, but instead is a clonal, reactive proliferation of normal histiocytic cells, per- haps resulting from an immunoregulatory defect. The distinctive pathologic feature is proliferation of his- tiocytic cells beyond what would be seen in a normal inflam- matory process. Langerhans histiocytes have typical features: on light microscopy, the nuclei are deeply indented (coffee bean–shaped) and elongated, and the cytoplasm is pale, distinct, and abundant. Additional diagnostic characteristics include Birbeck granules on electron microscopy, expression of CD1 on the cell surface, and positive immunostaining for S-100 protein.  Clinical Findings Because LCH encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases, its presentation can be variable, from a single asymptomatic lesion to widely disseminated disease. Patients with localized disease present primarily with lesions limited to bone. Occasionally found incidentally on radiographs obtained for other reasons, these lesions are well-demarcated and frequently found in the skull, clavicles, ribs, and vertebrae. These lesions can be painful. Patients can also present with localized disease of the skin, often as a diaper rash that does not resolve. Bony lesions, fever, weight loss, otitis media, exophthal- mos, and diabetes insipidus occur in a small number of children with the disease. Children with this multifocal disease, formerly called Hand-Schüller-Christian disease, commonly present with generalized symptoms and organ dysfunction. Children with disseminated LCH (formerly called Let- terer-Siwe disease) typically present before age 2 years with a seborrheic skin rash, fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and hematologic abnormalities. Diagnosis is made with biopsy of the involved organ. The workup should include a CBC, liver and kidney function tests, a skeletal survey or technetium bone scan, and a urinalysis with specific gravity to rule out diabetes insipidus.  Treatment & Prognosis The outcome in LCH is extremely variable, but the process usually resolves spontaneously. Isolated lesions may need no therapy at all. Intralesional corticosteroids, curettage, and low-dose radiation therapy are useful local treatment mea- sures for symptomatic focal lesions. Patients with localized disease have an excellent prognosis. Multifocal disease is often treated with systemic chemo- therapy. Prednisone with vinblastine or etoposide can be given repeatedly or continuously until lesions heal; the drugs can then be reduced and finally stopped. HSCT can also be used with success in refractory cases. Multifocal disease is less predictable, but most cases resolve without sequelae. Age, degree of organ involvement, and response to therapy are the most important prognostic   CHAPTER 29 878 factors. Infants with disseminated disease tend to do poorly, with mortality rates approaching 50%. New treatment approaches for patients who do not respond to conventional chemotherapy have been evaluated in small studies. 2- Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) has been used with some success. Therapeutic strategies targeting the dysregulated immune response using interferon-α or etanercept (anti– tumor necrosis factor-α) have also been reported.

900,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,Sports Medicine ,1434,"HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL  TRANSPLANTATION Amy K. Keating, MD, Roger H. Giller, MD,  & Ralph R. Quinones, MD INDICATIONS & RATIONALE Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), often referred to as bone marrow transplantation, involves the intravenous infusion of stem cells to reestablish normal hematopoiesis following marrow ablative or subablative che- motherapy, or radiation therapy (or both). HSCT is consid- ered standard therapy for a variety of malignancies, hemato- poietic disorders (aplastic anemia, hemoglobinopathies), storage diseases, and severe immunodeficiencies. It is con- sidered first-line therapy in illnesses such as JMML and severe combined immunodeficiency, as no other curative therapy exists, but most often it is recommended only in high-risk situations or when conventional treatment fails. For example, HSCT is used in sickle cell disease for patients with significant complications and in leukemia patients who have very high-risk cytogenetic features. The rationale for HSCT in patients with nonmalignant disorders is that the transplanted stem cells replace the absent or defective hematopoietic or lymphoid elements. In patients with storage disorders, such as Hurler disease, HSCT provides enzyme-making donor macrophages that populate host tissues. In children with oncologic disorders, HSCT is multidi- mensional. Because marrow function is rescued with hema- topoietic stem cells, higher doses of chemotherapy or radia- tion (or both) can be administered, which may overcome cancer cell resistance and achieve optimal tumor cell kill. Additionally, in patients who receive an allogeneic HSCT (stem cells from another person), the donor lymphoid cells may recognize the cancer as foreign and provide an immu- nologic attack on the malignancy, a concept known as the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect. PREPARATION FOR HSCT The selection of the stem cell source for transplantation is an important first step. There are a variety of stem cell sources to consider, and their utility is dependent on the disease process. HSCT sources can be divided into two main categories: autologous (ie, infusion of the patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells) and allogeneic (ie, infusion of another individual’s hematopoietic stem cells). Stem cells can be obtained from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. Autologous transplantation, often referred to as “stem cell rescue” is restricted to the treatment of selected pediatric malignancies, such as neuroblastoma, lymphoma, certain brain tumors, and Ewing sarcoma. Autologous transplanta- tion offers the ability to deliver large doses of chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic rescue using an infusion of the patients own stem cells. Relapse of the original disease continues to be the greatest obstacle to successful autologous transplantation, likely due to limitations in achieving sys- temic cancer control prior to transplant, collecting sufficient progenitor cells that are not contaminated by tumor cells, and lack of GVT effect. The selection of a suitable donor for allogeneic transplan- tation is critical and remains a major challenge. The princi- ple genes known to encode for allogeneic recognition reside within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) located on chromosome 6. The MHC class I antigens, HLA-A, HLA- B, and HLA-C, and the class II antigens, HLA-DR and HLA- DQ, can mediate graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Each child expresses one set of paternal and one set of maternal HLA antigens. Thus, the probability of one child inheriting any specific combination and matching another sibling for an allogeneic transplant is 1 in 4. Large worldwide registries for bone marrow and umbilical cord blood donors have been developed; however, finding a closely matched unrelated donor can still be difficult, espe- cially in underrepresented minority populations. TRANSPLANT FUNDAMENTALS Transplantation has four major treatment phases: preparative therapy, lymphohematopoietic rescue, supportive care, and long-term follow-up. The preparative phase is designed to be both myeloablative and antineoplastic. In the allogeneic trans- plant recipient, the preparative treatment also provides the    883 30 "

PAIN MANAGEMENT PAIN ASSESSMENT Pain Scales Standardizing pain measurements requires the use of appro- priate pain scales. At most institutions, pain scales are stratified by age (Table 30–1) and are used throughout the institution from operating room to medical floor to clinic, creating a common language around a patient’s pain. Pain assessment using such scales has become the “fifth vital sign” in hospital settings and is documented at least as frequently as heart rate and blood pressure at many pediatric centers around the world. Many pain scales are available (see Figures 30–1 and 30–2, and Table 30–2, for examples). The type of scale used is less important than its use on a consistent basis. Special Populations Noncommunicative patients such as neonates and the cogni- tively impaired are often difficult to assess for pain. In these patient populations, use of an appropriate assessment tool (see Table 30–1) on a frequent basis is essential to assure adequate pain control. An increasing pain score trend is often a sign of discomfort. ACUTE PAIN  General Considerations Acute pain is caused by an identifiable source. In most cases it is self-limiting, and treatment is a reflection of severity and type of injury. In children the majority of acute pain is cased by trauma or, if in a hospital setting, an iatrogenic source such as surgery.  Treatment Treatment of acute pain depends on the disposition of the individual patient. For outpatient care the mainstay of treat- ment is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; Table 30–3). Acetaminophen is the most commonly used NSAID. Acetaminophen is administered via oral or rectal routes but is more predictable in its effects as an oral dose. Round-the-clock administration has been proved to be more effective than as-needed (PRN) dosing for minor pain or as an adjunct for major pain. The toxicity of acetaminophen is low in clinically used doses; however, liver damage or failure can occur with doses exceeding 200 mg/kg/d. Other oral analgesics available in suspension are ibuprofen and naproxen (see Table 30–3 for dosing). When pain is more severe oral opioids can be added for short-term use (Table 30–4). Many of these drugs are formu- lated with an NSAID, for example, oxycodone plus acetamin- ophen (Percocet) and hydrocodone plus acetaminophen (Lortab). When using combination drugs, the dose of drug is based on the opioid component. Other concomitantly administered similar NSAIDs should be discontinued.

Between 1% and 10% of people (Asians, 1–2%; African Americans, 1–3%; Caucasians, 5–10%) have a genetic polymorphism that makes them poor metabolizers of codeine. These patients obtain no effect from this drug. A very small percentage of patients (primarily from East Africa) are ultrarapid metabolizers. These patients convert 10–15 times the amount of parent drug to the active compound, which can result in clinical toxicity. Morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone are all available as suspensions, are active as administered, and are metabolized by multiple routes. For severe pain not amenable to oral analgesics, an intravenous opioid can be titrated to effect; options for pain relief are dependent on the severity and location of pain, and the patient’s age. Often the NSAID ketorolac (0.5–1.0 mg/ kg) is used as an adjunct for severe pain. Side effects of ketorolac are the same as for adults: renal insufficiency, gastric irritability and prolonged bleeding times due to decreased platelet adhesiveness. Patients with bleeding con- cerns should not receive ketorolac. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps can be used in children as young as age 6 years with proper instruction and coaching (Table 30–5). Morphine and hydromorphone are the most commonly used drugs for PCA management in the United States. Whenever PCA is used it is imperative to assess patients frequently (at least hourly) to assure adequate pain relief.

906,Chronic Pain,Sports Medicine ,1667,"CHRONIC PAIN  General Considerations Chronic pain is pain that persists past the usual course of an acute illness or beyond the time that is expected for an acute injury. In children this is an increasingly recognized problem; it is estimated that chronic pain may affect up to 10–15% of children in the United States. Among the conditions com- monly producing chronic pain in children are headache, abdominal pain, myofascial pain, fibromyalgia, juvenile rheu- matoid arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, and pain associated with cancer. Multiple contrib- uting factors, including psychosocial issues and family dynamics, often contribute to chronic pain in children.

Addiction—A primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, the development and manifestations of which are influenced by genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors. Addic- tion is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following (the 3 Cs): • Loss of Control over use of drug • Craving and compulsive use of drug • Use despite adverse Consequences Addiction is rare when opioids are used appropriately for acute pain in inpatient and outpatient settings. It should be emphasized that tolerance and dependence are not synony- mous with addiction.

B. Withdrawal 1. Recognition—Withdrawl symptoms can be expected to occur for all patients after 1 week of opioid treatment. Signs of withdrawal in older children include agitation, irritability, dysphoria, tachycardia, tachypnea, nasal congestion, tem- perature instability, and feeding intolerance. In neonates with withdrawal (neonatal abstinence syndrome), common symptoms include neurologic excitability, gastrointestinal dysfunction, autonomic signs (increased sweating, nasal stuffiness, fever, mottling, poor weight gain), and skin exco- riation caused by excessive rubbing. 2. Treatment protocol—To minimize withdrawal symp- toms in patients being weaned from opioid medications, clinicians should devise a schedule for dose reduction in conjunction with the patient and family. The duration of opioid therapy must be taken into consideration. Standard protocols involve switching to an opioid that can be adminis- tered once a day (eg, methadone) and decreasing the dose by 10–25% every 1–2 days. The patient should be monitored for signs of withdrawal over this period. If symptoms develop, consider lorazepam, 0.05–0.1 mg/kg every 6–8 hours or a clonidine patch, 0.1 mg/d (changed every fifth day).

908,Pediatric Palliative & End-of-Life Care,Sports Medicine ,2154,"PEDIATRIC PALLIATIVE & END-OF-LIFE CARE It has been estimated that almost 55,000 children die each year in the United States. At least half of these children die during the newborn period or within the first year of life. Many of these children, particularly those older than 1 year of age, suffer from illnesses that are clearly life-limiting. Thousands more are diagnosed with life-limiting illnesses resulting in chronic conditions that may last for many years, even decades. Children who are diagnosed with life-threat- ening illnesses that may be curable (eg, cancer) continue to live with the potential of a recurrence of their malignancy for many years. In all of these populations palliative and end-of- life care can play an important role during patients’ illnesses. Although commonly used interchangeably, palliative care and end-of-life care are not synonymous terms. Palliative care aims to prevent, relieve, reduce, or soothe the symptoms produced by potential life-limiting illnesses or their treat- ments and to maintain the patient’s quality of life along the entire continuum of treatment. Provision of palliative care does not imply imminent death nor does it prohibit aggressive curative treatment modalities. Rather, it acknowledges the uncertainty and potential for suffering inherent in a poten- tially life-limiting condition such as cancer. Understanding how a family defines quality of life and suffering for their child is imperative and provides a framework for decision making between care providers and the family throughout treatment. While a child is responding well to treatment, the pri- mary focus is on achieving cure of the disease. Palliative care Table 30–3. Suggested doses of nonopioid analgesics in children.

910,Pain Management in Palliative Care,Sports Medicine ,17,"PAIN MANAGEMENT IN PALLIATIVE CARE Optimal pain management is critical when providing pediat- ric palliative care. (See the section on Pain Management, earlier, for definitions and guidelines for treatment.) Chil- dren who are opioid-naïve will usually respond very well to conventional dosing of narcotics. Children who have been receiving a long-term narcotic such as codeine for pain management may need a dosage at the higher end of the spectrum when switching to an opioid such as morphine. Adjunctive medications such as NSAIDs can be extremely helpful as well and may help reduce the frequency of narcotic dose escalations. However, children at the end of life may need ongoing upward dose adjustments, which at times may exceed normal dose recommendations. When given with the intent to achieve comfort in the dying child, these escalations are ethically and morally appropriate. QUALITY-OF-LIFE ADJUNCTS  & SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT Certain nonpain symptoms and signs may develop more quickly in children at the end of life as compared with the adult population. A thorough and complete history and physical examination should be obtained. It is critical to determine how much distress the symptom causes the child and how much it interferes with the child’s and family’s routine. Areas of management should include pharmacologic intervention, nursing care, and psychosocial support. Symp- toms that commonly occur during disease progression and at the end of life in children with a life-limiting condition are listed in Table 30–6, along with suggestions for management. PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF PALLIATIVE CARE Pediatric palliative care is unique in that caregivers must be familiar with children’s normal emotional and spiritual devel- opment. Working with a child at his or her level of develop- ment through the use of both oral and expressive communica- tion allows the child to be more open with respect to hopes, dreams, and fears. A child’s understanding of death depends on his or her stage of cognitive development. Children gener- ally understand death as a changed state by age 3 years, universality by 5–6 years, and personal mortality by 8–9 years. As end of life approaches, psychosocial support is invalu- able to the child and family. Children may need someone to talk to outside of the family unit who can respond to their questions and concerns open and honestly. Parents may need guidance and support in initiating discussions with or responding to questions from their child about death and dying. Children and adolescents may have specific tasks they wish to complete before they die. Some want to have input into funeral and memorial service plans and disposition of their body. Parents often need support in making funeral arrange- ments, handling financial concerns, talking with siblings and other family members, and coping with their own grief. It is important to recognize that grief is not an illness but a normal, multidimensional, unique, and dynamic process presenting as pervasive distress due to a perceived loss. Once parents have accepted the reality of the loss of the child, they must then complete the other tasks of grief, such as experi- encing the pain of their loss and adjusting to an environment without their child, in order to move on with their lives. Parents who lose a child are at high risk for complicated grief reactions such as absent grief, delayed grief, and prolonged or unresolved grief. Siblings are also at risk for complicated grief and require special attention. SPIRITUAL & CULTURAL SUPPORT Health care decisions are often intertwined with a family’s culture and belief system. Understanding the influences of a family’s beliefs and culture allows the practitioner to provide sensitive, appropriate care, particularly at the end of life. Interaction with members of the family’s faith and cultural communities can often be instrumental in helping both the care team and the community support of the family. Allow- ance for specific prayers, rituals, or other activities may help facilitate procedures and discussions. Families who speak a foreign language are at risk for inadequate support. They may have fewer opportunities to express their concerns and fears, ask questions, and validate their understanding due to language and cultural con- straints. Every effort should be made to find and utilize a qualified interpreter, particularly for any discussion that involves delivering difficult news or making critical deci- sions.

910,Psychosocial Aspects of Palliative Care,Rehabilitation Medicine ,1592,"PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF PALLIATIVE CARE Pediatric palliative care is unique in that caregivers must be familiar with children’s normal emotional and spiritual devel- opment. Working with a child at his or her level of develop- ment through the use of both oral and expressive communica- tion allows the child to be more open with respect to hopes, dreams, and fears. A child’s understanding of death depends on his or her stage of cognitive development. Children gener- ally understand death as a changed state by age 3 years, universality by 5–6 years, and personal mortality by 8–9 years. As end of life approaches, psychosocial support is invalu- able to the child and family. Children may need someone to talk to outside of the family unit who can respond to their questions and concerns open and honestly. Parents may need guidance and support in initiating discussions with or responding to questions from their child about death and dying. Children and adolescents may have specific tasks they wish to complete before they die. Some want to have input into funeral and memorial service plans and disposition of their body. Parents often need support in making funeral arrange- ments, handling financial concerns, talking with siblings and other family members, and coping with their own grief. It is important to recognize that grief is not an illness but a normal, multidimensional, unique, and dynamic process presenting as pervasive distress due to a perceived loss. Once parents have accepted the reality of the loss of the child, they must then complete the other tasks of grief, such as experi- encing the pain of their loss and adjusting to an environment without their child, in order to move on with their lives. Parents who lose a child are at high risk for complicated grief reactions such as absent grief, delayed grief, and prolonged or unresolved grief. Siblings are also at risk for complicated grief and require special attention. SPIRITUAL & CULTURAL SUPPORT Health care decisions are often intertwined with a family’s culture and belief system. Understanding the influences of a family’s beliefs and culture allows the practitioner to provide sensitive, appropriate care, particularly at the end of life. Interaction with members of the family’s faith and cultural communities can often be instrumental in helping both the care team and the community support of the family. Allow- ance for specific prayers, rituals, or other activities may help facilitate procedures and discussions. Families who speak a foreign language are at risk for inadequate support. They may have fewer opportunities to express their concerns and fears, ask questions, and validate their understanding due to language and cultural con- straints.

Children with primary immunodeficiency (PID) com- monly present with recurrent or severe infections, but most children with frequent minor infections (eg, otitis media or sinusitis) do not have an underlying immune disorder. Immunodeficiency should be considered when infections are severe, persistent, resistant to standard treatment, or caused by opportunistic organisms. Clinical patterns and recurring infections with certain types of microbes are indicative of specific immune deficiencies.

Understanding the role each category plays in host defense allows critical evaluation for possible immuno- deficiency as the cause of recurrent infections. IMMUNODEFICIENCY EVALUATION:  PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS Before evaluating for a defined primary immunodeficiency, consider conditions that increase susceptibility to infection, such as allergic rhinitis (causing sinusitis), cystic fibrosis (causing failure to thrive, pneumonia, and sinus disease), asthma (causing chronic cough and pneumonia), foreign bodies, and conditions that interfere with skin integrity. Also exclude common causes of secondary immunodeficiency such as HIV infection, malnutrition, drugs, and protein loss via gastroenteropathy or kidney disease. If a single site is involved, exclude anatomic defects and foreign bodies. Fig- ure 31–1 outlines the approach to considering PIDs. Key clinical patterns can indicate the likelihood of a PID, the category of immune impairment (Table 31–1), and some- times the specific PID. The frequency and severity of infections can be helpful when considering a PID. The Modell Founda- tion warning signs for PID are found in Figure 31–2. Children who meet two or more of these signs should be screened for PID. Age at the onset of infections can be a helpful clue, as defects in different arms of the immune system will present at typical ages. For instance, defects of phagocytes and cellular immunity typically present during the first months of life, whereas maternal antibody protects infants with antibody deficiency for 3–6 months. The type of infections should guide initial investigation, as antibody, complement, and phagocyte defects predispose mainly to bacterial infections; but diarrhea, superficial candidiasis, opportunistic infections, and severe herpesvirus infections are more characteristic of T-lymphocyte immunodeficiency. Combined immunodeficiency syndromes will present with a combination of infections typical for B- lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte deficiencies.

The level of laboratory investigation should be based on the clinical presentation and the suspected category of host immunity impairment.

The normal ranges of IgG, IgM, and IgA vary by age as the production by B lymphocytes matures (see Table 31–3 for normal ranges). Some patients may have normal immuno- globulin levels but do not make protective specific antibodies; other patients have abnormal immunoglobulin levels but make protective specific antibodies. When interpreting immunoglobulin concentrations, remember that infants have lower normal values compared with adults. Evaluation of specific antibodies includes isohemagglutinins, which are nat- urally occurring antibodies (except in patients with blood group AB) and are detectable by age 6 months. Additional testing options include tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus, rubella, and mumps antibody levels following immunization. Assessing antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide can be helpful in the face of repeated pneumococcal infec- tions, but as a screening tool it is often difficult to interpret, as the normal immune response to unconjugated polysaccharide vaccines may be weak or difficult to measure. The gold standard is preimmunization and postimmunization titers, with at least a threefold increase in titers 3 weeks postimmuni- zation. Obtaining T- and B-lymphocyte counts is recom- mended if an initial screen revealed very low immunoglobulin concentrations for all classes, as certain hypogammaglobuline- mic syndromes have low levels of or absent B lymphocytes (such as X-linked Bruton agammaglobulinemia). Protein elec- trophoresis can help identify the monoclonal increases seen in the oligoclonal gammopathy of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, and in heavy-chain diseases. Serum albumin should be measured in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia to exclude secondary deficiencies due to protein loss through bowel or kidneys. IgG or IgA subclass measurements may be abnormal in patients with varied immunodeficiency syndromes, but they are rarely helpful in an initial evaluation. Ballow M: Primary immunodeficiency disorders: Antibody defi- ciency. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002;109:581 [PMID: 11941303]. T Lymphocytes Initial laboratory screening for T lymphocytes includes a complete blood cell count with differential to evaluate for a decreased absolute lymphocyte count (< 1000/μL). Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests (such as Candida, teta- nus, or mumps) give good evidence for antigen-specific T- lymphocyte immunity, but a negative or anergic result is not helpful, as it may be due to young age, chronic illness, or poor test technique. Even T-lymphocyte deficiencies will often not manifest anergy until the impairment is severe (eg, AIDS). When T-lymphocyte abnormalities are ▲ Figure 31–1.

Rule out common causes of infection (asthma, foreign body) and secondary immunodeficiency (malnutrition, HIV).

Because proper B-lymphocyte function and antibody production is dependent on T- lymphocyte function, most T-lymphocyte deficiencies manifest as combined impairments. Tests of T-lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production can be supportive for characterizing immunodeficiency detected by initial tests, but they are not useful screening tests for children with chronic illness, recurrent infections, or young age; additionally, borderline function is often interpreted based on clinical correlation.

Complement Pathways (Figure 31–4) Deficiency of classic complement pathway components can be excluded by a normal hemolytic complement titer (CH50), for which the patient’s serum must be separated and frozen to –70°C within 30 minutes of collection to prevent autodegradation of complement components. Alternative complement pathway deficiencies are similarly identified by AH50. Measuring individual complement component levels is not necessary if both CH50 and AH50 are normal. If the CH50 and AH50 are both low, the deficiency must be in their shared terminal pathway (C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9). If CH50 is low, but AH50 is normal, the deficiency must be C1, C4, or C2; if AH50 is low and CH50 is normal, the deficiency must be factor D or B or properdin.

Associations also exist with inflammatory bowel dis- ease, allergic disease, asthma, and autoimmune disorders (thyroiditis, arthritis, vitiligo, thrombocytopenia, and diabe- tes). IgA is primarily effective in its secreted form on mucosal surfaces. IgA replacement is currently not feasible. For the major- ity of symptomatic IgA-deficient patients, antibiotics and appropriate autoimmune therapies are sufficient, but some patients have been treated with IVIG replacement. Caution must be exercised, as IgA-deficient patients are at risk for developing anti-IgA antibodies with blood product expo- sure, and the administration of blood products can result in anaphylaxis. Therefore when blood products are needed, washed packed red blood cells and volume expanders with- out blood products are recommended. The possibility that deficiency of an IgG subclass (ie, abnormally low serum IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) might predis- pose to recurrent upper respiratory tract infections in patients with normal total serum immunoglobulin levels is not well established. Normally, IgG1 comprises over 60% of total IgG and IgG2 over 10%. IgG3 accounts for about 5%, and IgG4 may be undetectable in up to 20% of healthy persons. Additionally, serum levels are age-related. It has been difficult to establish a link between IgG subclass defi- ciencies and any consistent pattern of infections. IgG replacement should be reserved for patients with defects in specific antibody production, which is rarely seen in patients with selective IgA or IgG subclass deficiencies. Treatment of Hypogammaglobulinemia The mainstay of therapy for hypogammaglobulinemia is replacement IgG, but management of infections is also important. Additional treatment modalities have included the use of cytokine therapy such as interleukin (IL)-2, hormone replacement, and vitamin supplementation. Cura- tive therapy with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been successful in patients with XLA. Gene therapy is not yet available outside a research setting. Replacement IgG is usually given by intravenous infusions at a dose of 400–600 mg/kg every 3–4 weeks to maintain trough serum IgG levels above 500–800 mg/dL (a higher trough level is targeted for patients with established pulmonary disease). Subcutaneous replacement is available but requires more frequent injec- tions and may limit maximum dosing. The aim of treatment is to prevent future infections and minimize any progression of chronic lung disease (bronchitis or bronchiectasis). Despite the passive immunity provided by replacement IgG, infection remains a persistent risk and prognosis additionally depends on timely and appropriate antibiotics. Typical infecting organisms include encapsulated bacteria, but Urea- plasma and Mycoplasma species must also be considered. Infusions are generally well tolerated, with most reactions being mild, including headache, back and limb pain, anxiety, and tightness of the chest. Rare systemic reactions can occur, including tachycardia, shivering, fever, and in severe cases, anaphylactoid shock. For patients with congenital hypogam- maglobulinemia, replacement therapy is currently lifelong.

921,Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases,Rheumatic Diseases ,3474,"SEVERE COMBINED  IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Onset in first year of life.  Recurrent infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and opportunistic pathogens.  Chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive.  Absent lymphoid tissue.  General Considerations Combined T- and B-lymphocyte diseases include severe combined immunodeficiency diseases (SCID) that encom- pass congenital diseases caused by different genetic muta- tions that result in severe deficiency of T and B lymphocytes. Despite differences in underlying mutations, affected pa- tients present similarly, with recurrent infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and opportunistic pathogens. Addi- tionally, patients often suffer from chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. Without treatment, all patients with SCID typically die within the first years of life. SCID must be considered in the differential diagnosis in any infant with diarrhea and hypogammaglobulinemia.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Common presentations include persistent cough, tachypnea or hypoxia secondary to underlying Pneumocystis carinii infection, or persistent oral or diaper candidiasis. Physical examination is notable for a lack of lymphoid tissue includ- ing tonsils and lymph nodes. A chest radiograph usually demonstrates an absent thymic shadow. B. Laboratory Findings Laboratory evaluation often reveals lymphopenia and some degree of hypogammaglobulinemia. Occasionally, an infant with SCID will present with normal numbers of lymphocytes resulting from transfusion-related engraftment or maternal T- lymphocyte engraftment via peripartum transfusion. Natural killer (NK) cells and B-lymphocyte numbers may be decreased,   IMMUNODEFICIENCY 901 1. X-Linked Severe  Combined Immunodeficiency X-linked SCID, the most common form (40%) of SCID, results from mutations in IL2RG (IL-2 receptor gene) that encodes the common γ chain. The γ-chain protein is shared by multiple cell surface receptors for cytokines that are essential for T-lymphocyte maturation, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. Within the first 3 months of life, male infants present with diarrhea, cough, and rash. Labora- tory evaluation reveals low T-lymphocyte numbers, normal numbers of B lymphocytes (which do not produce func- tional antibody), and absent NK cells. 2. Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency Adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) is an autosomal recessive form of SCID caused by absence of adenosine deaminase, which is important for removal of toxic metabo- lites formed in T lymphocytes, including adenosine, 2' deoxy- adenosine, and 2'O-methyladeosine. Increased levels of these metabolites result in T-lymphocyte death. Subsequently, affected patients develop complete absence of T-lymphocyte function. ADA SCID is distinguished from other variants of SCID by the following findings: the most profound lym- phopenia (< 500/mm3); skeletal abnormalities, including chondro-osseous dysplasia (flared costochondral junctions and bone-in-bone anomalies in vertebrae); and deficiency of all types of lymphocytes. Diagnosis is suspected in patients with profound lymphopenia and recurrent infections. The diagnosis is confirmed with a red blood cell assay for ADA activity. The genetic mutation is on chromosome 20q13.2– 13.11. In addition to BMT, restoration of immune compe- tence can occur in some patients with weekly infusions of polyethylene glycol–stabilized ADA enzyme conjugate. Gene therapy of stem cells with an ADA-incorporating retroviral vector has been successful, but the vector had oncogenic adverse effects. The development of safer vectors is yet to come. 3. Janus Kinase 3 Deficiency Another form of autosomal recessive SCID is due to muta- tions in the gene encoding janus kinase 3, which is important for intracellular signaling through the common γ chain. The clinical presentation and lymphocyte phenotype most closely resembles X-linked SCID, with low T and NK lymphocytes, and elevated, nonfunctional B lymphocytes. 4. Interleukin-7-Receptor- Alpha-Chain Deficiency IL-7-receptor-alpha-chain (IL-7Rα) deficiency SCID is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance. The IL-7 receptor is important for T-lymphocyte maturation and mutations result in low T-lymphocyte numbers, but normal numbers of dysfunctional B lymphocytes and NK cells. 5. Recombinase-Activating  Gene Deficiencies Another form of autosomal recessive SCID is due to muta- tions in recombinase activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2), which encode proteins critical for assembling antigen recep- tor genes for both T and B lymphocytes. Several mutations in these genes have been described. The clinical presentation is similar to that of other forms of SCID, but the lymphocyte phenotype differs, as patients with SCID due to RAG1 or RAG2 mutations lack both T and B lymphocytes, but main- tain normal or elevated numbers of NK cells. Omenn syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by SCID, eczematoid rash, hepatosplenomeg- aly, lymphadenopathy, and alopecia. The disease is caused by mutations in RAG1, RAG2, or Artemis (see below). Labora- tory evaluation reveals absent B lymphocytes, normal to elevated T-lymphocyte numbers with restricted function, and normal functional NK cells. Additionally, affected patients often have eosinophilia and elevated levels of IgE. The syndrome is typically fatal, although BMT has been used. Ege M et al: Ommen syndrome due to ARTEMIS mutations. Blood 2005;105:4179 [PMID: 15731174]. 6. CD3-Delta-Chain Deficiency CD3-delta-chain (CD3δ) deficiency is a rare form of autoso- mal recessive SCID. Homozygous defects in the CD3δ chain halt T-lymphocyte maturation. Clinical presentation and lymphocyte phenotype are similar to IL-7Rα deficiency, but CD3δ-chain deficiency differs from other forms of SCID in that these patients have a normal appearing thymic silhou- ette on chest radiograph. Dadi H et al: Effect of CD3δ deficiency on maturation of alpha/ beta and gamma/delta T-cell lineages in severe combined immunodeficiency. N Engl J Med 2003;349:1821 [PMID: 14602880]. 7. CD45 Deficiency Another rare form of autosomal recessive SCID is due to mutations in the gene for CD45. CD45 is a tyrosine phospha- tase important for regulating signal transduction. Affected patients have a similar presentation to other forms of SCID and a lymphocyte phenotype with low to absent T and NK cells, but elevated B lymphocytes. 8. Artemis Deficiency Artemis is a DNA repair factor important for repairing cuts in the double-stranded DNA essential for the assembly of antigen receptors for T and B lymphocytes. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, and clinical presentation and lympho- cyte phenotype are similar to those seen in RAG1 and RAG2 deficiencies. "

924,Other Combined Immunodeficiency  Disorders,Rheumatic Diseases ,695,"OTHER COMBINED  IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISORDERS Combined immunodeficiencies include defects that directly impair both T and B lymphocytes, as well as T-lymphocyte– specific defects, because proper B-lymphocyte function and antibody production are dependent on T-lymphocyte func- tion. Therefore, most T-lymphocyte deficiencies manifest as combined impairments. 1. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Immunodeficiency with recurrent infections.  Microplatelet thrombocytopenia.  Eczema.  Occurs only in males.  General Considerations Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive dis- ease characterized by immunodeficiency, microplatelet throm- bocytopenia, and eczema. The syndrome results from mutations of the gene encoding WASP at X11p. WASP is a protein involved in the rearrangement of actin and is important in interactions between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Common presenting symptoms include bloody diarrhea, cere- bral hemorrhage, and severe infections with polysaccharide- encapsulated bacteria, but clinical presentation can vary from classic severe WAS to mild thrombocytopenia without immu- nodeficiency, or X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), depending on the mutation. Early deaths are due to bleeding and infections, but malignancies and autoimmune syndromes can develop over time. Survival beyond adolescence is rare in patients not receiv- ing treatment, although XLT is sometimes diagnosed in adults. B. Laboratory Findings Laboratory findings that suggest the diagnosis are a low platelet count, low or absent isohemagglutinins, and reduced antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens (S pneumoniae and H influenzae). IgM may be low; IgA and IgE are often high.  Differential Diagnosis In addition to WAS and XLT, the differential diagnosis in a patient with a low platelet count must include other causes of platelet consumption, destruction, and abnormal produc- tion, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia or myelodysplasia, drug adverse effect, and infection. WAS can be differentiated from these other conditions by small- sized platelets on smear evaluation, the presence of eczema (and atopy), and documented immune dysfunction. Addi- tionally, there is a continuum between WAS and XLT that lacks immunodeficiency. Subsequently, a scoring system has been developed to help clinicians distinguish WAS from XLT.  Treatment Treatment includes infection prophylaxis with antibiotics (including trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for P carinii pneu- monia) and IgG replacement therapy for patients with defi- cient antibody responses. Splenectomy to reduce thrombocy- topenia has been helpful in some patients with XLT but must be followed by antibiotic prophylaxis because of the increased risk of septicemia and sudden death. Platelet transfusions should be avoided unless severe bleeding has occurred. Finally, BMT using the best-matched donor offers the possibility of a definitive cure, but is associated with morbidity and mortality.

Immunodeficiency Due to Mutations  of Nuclear Factor-κB–Essential Modulator Immunodeficiency due to mutations in the gene for nuclear factor-κB–essential modulator (NEMO) is an X-linked syn- drome in which male patients manifest ectodermal dysplasia (abnormal teeth, fine sparse hair, and abnormal or absent sweat glands) and defects of T- and B-lymphocytes. Many mutations are fatal in utero for male infants. Female carriers may have incontinentia pigmenti. The mutation results in abnormal immunoreceptor signaling. Surviving males present with early serious infections, including opportunistic infec- tions such as Pneumocystis and atypical mycobacteria. Labo- ratory evaluation reveals hypogammaglobulinemia and poor specific antibody production, but normal numbers of T and B lymphocytes. Functional evaluation of lymphocytes dem- onstrates variable response. Because patients with confirmed NEMO mutations are quite rare, the best treatment course is unknown, but aggressive antibiotic therapy in combination with IVIG as well as BMT has been used. Prognosis is dependent on the severity of immunodeficiency, with most deaths due to infection.

Combined Immunodeficiency  with Defective Expression of Major  Histocompatibility Complex Types I & II Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) deficiency or bare lymphocyte syndrome type I is an autosomal reces- sive combined immunodeficiency. Affected patients have abnormal TAP proteins important for intracellular transport and expression of MHC I on cell surfaces. Patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome type I present with recurrent sinopul- monary and skin infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating an absence of MHC I expression. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) defi- ciency or bare lymphocyte syndrome type II is a rare autoso- mal recessive combined immunodeficiency in which cells lack MHC II expression. Clinical presentation includes recurrent viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II have normal numbers of T and B lymphocytes, but low CD4+ lymphocyte numbers, abnor- mal lymphocyte function, and hypogammaglobulinemia. They also have a high incidence of sclerosing cholangitis. When this diagnosis is suspected, demonstration of absent MHC class II molecules confirms the disorder. Severe cases are fatal without BMT, but milder phenotypes may be man- aged with IVIG replacement and aggressive use of antibiotics. Nekrep N et al: When the lymphocyte loses its clothes. Immunity 2003:18;453 [PMID: 12705848]. 7. Diseases Due to Defective Interferon  Gamma & Interleukin-12 Pathways The interferon-γ and IL-12 pathways are critical for macro- phage, T-lymphocyte, and NK cell immunity toward myco- bacterial infections. Multiple defects have been described in both the receptors for these cytokines and the receptors for signal transducer and activator of transcription molecules, with affected patients variably susceptible to atypical myco- bacteria or infection after bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccina- tion. Age of onset is variable, and symptoms can manifest in early adulthood. Treatment with supplemental interferon-γ is effective for some patients in combination with appropri- ate antibiotics. Most patients should also receive long-term mycobacterial prophylaxis. Fieschi C, Casanova JL: The role of interleukin-12 in human infectious diseases: Only a faint signature.

Purine Nucleoside  Phosphorylase Deficiency Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is an immunodeficiency due to defects in the gene encoding PNP, which is important in the purine salvage pathway. Deficiency of PNP causes toxic metabolites that result in T-lymphocyte death, but in many patients B lymphocytes are spared. This autosomal recessive disease not only results in recurrent and serious infections, but affected patients have concomitant neurologic (developmental delay, ataxia, and spasticity) and autoimmune disorders. Infections present at variable ages. Laboratory evaluation reveals low numbers of or absent T lymphocytes and a variable B-lymphocyte deficiency. With- out BMT, this disease is fatal due to infection or malignancy. Dror Y et al: Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency associated with a dysplastic marrow morphology.

926,Phagocytic Defects,Rheumatic Diseases ,4814,"PHAGOCYTIC DEFECTS Phagocytic defects include abnormalities of both numbers (neu- tropenia) and function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neu- trophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Functional defects consist of impairments in adhesion, chemotaxis, or bacterial killing. 1. Neutropenia Evaluation for the presence of neutropenia should be included when considering recurrent infections. The diagno- sis and treatment of neutropenia is discussed in Chapter 28. Additionally, some primary immunodeficiency syndromes are associated with neutropenia (eg, XLA).   CHAPTER 31 906  Treatment Treatment includes aggressive antibiotic therapy. LAD II is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by an inborn error in fucose metabolism that results in abnormal expression of sialyl-Lewis X (CD15s), which functions as a selectin ligand. The resulting phenotype is similar to LAD I, characterized by recurrent infections, lack of pus formation, poor wound healing, and periodontal disease, but additionally, LAD II patients have developmental delays, short stature, dysmor- phic facies, and the Bombay (hh) blood group. Diagnosis is confirmed by flow cytometry analysis for CD15s, and treat- ment is usually limited to antibiotics, although fucose sup- plementation has been reported with some success. 4. Glucose-6-Phosphate  Dehydrogenase Deficiency Severe forms of X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogen- ase deficiency result in recurrent infections and increased risk of severe malarial infection due to abnormal neutrophil respiratory burst. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase–asso- ciated immunodeficiency is much less common than the associated hemolytic anemia. 5. Myeloperoxidase Deficiency Leukocyte myeloperoxidase is important for intracellular destruction of Candida albicans. Although deficiency is quite common, few patients present with recurrent or chronic candidal infections. Diagnosis can be confirmed with assays measuring myeloperoxidase levels in leukocytes. Sympto- matic and prophylactic antifungal therapy is often necessary in patients with recurrent infections. The myeloperoxidase gene has been localized to chromosome 17. "
928,Complement Defects,Rheumatic Diseases ,1587,"COMPLEMENT DEFECTS As a component of the innate immune system, complement works through opsonization, lysis of target cells, and recruit- ment of phagocytic cells, and by facilitating antibody-medi- ated immunity. The complement system includes three pathways of enzymatic reactions: classical, alternative, and lectin (see Figure 31–4). All three pathways share C3 cleavage and result in promotion of inflammation, elimination of pathogens, and enhancement of the immune system response. Activation of the complement system occurs through bacterial proteins and surface-bound IgG and IgM antibodies. 1. Complement Factor Deficiencies Rare deficiencies of individual complement factors (C1–C9) are inherited by autosomal recessive transmission. Deficien- cies of factors C1, C2, and C4 do not predispose to increased infections, but are associated with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Primary C3 deficiency presents with severe pyogenic infections, as C3 is critical for opsonization in both the classical and alternative pathways. There are also acquired forms of C3 deficiency that predis- pose patients to similar infectious risks. Terminal comple- ment factor deficiency (C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9) or proper- din (an alternative pathway factor) deficiency results in recurrent infections with Neisseria species. Survivors of men- ingococcal meningitis and patients with recurrent neisserial infections should be screened for such a deficiency. Deficiency of mannose-binding lectin has been linked to increased risk of infections, but recent studies have been unable to confirm deficiency as a risk factor.

Hereditary Angioedema  Due to C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Recurrent episodes of angioedema.  No associated urticaria or pruritus.  Onset at any age.  General Considerations Hereditary angioedema is a rare autosomal dominant disor- der caused by C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency in which susceptibility to infection is not increased. There is also an acquired form associated with angiotensin-convert- ing enzyme inhibitor medication use or some B-lymphocyte malignancies.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Affected patients can experience edema of skin and bowel and potentially life-threatening edema of the airway. Typical sites of swelling include the face, extremities, and genitals. Trauma, accidental or intentional (eg, due to surgery, child- birth, or dental work), may induce edema. Typical problems include episodic intestinal obstruction and dental proce- dure-induced upper airway obstruction. The edema is usu- ally nonpainful (unless it involves the bowel) and lasts 48–72 hours. There is no associated urticaria (ie, redness) or pruri- tus. Age of onset is quite variable, and there is often a positive family history.   IMMUNODEFICIENCY 907 B. Laboratory Findings Initial screening tests for complement that show decreased CH50 or low levels of C4 suggest the diagnosis. Confirma- tion comes from demonstration of low or absent levels of C1-INH or poor or absent C1-INH function. Additionally, C2 and C4 levels are low, and C1q is normal.  Differential Diagnosis Other causes of acquired angioedema, including that associ- ated with certain medications (most notably angiotensin- converting enzyme modifying drugs), autoimmune diseases, and lymphoproliferative diseases, should be considered. Hereditary angioedema is distinguished from the acquired form of the disorder by normal levels of C1q.  Treatment Intravenous C1-INH concentrate is the treatment of choice for the emergency management of acute edema (eg, laryn- geal or diffuse facial edema, severe abdominal attacks). Volume replacement is often needed due to fluid loss from edema. Fresh-frozen plasma may be used if C1-INH concen- trate is not available. Long-term prophylaxis is a consider- ation when attacks occur monthly or have been life-threat- ening. The synthetic androgen danazol prevents attacks by increasing C1-INH levels. Antifibrinolytic agents (eg, tran- examic acid) may have a preferable adverse effects profile to androgens. For short-term prophylaxis prior to dental or surgical procedures, C1-INH concentrate is preferred; tranexamic acid, danazol, or fresh-frozen plasma can also be used.

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare X-linked disorder with variable disease expression in which affected patients have intravascular hemolysis, bone marrow failure, and thrombosis, but no associated immune defect. Paroxys- mal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is caused by a mutation in phosphatidylinositol-glycan complementation class A, which is critical for certain erythrocyte surface proteins. Without these surface proteins, erythrocytes are highly sus- ceptible to complement-mediated lysis. Thrombotic events, particularly intra-abdominal, are the major cause of death. Additional morbidity and mortality is due to bone marrow failure and associated bone marrow malignancies.

929,Other Well-Defined Immunodeficiency  Syndromes,Rheumatic Diseases ,2635,"OTHER WELL-DEFINED  IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROMES 1. Hyper-IgE Syndrome Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), also known as Job syndrome, is a rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by elevated levels of IgE (> 2000 IU/mL), neonatal eczematoid rash, recurrent infections with S aureus, recurrent pneumonia with pneumatocele formation, and typical facies. Inheritance ap- pears to be sporadic, although autosomal dominant and re- cessive cases have been reported. Additional clinical findings include retained primary teeth, scoliosis, hyperextensibility, high palate, and osteoporosis. In addition to staphylococcal infections, affected patients also have increased incidence of infections due to Streptococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp, C albicans, and even opportunistic infections with Pneumocystis carinii. Laboratory evaluation reveals normal to profoundly elevated levels of IgE and occasionally an associated eosino- philia. However, elevated IgE levels themselves are not a risk factor for HIES, as atopic dermatitis and parasite infection are much more common causes of elevated IgE. Diagnosis is often difficult due to variable presentation, which may be- come progressively severe with increasing age. Subsequently, diagnosis is often only made over time and evolving syn- drome characteristics. The underlying cause of HIES is un- known. The mainstay of treatment is prophylactic and symp- tomatic antibiotic use in combination with good skin care. IVIG has been used with some success to decrease infections and possibly modify IgE levels. Grimbacher B et al: Hyper-IgE syndromes. Immunol Rev 2005;203:244 [PMID: 15661034]. 2. Immune Dysregulation,  Polyendocrinopathy,  Enteropathy, X-Linked Syndrome Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome is a rare disease that usually manifests with severe diarrhea and insulin-dependent diabe- tes mellitus within the first months of life. Affected males also have severe eczema, food allergy, autoimmune cytope- nias, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and recurrent infec- tions. Most die before 2 years of age due to malnutrition or sepsis. IPEX syndrome results from mutations in the FOXP3 gene that encodes a protein essential for developing regula- tory T lymphocytes. Leukocyte counts and immunoglobulin levels are generally normal. Immunosuppression and nutri- tional supplementation produce temporary improvements, but the prognosis is poor and most cases result in early death. BMT has been attempted with variable success.

Arch Dermatol 2004;140:466 [PMID: 15096376]. 3. X-Linked  Lymphoproliferative Syndrome X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an immunodefi- ciency that develops following EBV infection. Affected males develop fulminant infectious mononucleosis with hemo- phagocytic syndrome, multiple organ system failure, and bone marrow aplasia. The mutated gene encodes a signaling protein used by T lymphocytes and NK cells called SLAM- adapter protein. Affected boys are immunologically normal prior to EBV infection, and during acute infection they produce antibody to EBV. In most instances, infection with EBV is fatal. Patients who survive the initial episode or who are never infected with EBV in childhood develop lympho- mas, vasculitis, hypogammaglobulinemias (with elevated IgM) or common variable immunodeficiency in later life. Antenatal diagnosis is possible. Latour S, Veilette A: Molecular and immunological basis of X- linked lymphoproliferative disease. Immunol Rev 2003;192: 221 [PMID: 12670406]. 4. Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis There are two forms of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). The first type is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by isolated candidal infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes, and is not due to other causes. Systemic disease is not characteristic, but case reports of intracranial mycotic aneurysms exist. Primary CMC most commonly occurs as an isolated syndrome, but can be associated with endocrine or autoimmune disorders. The underlying defect is unknown, but the prognosis is quite good with antifungal therapy. An autosomal recessive form of CMC with associated autoimmunity, also known as autoimmune polyendocrinop- athy, candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia (APECED) syndrome, is characterized by recurrent candidal infections, abnormal T-lymphocyte response to Candida, autoimmune endocri- nopathies, and ectodermal dystrophies. APECED is caused by mutations in the gene for an important transcription regulator protein called autoimmune regulator that is critical for normal thymocyte development. Treatment includes antifungal therapy in combination with therapy for associ- ated endocrinopathies. Lawrence T et al: Autosomal-dominant primary immunodeficien- cies.

Autoimmune  Lymphoproliferative Syndrome Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) results from mutations of genes important for regulating pro- grammed lymphocyte death (apoptosis). Most commonly, the defect is in Fas (CD95) or Fas ligand, but other defects in the Fas pathway have also been described (eg, caspase 10). Clinical presentation includes lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmune disorders (autoimmune hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and sometimes arthritis). Occasionally, patients have frequent infections. The diagnosis is suspected when T-lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry demonstrate elevated numbers of CD3+CD4–CD8– (double negative) T lymphocytes. Sev- eral different types of ALPS are distinguished by the response of lymphocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis. Pa- tients are often heterozygous, and inheritance is mostly autosomal dominant. Treatment with prednisone often controls the lymphadenopathy. Infections should be treated appropriately. In some cases, BMT has been cura- tive. Affected patients are also at risk for lymphoma. Mutations affecting another apoptosis-related protein, caspase 8, cause an ALPS variant syndrome in which the susceptibility to infection by herpes simplex virus also increases.

930,Genetic Syndromes Associated with  Immunodeficiency,Rheumatic Diseases ,4177,"GENETIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED  WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCY Several described genetic syndromes have associated immu- nodeficiency that is often identified after the syndrome has been diagnosed. Usually, the immune defect is not the major presenting clinical problem. Ming JE et al: Genetic syndromes associated with immunodefi- ciency. Immunol Allergy Clin North Am 2002;22:261. Ming JE, Stiehm ER: Syndromic immunodeficiencies with humoral defects. Immunol Allergy Clin North Am 2001;21:91. 1. Bloom Syndrome Characteristics of Bloom syndrome include growth retarda- tion, sun sensitivity, and telangiectasias of the face. The syndrome results from mutations in a DNA helicase that lead to excess sister chromatid exchanges. Affected patients have an increased risk of malignancy and life-threatening infec- tions. Serum IgA and IgM are variably low, and T-lympho- cyte function is abnormal.   IMMUNODEFICIENCY 909 2. Transcobalamin 2 Deficiency Transcobalamin 2 deficiency is due to defective cellular transport of cobalamin and results in megaloblastic anemia, diarrhea, and poor growth. Affected patients have hypogam- maglobulinemia and poor specific antibody production. 3. Immunodeficiency, Centromeric  Instability, Facial Anomalies Syndrome Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is a rare condition caused by abnormal DNA methyltransferase. Unlike other chromosome instabil- ity syndromes, ICF syndrome does not have an associated hypersensitivity to sunlight. Affected patients have severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, and skin infections due to low or absent immunoglobulins and abnormal T-lymphocyte numbers and function. 4. Trisomy 21 Patients with trisomy 21 or Down syndrome have increased susceptibility to respiratory infection. Immunodeficiency is variable, and abnormal numbers and function of T and B lymphocytes have been reported. Additionally, patients have an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. 5. Turner Syndrome Turner syndrome (partial or complete absence of one X chromosome) is associated with increased risk of otitis media, respiratory infections, and malignancies. Immune defects are variable but may include abnormal T-lymphocyte numbers and function and hypogammaglobulinemia. 6. Chédiak-Higashi Syndrome Chédiak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in a lysosomal trafficking gene. The neutrophils of affected individuals have giant lysosomes, impaired chemotaxis, neutropenia, and abnormal NK-cell cytotoxicity. Patients present with recurrent infections (par- ticularly periodontitis), partial oculocutaneous albinism, and neuropathy. Most patients progress to generalized lym- phohistiocytic infiltration syndrome, which is a common cause of death. Treatment strategies address infections and neuropathy and the use of immunosuppression attempts to slow lymphoproliferative progression. 7. Griscelli Syndrome Characterized by partial albinism, neutropenia, thrombocy- topenia, and lymphohistiocytosis, Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome resulting from mutations in the myosin VA gene. Affected patients have recurrent and serious infections caused by fungi, viruses, and bacteria. Immunologic evaluation demonstrates variable immuno- globulin levels and antibody function with impaired T- lymphocyte function. BMT can correct the immunodefi- ciency. Griscelli syndrome is distinguished from Chédiak- Higashi syndrome by the lack of granules in white blood cells. 8. Netherton Syndrome Patients with the autosomal recessive Netherton syndrome present with trichorrhexis (brittle hair), ichthyosiform rash, and allergic diseases. A subset of patients develops recurrent infections. Immune function is variable but may include hypo- or hypergammaglobulinemia, abnormal T-lympho- cyte function, or abnormal phagocyte function. The disease results from mutations in a serine protease inhibitor encoded on the SPINK5 gene. 9. Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia Cartilage-hair hypoplasia is an autosomal recessive form of chondrodysplasia manifesting with short-limbed short stature, hypoplastic hair, defective immunity, and poor erythrogenesis. The immune defect is characterized by mild to moderate lymphopenia and abnormal lymphocyte function, but normal antibody function. Affected patients have increased susceptibility to infections and increased risk of lymphoma. The disorder results from mutation in the RMRP gene that encodes the RNA component of an RNase MRP complex. BMT can restore cell-mediated immunity but does not correct the cartilage or hair abnormalities.

931,Graft-Versus-Host Disease,Rheumatic Diseases ,3909,"GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs when immuno- logically competent donor T lymphocytes are grafted into a host who is unable to reject them. The immunocompetent donor T lymphocytes recognize the host as foreign, leading to significant morbidity and potentially death. In addition to BMT-associated disease, GVHD can also occur in immuno- deficient patients who receive nonirradiated blood products (ie, containing liver donor T lymphocytes) or engraftment of maternally derived T lymphocytes during birth. A progres- sive skin rash followed by diarrhea, hepatitis, nephritis, pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and marrow damage character- ize GVHD. Laboratory evaluation reveals eosinophilia and leukocytosis, and diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Preven- tion is the most successful approach to GVHD. With BMT, GVHD prophylactic immunosuppressant regimens include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Treatment of GVHD includes similar regimens in addition to antithymocyte serum, corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies directed against T lymphocytes.   911 32 Endocrine Disorders Philip S.

933,General Concepts,Hematologic Disorders ,139,"GENERAL CONCEPTS The classic concept that hormones are secreted substances affecting distant target cells has been updated to account for other mechanisms of hormonal action. Some hormones stimulate or inhibit metabolic processes in neighboring, not distant cells (eg, pancreatic islets or cartilage). This mecha- nism is termed paracrine activity. Other hormones affect the cells that produce them, a mechanism termed autocrine. Recognition that insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, and other hormones are synthesized by the brain and gut supports the concept of paracrine and auto- crine processes in these tissues. Another concept of modern endocrine physiology is that specific hormone receptors in target tissues are required for hormonal action. For example, in the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, androgen receptors are defective and affected males have varying degrees of undervirilization of the external genitalia and wolffian duct system despite having both testes (the end organ) and adequate testosterone (the hormone). Similarly, in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or pseudohypoparathyroidism, affected children have defective antidiuretic hormone or parathyroid hormone receptor func- tion, respectively, and have diabetes insipidus or hypoparathy- roidism, despite adequate hormone secretion. Alternatively, abnormal activation of a hormone receptor leads to the effects of the hormone in the absence of excessive hormone secretion. Examples of this phenomenon are the McCune-Albright syn- drome (precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism), testotoxi- cosis (familial male precocious puberty), and hypercalciuric hypocalcemia. HORMONE TYPES Hormones are of three main chemical types: peptides and proteins, steroids, and amines. The peptide hormones include those released by the anterior and posterior pitu- itary, pancreatic islet cells, parathyroids, lungs (angiotensin II), heart and brain (atrial and brain natriuretic hormones), and hypothalamus (releasing hormones), as well as many local growth factors (insulin-like growth factor-1). Steroid hormones are secreted primarily by the adrenal cortex, gonads, and kidney (active vitamin D [1,25(OH)2 D3]). The amine hormones are secreted by the adrenal medulla (epi- nephrine) and the thyroid gland (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]). As a rule, the peptide hormones and epinephrine act rapidly and bind to specific receptors on the surface of their target cell. The metabolic effects of these hormones are usually stimulation or inhibition of the activity of cellular enzymes or transport proteins (post-translational effects). The steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and active vitamin D, in contrast, act more slowly and bind to specific cytoplas- mic receptors in the target cell and subsequently to specific regions (genes) on nuclear DNA, where they direct a read- out of specific protein(s). Their metabolic effects are gener- ally stimulation or inhibition of the synthesis of enzymes or transport proteins (transcriptional effects), which increases or decreases the amount rather than the activity of these pro- teins in the target cell. Metabolic processes that must be regulated rapidly such as blood glucose or calcium are usually under the control of the peptide hormones and epinephrine, whereas processes regulated more slowly such as pubertal development and metabolic rate are under the control of steroid hormones and thyroid hormone. Control of electrolyte homeostasis is intermediate and is regulated by a combination of peptide and steroid hormones (Table 32–1). FEEDBACK CONTROL OF HORMONE SECRETION An understanding of feedback control of hormonal secretion is fundamental to the understanding of endocrine disorders of childhood and their treatment. Hormone secretion is generally regulated by feedback in response to changes in the internal environment (see Table 32–1). When the metabolic imbalance  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use.    CHAPTER 32 912 is corrected, the stimulus for the hormone’s secretion ceases or is inhibited. Overcorrection of the imbalance stimulates secre- tion of a counterbalancing hormone or hormones. Hypothalamic-pituitary control of hormone secretion is also regulated by feedback, so that end-organ failure (endo- crine gland insufficiency) causing decreased circulating endocrine gland hormones results in increased secretion of their respective hypothalamic releasing and pituitary hor- mones (Table 32–1 and Figure 32–1). If restoration of normal circulating concentrations of hormones occurs, feed- back inhibition at the pituitary and hypothalamus results in cessation of the previously stimulated secretion of releasing and pituitary hormones and restoration of their circulating concentrations to normal. Similarly, if there is autonomous endocrine gland hyperfunction (eg, McCune-Albright syn- drome, Graves disease, or adrenal tumor), the specific hypo- thalamic releasing and pituitary hormones are suppressed (see Figure 32–1).

934,Disturbances of Growth,Hematologic Disorders ,1035,"DISTURBANCES OF GROWTH Disturbance of growth and development is the most com- mon problem evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist. While most cases represent normal developmental variants, it is critical to identify abnormal growth patterns, as devia- tions from the norm can be the first or only manifestation of many endocrine disorders. Determination of height velocity is the most critical factor in evaluating a child’s growth. A persistent increase or decrease in height percentiles between age 2 years and the onset of puberty always warrants evalua- tion. It is more difficult to distinguish normal from abnor- mal growth in the first 2 years of life, as infants may have catch-up or catch-down growth during this period. Appropriate standards must be used to evaluate growth. The National Center for Health Statistics provides standard growth charts for North American children (see Chapter 1).

942,Disorders of the Posterior Pituitary Gland,Hematologic Disorders ,398,"DISORDERS OF THE  POSTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND The posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) is an extension of the ventral hypothalamus. Its two principal hormones— oxytocin and arginine vasopressin—are synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the ventral hypo- thalamus. After synthesis, these peptide hormones are pack- aged in granules with specific neurophysins and transported via the axons to their storage site in the posterior pituitary. Vasopressin is essential for water balance; it acts primarily on the kidney to promote reabsorption of water from urine. Oxytocin is most active during parturition and breast feed- ing and is not discussed further here. ARGININE VASOPRESSIN  (ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE) PHYSIOLOGY Vasopressin release is controlled primarily by serum osmo- lality and intravascular volume. Release is stimulated by minor increases in plasma osmolality (detected by osmore- ceptors in the anterolateral hypothalamus) and large decreases in intravascular volume (detected by barorecep- tors in the cardiac atria). Disorders of vasopressin release and action include (1) central (neurogenic) diabetes insipi- dus, (2) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (see Chapter 22), and (3) the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidi- uretic hormone (see Chapter 43). CENTRAL DIABETES INSIPIDUS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Polydipsia, polyuria (> 2 L/m2/d), nocturia, dehydration, and hypernatremia.  Inability to concentrate urine after fluid restriction (urine specific gravity < 1.010; urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg).  Plasma osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg with urine osmola- lity < 600 mOsm/kg.  Low plasma vasopressin with antidiuretic response to exogenous vasopressin.  General Considerations Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is an inability to synthesize and release vasopressin. Without vasopressin the kidneys cannot concentrate urine, causing excessive urinary water loss. Genetic causes of central DI are rare and include mutations in the vasopressin gene (mostly in the neuro- physin portion of the vasopressin precursor) and the WFS1 gene that causes DI, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness (Wolfram or DIDMOAD syndrome). Midline brain abnormalities, such as septo-optic dysplasia and holo- prosencephaly are also associated with central DI. Trau- matic brain injury or neurosurgery in or near the hypothal- amus or pituitary can cause transient or permanent DI. Traumatic DI often has three phases. Initially, transient DI is caused by edema in the hypothalamus or pituitary area. In 2–5 days, unregulated release of vasopressin from dying neurons causes the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Finally, permanent DI occurs if a sufficient number of vasopressin neurons are destroyed. Tumors and infiltrative diseases of the hypothalamus and pituitary may cause DI. In children with craniopharyngioma, DI usually develops after neurosurgical intervention. In contrast, germinomas often present with DI. Germinomas may be undetectable for several years; consequently, children with unexplained DI should have regularly repeated mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI). Infiltrative diseases such as histiocytosis and lymphocytic hypophysitis can cause DI. In these conditions, as in germinomas, MRI scans characteristi- cally show thickening of the pituitary stalk. Infections involving the base of the brain also cause transient DI.  Clinical Findings Onset of DI is often abrupt, characterized by polyuria, nocturia, enuresis, and intense thirst. Children with DI typically crave cold water. Hypernatremia, hyperosmolality, and dehydration occur if insufficient fluid intake due to lack of access or impaired thirst mechanism does not keep up with urinary losses. In infants, symptoms may also include failure to thrive, vomiting, constipation, and unexplained fevers. Some infants may present with severe dehydration, circulatory collapse, and seizures. Vasopressin deficiency may be masked in patients with panhypopituitarism due to the impaired excretion of free water associated with adrenal insufficiency. Treating these patients with glucocorticoids may unmask their DI. DI is confirmed when serum hyperosmolality is associ- ated with urine hypo-osmolarity. If the history indicates that the child can go through the night comfortably without drinking, outpatient testing is appropriate. Oral fluid intake is prohibited after midnight. Osmolality, sodium, and spe- cific gravity of the first morning void are obtained. If urine specific gravity is greater than 1.015, DI is excluded. If urine is not concentrated, a blood sample is obtained within a few    ENDOCRINE DISORDERS 921 minutes of the urine collection for osmolality, sodium, creatinine, and calcium concentration. If screening results are unclear or if symptoms preclude safely withholding fluids at home, a water deprivation test performed in the hospital is indicated. In this test, fluid is withheld and the child is monitored. Serum osmolality greater than 290 mOsm/kg associated with inappropriately dilute urine; osmolality less than 600 mOsm/kg is diagnostic for DI. Low serum vasopressin concentration and an antidi- uretic response to vasopressin administration at the end of the test distinguishes central from nephrogenic DI. Children with central DI should have a head MRI scan with contrast to look for tumors or infiltrative processes. The posterior pituitary “bright spot” on MRI is often absent in DI. Decreased ability to concentrate urine also occurs in hypercalcemic disorders and renal tubular abnormalities (eg, Fanconi syndrome). Primary polydipsia must be dis- tinguished from DI. Children with primary polydipsia tend to have lower serum sodium levels and usually can concen- trate their urine with overnight fluid deprivation. Some may have secondary nephrogenic DI due to dilution of the renal medullary interstitium and decreased renal concen- trating ability, but this resolves with restriction of fluid intake.  Treatment Central DI is treated with oral or intranasal desmopressin acetate (DDAVP). The aim of therapy is to provide antidi- uresis that allows uninterrupted sleep and approximately 1 hour of diuresis before the next dose. Children hospitalized with acute-onset DI can be managed with intravenous vaso- pressin. Due to the amount of antidiuresis, intravenous fluids will need to be restricted to two-thirds the mainte- nance rate and electrolytes closely monitored to avoid water intoxication. Infants with DI should not be treated with DDAVP. Treatment with DDAVP in association with the volume of formula or breast milk needed to ensure adequate caloric intake could cause water intoxication. For this rea- son, infants are treated with extra free water, rather than DDAVP, to maintain normal hydration. A formula with a low renal solute load and chlorothiazides may be helpful in infants with central DI.

943,Thyroid Gland,Hematologic Disorders ,2875,"THYROID GLAND FETAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE THYROID The fetal thyroid synthesizes thyroid hormone as early as the 10th week of gestation. Thyroid hormone appears in fetal serum by the 11th week of gestation and increases throughout gestation. The fetal pituitary-thyroid axis functions largely independently of the maternal pituitary- thyroid axis because maternal thyroid-stimulating hor- mone (TSH) cannot cross the placenta. However, maternal thyroid hormone can cross the placenta in limited amounts. A TSH surge occurs at birth, peaking at about 70 mU/L within 30–60 minutes. The surge causes thyroid hormone levels to increase rapidly in the first days of life. TSH level decreases to childhood levels within a few weeks. This physiologic neonatal TSH surge can cause a false-positive newborn screen for hypothyroidism (ie, high TSH) if the blood sample is collected on the first day of life. PHYSIOLOGY Hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stim- ulates the anterior pituitary gland to release TSH. In turn, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to take up iodine, and to synthesize and release the active hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). This process is regulated by negative feedback involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, and thyroid (see Figure 32–1). T4 is the predominant thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. Most circulating T3 and T4 is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), albumin, and prealbu- min. Less than 1% of T3 and T4 exists as free T3 (FT3) and free T4 (FT4). T4 is deiodinated in the tissues to either T3 (active) or reverse T3 (inactive). In peripheral tissues, T3 binds to high-affinity nuclear thyroid hormone receptors in the cyto- plasm and translocates to the nucleus, exerting its biologic effects by modifying gene expression. The T4 level is low in hypothyroidism. It may also be low in premature infants, malnutrition, severe illness, and fol- lowing therapy with T3. It is not clear whether premature infants with low T4 benefit from treatment. T4 is also low in situations that affect TBG. TBG levels are decreased in familial TBG deficiency, nephrosis, and in patients receiving androgens. In sepsis, TBG cleavage is increased. Treatment with certain medications (heparin, furosemide, salicylates, and phenytoin) results in abnormal binding to TBG. How- ever, since these effects involve primarily TBG levels, and not thyroid function per se, TSH and FT4 levels remain in the normal range. T3 and T4 levels are high in hyperthyroidism and may be elevated in conditions associated with increased TBG levels (congenital TBG excess, pregnancy, estrogen therapy) and increased thyroid hormone binding to transport proteins.    CHAPTER 32 926 death. An experienced thyroid surgeon is crucial to good surgical outcome. After thyroidectomy, patients become hypothyroid and need thyroid hormone replacement.  Course & Prognosis Partial remissions and exacerbations may continue for sev- eral years. Treatment with an antithyroid agent results in prolonged remissions in one third to two thirds of children.

Neonatal Graves Disease Transient congenital hyperthyroidism (neonatal Graves dis- ease) occurs in about 1% of infants born to mothers with Graves disease. It occurs when maternal TSH receptor anti- bodies cross the placenta and stimulate excess thyroid hor- mone production in the fetus and newborn. Neonatal Graves disease can be associated with irritability, IUGR, poor weight gain, flushing, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and thrombo- cytopenia. Severe cases may result in cardiac failure and death. Hyperthyroidism may develop several days after birth, especially if the mother was treated with PTU (which crosses the placenta). Symptoms develop as PTU levels decline in the newborn after birth. Thyroid studies should be obtained at birth and repeated within the first week. Immediate manage- ment should focus on the cardiac manifestations. Temporary treatment may be necessary with iodide, antithyroid agents, β-adrenergic antagonists, or corticosteroids. Hyperthyroid- ism gradually resolves over 1–3 months as maternal antibod- ies decline. As TSH receptor antibodies may still be present in the serum of previously hyperthyroid mothers after thy- roidectomy or radioablation, neonatal Graves disease should be considered in all infants of mothers with a history of hyperthyroidism.

Radetti G et al: Fetal and neonatal thyroid disorders. Minerva Pediatr 2002;54:383 [PMID: 12244277]. THYROID CANCER Thyroid cancer is rare in childhood. Children usually present with a thyroid nodule or an asymptomatic asymmetrical neck mass. Dysphagia and hoarseness are unusual but may occur. Thyroid function tests are usually normal. A “cold” nodule is often seen on a technetium or radioiodine uptake scan of the thyroid. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule assists in the diagnosis. The most common thyroid cancer is papillary thyroid carcinoma, a well-differentiated carcinoma arising from the thyroid follicular cell. Children frequently present with local metastases to the cervical lymph nodes and occasionally with pulmonary metastasis. Despite its aggressive presentation, children with papillary thyroid carcinoma have a relatively good prognosis, with a 20-year survival rate greater than 90%. Treatment consists of total thyroidectomy and removal of all involved lymph nodes, usually followed by radioiodine abla- tion to destroy residual thyroid remnant and metastatic tissue left behind after surgery. Thyroid hormone replacement is then started to suppress TSH to prevent stimulation of resid- ual thyroid tissue. Since papillary thyroid carcinoma in chil- dren is associated with a high recurrence rate, regular follow- up with serum thyroglobulin levels (a tumor marker), neck ultrasound, and radioiodine whole body scan are required. Follicular thyroid carcinoma, medullary thyroid carci- noma, anaplastic carcinoma, and lymphoma are less com- mon thyroid malignancies. Medullary thyroid carcinoma, due to autosomal dominant mutations in the RET proto- oncogene, arises from the thyroid C cells, which secrete calcitonin. It can occur sporadically or can be inherited in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. It is associated with elevated serum calcitonin levels. In affected families, all members should be screened for the mutation, and those identified with the mutation should be treated with prophylactic thy- roidectomy in early childhood.

A gregarious and affectionate personality is the rule in children with the syndrome. Hypercalcemia may not appear until several months after birth. Treatment consists of restriction of dietary calcium and vitamin D (Calcilo for- mula) and, in severe cases, moderate doses of glucocorticoids. A defect in the metabolism of, or responsiveness to, vitamin D is postulated as the cause of Williams syndrome. Elastin deletions localized to chromosome 7 have been identified in more than 90% of patients. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization analysis (FISH) may be the best initial diag- nostic tool. The risk of hypercalcemia generally resolves by age 4 years and dietary restrictions can be relaxed. IMMOBILIZATION HYPERCALCEMIA Abrupt immobilization, particularly in a rapidly growing ado- lescent, may cause hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Abnor- malities often appear 1–3 weeks after immobilization. Medical or dietary intervention may be required in severe cases. HYPOPHOSPHATASIA Hypophosphatasia is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by deficiency of alkaline phosphatase activity in serum, bone, and tissues. Enzyme deficiency leads to poor skeletal mineralization with clinical and radiographic features similar to rickets. Six different clinical forms are identified. The perinatal form is characterized by severe skeletal deformity and death within a few days of birth. The infantile form includes failure to thrive, hypotonia, and craniosynostosis. The child- hood form manifests with variable skeletal findings, reduced bone mineral density, and premature loss of deciduous teeth. Serum calcium levels may be elevated. The diagnosis of hypo- phosphatasia is made by demonstrating elevated urinary phos- phoethanolamine associated with low serum alkaline phospha- tase. Therapy is generally supportive. Children who survive the neonatal period may experience gradual improvement. Calci- tonin may be of value for the acute treatment of hypercalcemia.

955,Gonads (Ovaries & Testes),Hematologic Disorders ,2663,"GONADS (OVARIES & TESTES) DEVELOPMENT & PHYSIOLOGY The fetal gonads develop from bipotential anlagen in the genital ridge. The genital ridge contains gonadal tissue, and müllerian and wolffian structures with the potential to dif- ferentiate into components of the internal reproductive structures. Table 32–8 summarizes the male and female structures arising from müllerian and wolffian ducts. The SRY gene region of the Y chromosome, promotes testicular differentiation of the bipotential gonads. WT1 and other transcription factors, such as SF1, DAX1, WNT4, and SOX9, are also important in gonadal differentiation. Once testicular differentiation has been determined, the fetal testis produces two substances critical for male differentiation. Antimülle- rian hormone promotes the regression of müllerian struc- tures, and testosterone stimulates growth of wolffian-based internal structures. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), formed by 1α-reductase action on testosterone, is primarily responsible for virilization of the external genitalia. In the absence of both antimüllerian hormone and testosterone, differentia- tion into female internal and external genitalia occurs. AMBIGUOUS GENITALIA Ambiguous genitalia is the result of incomplete or disor- dered genital or gonadal development that causes a discor- dance between genetic sex, gonadal sex, and phenotypic sex. When an infant is born with ambiguity, immediate consulta- tion with pediatric endocrinology, urology, and if possible psychiatry is required. Disorders of sexual differentiation stem from alterations in three main processes: gonadal differentiation, steroidogenesis, or androgen action. 1. Disorders of Gonadal Differentiation These abnormalities include XY sex reversal, XX sex reversal, XY gonadal dysgenesis, true hermaphroditism, vanishing testes, and Leydig cell hypoplasia. Patients with XY sex reversal usually have pure gonadal dysgenesis. They have completely normal female external genitalia and present as girls with delayed puberty and amenorrhea. XX sex reversal, characterized by masculine or ambiguous genital develop- ment in an XX individual, can be caused by translocation of the SRY gene to the X chromosome. A true hermaphrodite must have both ovarian and testicular tissue and typically has a karyotype of 46,XX. Individuals with XY gonadal dysgene- sis usually have a mosaic karyotype in which some cell lines are 45,XO and others are 46,XY. These individuals may present with normal male phenotype or ambiguity. Dysge- netic gonads have an increased risk for neoplastic transfor- mation. Because of decreased testosterone production in utero, 46,XY individuals with vanishing testes or Leydig cell hypoplasia will have some degree of undervirilization. 2. Disorders of Steroidogenesis These disorders generally present as micropenis, genital ambiguity, or complete absence of male external genitalia in an XY individual (Figure 32–6). Testicular tissue is present and produces antimüllerian hormone. Thus, internal struc-    949 33 Diabetes Mellitus H. Peter Chase, MD George S.

971,General Considerations,Hematologic Disorders ,219,"GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Type 1 diabetes or immune-mediated diabetes (previously called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes melli- tus [IDDM]) is the most common type of diabetes in people younger than age 40 years. It is associated with islet cell antibodies (immunologic markers), diminished insulin pro- duction, and being ketosis-prone. Type 2 diabetes (non–insulin-dependent diabetes melli- tus [NIDDM], non–immune-mediated) is the most com- mon type in persons older than age 40 years; it is associated with being overweight, insensitivity to insulin, and not being prone to ketosis. Type 2 diabetes is increasing in frequency in children and is found in up to half of black and Hispanic children and in over two thirds of American Indian children who develop diabetes. It occurs most frequently in over- weight teenagers. Maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY) is much less common and comprises several forms of diabetes in non- obese children with identified genetic mutations (eg, muta- tions of glucokinase or hepatic nuclear factor 1 or 2 genes). It presents as a nonketotic form of diabetes without islet cell antibodies and often is associated with a family history of diabetes in several generations. Neonatal diabetes, which is rare, is associated with sev- eral distinct etiologies that require specialty evaluation and specific therapies. For example, some children have transient neonatal diabetes. Others have specific mutations and are best treated with sulfonylurea medications after receiving initial insulin therapy.  Pathogenesis A. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes results from immunologic damage to the insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreatic islets. This dam- age occurs gradually—over months or years in most peo- ple—and symptoms do not appear until about 90% of the pancreatic islets have been destroyed. The immunologic damage requires a genetic predisposition and is probably influenced by environmental factors. The importance of genetics is shown by the fact that among identical twins, more then 50% of second twins develop diabetes after the first twin develops the disease. About 6% of siblings or offspring of persons with type 1 diabetes also develop diabetes (compared with prevalence in the general population of 0.2–0.3%). The condition is more common in white children but occurs in all racial groups. There is an association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3 and HLA-DR4, and about 95% of white diabetic children have at least one of these HLA types. Forty percent have both HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4 (one from each parent), compared with only 3% of the general population. The importance of environmental factors is suggested because not all second identical twins develop diabetes. Important environmental factors may be viral infections or factors in the diet. The immunologic basis of diabetes is demonstrated by the ability of cyclosporin, a potent immunosuppressive agent, to preserve islet tissue for 1–2 years when given to newly diag- nosed patients. However, renal damage from cyclosporin pre- cludes its use. White blood cells are found in the islets of newly diagnosed patients and may release toxic products (free radi- cals, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor) that injure the islets. Antibodies to islet cells, insulin, glutamic acid decarbox- ylase, ICA512 (IA-2), and other antigens are present for months to years prior to diagnosis in the serum of over 90% of patients who will develop type 1 diabetes. These antibodies are probably the effect and not the cause of islet β-cell destruction. Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Interven- tion trials on antibody-positive first-degree relatives have begun in an effort to try to prevent type 1 diabetes. B. Type 2 Diabetes The prevention of type 2 diabetes was evaluated in a large study, the Diabetes Prevention Program. The study found that 30 minutes of exercise per day (5 days/wk) and a low-fat diet reduced the risk of diabetes by 58%. Taking metformin also reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 31%.  Clinical Findings The classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss are now so well recognized that friends or family members often suspect the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in affected individuals. Other cases may be detected by finding glucosuria on routine office urinalysis. Up to 50% of new cases of diabetes used to be diagnosed in patients presenting in coma, but most are now diagnosed before the individuals develop severe ketonuria, ketonemia, and secondary acido- sis. Children often have a preceding minor illness, such as a flulike episode. Blood or urine glucose levels can be checked in a few seconds, which could be life-saving. No disease other than diabetes (mellitus or insipidus) presents with continued frequent urination in spite of a dry tongue. An oral glucose tolerance test is rarely necessary in children. A random blood glucose level above 300 mg/dL (16.6 mmol/L) or a fasting blood glucose level above 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) is suffi- cient to make the diagnosis of diabetes. The 1997 revised guidelines for the diagnosis of diabetes (see references) are a fasting plasma glucose level over 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or a plasma glucose level above 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) taken randomly (with symptoms of diabetes) or 2 hours after an oral glucose load (1.75 g glucose/kg up to a maximum of 75 g). Confirmation of such abnormalities on more than one occasion is recommended as transient hyperglycemia can occur, particularly with illness. Impaired (not yet diabetic) fasting glucose values are 100–125 mg/dL (5.5–6.9 mmol/L) and impaired 2-hour values are 140–200 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L). If the presentation is mild, hospitalization is usu- ally not necessary.  Treatment Most children have type 1 diabetes. The five major variables in treatment are (1) insulin type and dosage, (2) diet, (3) exer- cise, (4) stress management, and (5) blood glucose and ketone monitoring. All must be considered to obtain safe and effective metabolic control. Although teenagers can be taught to perform many of the tasks of diabetes manage- ment, they do better when supportive—not overbearing— parents continue to be involved in management of their disease. Children younger than age 10 or 11 years cannot reliably administer insulin without adult supervision because they lack fine motor control and may not understand the importance of accurate dosage. A. Patient and Family Education Education about diabetes for all family members is essential for the home management of diabetes. The use of an educa- tional book (see Understanding Diabetes in the references) can be very helpful to the family. All caregivers need to learn about diabetes, how to give insulin injections, perform home blood glucose monitoring, and handle acute complications. The stress imposed on the family around the time of initial diagno- sis may lead to feelings of shock, denial, sadness, anger, fear, and guilt. Meeting with a counselor to express these feelings at the time of diagnosis helps with long-term adaptation. A. Insulin Insulin has three key functions: (1) it allows glucose to pass into the cell; (2) it decreases the physiologic production of glucose, particularly in the liver; and (3) it turns off ketone production. 1. Treatment of new-onset diabetes—The greater the aci- demia and ketone production, the greater the amount of insulin needed. If ketonemia is significant, venous blood pH is low (< 7.30), and the patient is dehydrated, intravenous insulin and fluid therapy should be given (see later discussion of ketonuria, ketonemia, and ketoacidosis). If the child is adequately hydrated and has a normal venous blood pH, one or two intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of 0.1–0.2 U/kg of regular insulin—or preferably of insulin lispro (Hu- malog, [H]) or insulin aspart (NovoLog, [NL])—1 hour apart will help shut down ketone production. If ketone production is insignificant or absent, this regimen is not necessary, and routine subcutaneous injections can be started. When ketones are not present, the child is usually more responsive to insulin, and a total daily dosage of 0.25–0.5 U/ kg/24 h (by subcutaneous injection) can be used. If ketones are or were present, the child usually does not produce as much insulin and will require 0.5–1 U/kg of total insulin per 24 hours.   CHAPTER 33 950 B.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is now being used in some children and adolescents. Subcutaneous glucose levels are obtained every 1–5 minutes from a sensor placed under the skin. As with insulin pump therapy, additional education, usually at a specialty diabetes center, is required. F. Laboratory Evaluations In addition to home measurements of blood glucose and blood or urine ketone levels, the HbA1c level should be measured every 3 months. This test reflects the frequency of elevated blood glucose levels over the previous 3 months. Normal values vary among laboratories but are usually below 6.2% HbA1c. The desired ranges are based on age. For the HbA1c method, these ranges are as follows: 12–19 years, less than 7.5%; 6–11 years, less than 8.0%; and younger than 5 years, 7.5–8.5%. Higher levels are allowed in younger children to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia because their brains are still developing and they may not relate symptoms of hypoglycemia to a need for treatment. Low HbA1c values are generally associated with a greater risk for hypoglycemia (see the following section). Using either method, longitudi- nal averages more than 33% above the upper limit of normal are associated with a higher risk for later renal and retinal complications. In the intensive treatment group of the DCCT, the lower HbA1c values resulted in greater than 50% reductions in the retinal, renal, cardiovascular, and neuro- logic complications of diabetes. Since atherosclerosis is the major cause of death in older patients with diabetes it is important to measure serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high- density lipoprotein cholesterol levels once yearly. Choles- terol levels should be below 200 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dL in postpuber- tal patients with diabetes. When puberty is reached and the individual has had diabetes for 3 years or longer, the urinary excretion of albu- min should be measured (as microalbumin) in two separate urine samples once yearly (see discussion of chronic compli- cations, later). This can be done using timed overnight urine collections or first-morning voids (expressed per milligram of creatinine). Normal values differ with the methodology of the laboratory but are generally below 20 mcg/min (or 30 mcg/ mg creatinine). People with type 2 diabetes should have this test done soon after diagnosis and then annually. If the thyroid is enlarged (about 20% of patients with type 1 diabetes), the thyroid-stimulating hormone level should be measured yearly. This is usually the first test to become abnormal in the autoimmune thyroiditis commonly associ- ated with type 1 diabetes. In recent years antiendomysial and transglutaminase antibodies, reliable predictors of celiac disease, have been shown to be more common in children with diabetes as well as in their siblings. Risk of celiac disease is associated with HLA-DR3 and is more frequent in children with diabetes (celiac disease occurring in about 5%). The celiac antibodies should be checked in diabetic children with poor growth (especially when not related to poor glucose control) or those who present with gastrointestinal symptoms. The 21- hydroxylase autoantibody, a marker of increased risk of Addison disease, is present in approximately 1.3% of patients with type 1 diabetes, although Addison disease develops in only about one third of these antibody-positive individuals. Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune disease, and the islet antibody tests are negative. An elevated insulin or C- peptide level is also helpful, indicating that insulin produc- tion is normal or elevated. A checklist of the physician’s contributions to good diabetes care is presented in Table 33–3.  "

Thomas, MD Johan L.K. Van Hove, MD, PhD, MBA Disorders in which single gene defects cause clinically signifi- cant blocks in metabolic pathways are called inborn errors of metabolism. For many years after Garrod first described them in 1908, these conditions were considered rare. Because the number of recognized inborn errors has increased, they are now acknowledged to be important causes of disease in children (estimated incidence 1:1500 children). Many of these disorders can now be treated effectively. Even when treatment is not available, correct "
978,Diagnosis,Neoplastic Disease ,602,"diagnosis permits parents to make informed decisions about future offspring. The pathology is almost always due either to accumula- tion of enzyme substrate behind a metabolic block or to deficiency of the reaction product. In some cases, the accu- mulated enzyme substrate is diffusible and has adverse effects on distant organs; in other cases, as in lysosomal storage diseases, the substrate primarily accumulates locally. The clinical manifestations of inborn errors vary widely with both mild and severe forms of virtually every disorder. Many patients do not match the classic phenotype because mutations are not identical in different patients, even though they occur in the same gene. A first treatment strategy is to enhance the reduced enzyme activity. Gene replacement is a long-term goal, but problems of gene delivery to target organs and control of gene action make this an unrealistic option at present. Enzyme replacement therapy using intravenously adminis- tered recombinant enzyme has been developed as an effec- tive strategy in lysosomal storage disorders. Organ trans- plantation (liver or bone marrow) can provide a source of enzyme for some conditions. Pharmacologic doses of a cofactor such as a vitamin can sometimes be effective in restoring enzyme activity. Alternatively, some strategies are designed to cope with the consequences of enzyme defi- ciency. Strategies used to avoid substrate accumulation include restriction of precursor in the diet (eg, low-phenylal- anine diet for phenylketonuria), avoidance of catabolism, inhibition of an enzyme in the synthesis of the precursor (eg, NTBC in tyrosinemia type I), or removal of accumulated substrate pharmacologically (eg, glycine therapy for isova- leric acidemia) or by dialysis. An inadequately produced metabolite can also be supplemented (eg, glucose adminis- tration for glycogen storage disease type I). Inborn errors can manifest at any time, can affect any organ system, and can mimic many common pediatric problems. This chapter focuses on when to consider meta- bolic disorder in the differential diagnosis of common pedi- atric problems. A few of the more important disorders are then discussed in detail. DIAGNOSIS SUSPECTING INBORN ERRORS Inborn errors must be considered in the differential diagno- sis of critically ill newborns, children with seizures, neurode- generation, mental retardation, developmental delay, recur- rent vomiting, Reye-like syndrome, parenchymal liver disease, cardiomyopathy, unexplained metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia. Inborn errors should be suspected when (1) symptoms accompany changes in diet, (2) the child’s development regresses, (3) the child shows specific food preferences or aversions, or (4) the family has a history of parental consanguinity or problems suggestive of inborn error such as retardation or unex- plained deaths in first- and second-degree relatives. Physical findings associated with inborn errors include alopecia or abnormal hair, retinal cherry-red spot or retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts or corneal opacity, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, coarse features, skeletal changes (including gibbus), neurologic regression, and intermittent or progres- sive ataxia or dystonia. Other features that may be important in the context of a suspicious history include failure to thrive, microcephaly, rash, jaundice, hypotonia, and hypertonia. Finding an immediate cause of symptoms does not rule out an underlying inborn error. For example, renal tubular  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

With prompt and vigorous treatment, however, patients can recover completely, even from deep coma. All oral intake should be stopped. Sufficient glucose should be given intravenously to avoid or minimize catabolism in a patient with a known inborn error who is at risk for crisis. Most conditions respond favorably to glucose administra- tion, although a few (eg, primary lactic acidosis due to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency) do not. After exclusion of fatty acid oxidation disorders, immediate institution of intravenous fat emulsions (eg, intralipid) can provide crucial caloric input. Severe or increasing hyperammonemia should be treated pharmacologically or with dialysis, and severe acidosis should be treated with bicarbonate. More specific measures can be instituted when a diagnosis is established. NEWBORN SCREENING Criteria for screening newborns for a disorder include its frequency, its consequences if untreated, the ability of ther- apy to mitigate consequences, the cost of testing, and the cost of treatment. All states in the United States screen newborns for phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism. In most states newborns are screened for galactosemia. Other metabolic disorders for which newborns are frequently screened include maple syrup urine disease, homocystinuria due to cystathionine β-synthase deficiency, and biotinidase defi- ciency. Expanded newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry detects several disorders of amino acid, organic acid, and fatty acid metabolism. Some screening tests measure a metabolite (eg, phenylal- anine) that becomes abnormal with time and exposure to diet. In such instances the disease cannot be detected reliably until intake of the substrate is established. Other tests (eg, for biotinidase deficiency) measure enzyme activity and can be performed at any time. Transfusions may cause false-nega- tive results in this instance, and exposure of the sample to heat may cause false-positive results. Technologic advances have extended the power of newborn screening but have brought additional challenges. For example, although tan- dem mass spectrometry can detect many more disorders in the newborn period, consensus on diagnosis and treatment for some conditions is still under development. Screening tests are not diagnostic, and diagnostic tests must be undertaken when an abnormal screening result is obtained. Further, because false-negative results occur, a normal newborn screening test does not rule out a condition.

Early discharge of neonates causes significant problems in newborn screening, with both false-negative and false-positive results. Nevertheless, all infants should be screened before discharge from the hospital. The appropriate response to an abnormal screening test depends on the condition in question and the predictive value of the test. For example, when screening for galac- tosemia by enzyme assay, complete absence of enzyme activ- ity is highly predictive of classic galactosemia. Failure to treat may rapidly lead to death. In this case, treatment must be initiated immediately while diagnostic studies are pending. In phenylketonuria, however, a diet restricted in phenylala- nine is harmful to the infant whose screening test is a false- positive, while diet therapy produces an excellent outcome in the truly affected infant if treatment is established within the first weeks of life. Therefore, treatment for phenylketonuria should only be instituted when the diagnosis is confirmed. Physicians should combine current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations, state laws and regulations, and consultation with their local metabolic center to arrive at appropriate strategies for each hospital and practice.

DISORDERS OF  CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASES ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Types 0, I, III, VI, and IX manifest with hypoglycemia in infants.  Types II, V, and VII manifest with rhabdomyolysis or muscle weakness. Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose that is stored in liver and muscle. Different enzyme defects affect its biosynthesis and degradation. The hepatic forms of the glycogenoses cause growth failure, hepatomegaly, and severe fasting hypoglycemia. They include glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (type I; von Gierke disease), debrancher enzyme deficiency (type III), hepatic phosphorylase deficiency (type VI), and phosphorylase kinase deficiency (type IX), which normally regulates hepatic phosphorylase activity. There are two forms of glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency: in type Ia, the catalytic glucose-6-phosphatase is deficient, and in type Ib, the glucose-6-phosphate transporter is deficient. The latter form also has neutropenia. Glycogenosis type IV, brancher enzyme deficiency, usually presents with progres- sive liver cirrhosis. The myopathic forms of glycogenosis affect skeletal mus- cle. Skeletal myopathy with weakness or rhabdomyolysis may be seen in muscle phosphorylase deficiency (type V), phosphofructokinase deficiency (type VII), and acid maltase deficiency (type II; Pompe disease). The infantile form of Pompe disease also has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and macroglossia. The gluconeogenetic disorder fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase deficiency presents with major lactic acidosis and delayed hypoglycemia on fasting.  Diagnosis Initial tests include glucose, lactate, triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, transaminases, and creatine kinase.

Patient and parent support group web site with useful information for families: http://www.galactosemia.org HEREDITARY FRUCTOSE INTOLERANCE Hereditary fructose intolerance is an autosomal recessive disorder in which deficient activity of fructose-1-phosphate aldolase causes hypoglycemia and tissue accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate on fructose ingestion. Other abnor- malities include failure to thrive, vomiting, jaundice, hepato- megaly, proteinuria, and generalized aminoaciduria. The untreated condition can progress to death from liver failure.  Diagnosis The diagnosis is suggested by finding fructosuria or an abnormal transferrin glycoform in the untreated patient. The appearance of hypoglycemia and hypophosphatemia after a closely monitored intravenous fructose loading test (200 mg/kg) is diagnostic. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding reduced enzyme activity of fructose-1-phosphate aldolase in the liver. Some patients may be diagnosed by identification of one of the common mutations on DNA analysis, but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis.  Treatment Treatment consists of strict dietary avoidance of fructose. Vitamin supplementation is usually needed. Management is complicated by the fact that many drugs and vitamins are dispensed in a sucrose base. Treatment monitoring can be done with transferrin glycoform analysis. If diet compliance is poor, physical growth retardation may occur. Growth will resume when more stringent dietary restrictions are reinsti- tuted. If the disorder is recognized early, the prospects for normal development are good. As affected individuals grow up, they may recognize the association of nausea and vomit- ing with ingestion of fructose-containing foods and selec- tively avoid them.

985,Disorders of Energy Metabolism,Neoplastic Disease ,3065,"DISORDERS OF ENERGY METABOLISM The most common disorders of central mitochondrial energy metabolism are pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and deficiencies of respiratory chain components. Disorders of the Krebs cycle include deficiencies in fumarase, 2-keto- glutarate dehydrogenase, and succinyl-CoA ligase. In many, but not all patients, lactate is elevated in either blood or CSF. In pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, the lactate:pyruvate ratio is normal, whereas in respiratory chain disorders, the ratio is increased. Care must be taken to distinguish an elevated lactate level that is due to these conditions (called primary lactic acidoses) from elevated lactate that is a conse- quence of hypoxia, ischemia, or sampling problems. Table 34–3 lists some causes of primary lactic acidosis. Patients with a defect in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex often have agenesis of the corpus callosum or Leigh syndrome (lesions in the globus pallidus, dentate nucleus, and periaqueductal gray matter). They can have mild facial Table 34–3. Causes of primary  lactic acidosis in childhood.

Patient and parent support group web site with useful information for families: http://www.umdf.org DISORDERS OF AMINO ACID METABOLISM DISORDERS OF THE UREA CYCLE Ammonia is mostly derived from the catabolism of amino acids and is converted to an amino group in urea by enzymes of the urea cycle. Patients with severe defects (often those enzymes early in the urea cycle) usually present in infancy with severe hyperammonemia, vomiting, and encephalopa- thy, which is rapidly fatal. In patients with milder genetic defects, the course may be milder with vomiting and enceph- alopathy after protein ingestion or infection. Although defects in argininosuccinic acid synthetase (citrullinemia) and argini- nosuccinic acid lyase (argininosuccinic acidemia) may cause severe hyperammonemia in infancy, the usual clinical course is chronic with mental retardation. Ornithine transcarbamy- lase deficiency is X-linked. The rest of the urea cycle disorders are autosomal recessive. Age at onset of symptoms varies with residual enzyme activity, protein intake, growth, and stresses such as infection. Even within a family, males with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may differ by decades in the age of symptom onset. Many female carriers of ornithine trans- carbamylase deficiency have protein intolerance. Some develop migraine-like symptoms after protein loads, and others develop potentially fatal episodes of vomiting and encephalopathy after protein ingestion, infections, or during labor and delivery. Trichorrhexis nodosa is common in patients with the chronic form of argininosuccinic acidemia.  Diagnosis Blood ammonia should be measured in any acutely ill newborn in whom a cause is not obvious. In urea cycle defects, early hyperammonemia is associated with respira- tory alkalosis. Serum citrulline is low or undetectable in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcar- bamylase deficiency, high in argininosuccinic acidemia, and very high in citrullinemia. Large amounts of arginino- succinic acid are found in the urine of patients with argininosuccinic acidemia. Urine orotic acid is increased in infants with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Cit- rullinemia and argininosuccinic acidemia can be diag- nosed in utero by appropriate enzyme assays, but carbam- oyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency can be diagnosed in utero only by molecular methods.  Treatment During treatment of acute hyperammonemic crisis, protein intake should be stopped, and glucose and lipids should be given to reduce endogenous protein breakdown from catab- olism. Arginine should be given intravenously, both because it is an essential amino acid for patients with urea cycle defects and because it increases the excretion of waste nitro- gen in patients with citrullinemia and argininosuccinic acide- mia. Sodium benzoate, either alone or with sodium phenylace- tate, can be given intravenously to treat hyperammonemic coma. Additionally, hemodialysis or hemofiltration is indi- cated for severe or persistent hyperammonemia, as is usually the case in the newborn. Peritoneal dialysis and double- volume exchange transfusion are insufficiently effective in this setting. Long-term treatment includes oral administration of arginine (or citrulline), adherence to a low-protein diet, and administration of sodium benzoate and sodium phenylbu- tyrate (a prodrug of sodium phenylacetate), to increase excretion of nitrogen as hippuric acid and phenylacetyl- glutamine. Symptomatic heterozygous female carriers of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency should also receive such treatment. Liver transplantation may be curative and is indicated for patients with severe disorders. The outcome of urea cycle disorders depends on the genetic severity of the condition (residual activity) and the severity and prompt treatment of hyperammonemic epi- sodes. Many patients with urea cycle defects, no matter what the enzyme defect, develop permanent neurologic and intel- lectual impairments, with cortical atrophy and ventricular dilation seen on computed tomographic scan. Rapid identi- fication and treatment of the initial hyperammonemic epi- sode improves outcome. Bachmann C: Outcome and survival of 88 patients with urea cycle disorders: A retrospective evaluation.

Organic acidemias are disorders of amino and fatty acid metabolism in which nonamino organic acids accumulate in serum and urine. These conditions are usually diagnosed by examining organic acids in urine, a complex procedure that requires considerable interpretive expertise and is usually performed only in specialized laboratories. Table 34–4 lists the clinical features of organic acidemias, together with the urine organic acid patterns typical of each. Additional details about some of the more important organic acidemias are provided in the sections that follow. PROPIONIC & METHYLMALONIC  ACIDEMIA (KETOTIC HYPERGLYCINEMIAS) Idiopathic hyperglycinemia was first reported in 1961 as a syndrome of mental retardation and episodic ketoacidosis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis, and hypergly- cinemia induced by protein intake or infection. It was then renamed ketotic hyperglycinemia to distinguish it from non- ketotic hyperglycinemia, described in the preceding section. It is now known that the syndrome is almost always due to propionic or methylmalonic acidemia. The oxidation of threonine, valine, methionine, and isoleucine results in propionyl-CoA, which propionyl-CoA carboxylase converts into L-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is metabolized through methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to succi- nyl-CoA. Gut bacteria and the breakdown of odd-chain- length fatty acids also substantially contribute to propionyl- CoA production. Propionic acidemia is due to a defect in the biotin-containing enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and methylmalonic acidemia is due to a defect in methylmalo- nyl-CoA mutase. In most cases the latter is due to a defect in the mutase apoenzyme, but in others it is due to a defect in the biosynthesis of its adenosyl-B12 coenzyme. In some of these defects, only the synthesis of adenosyl-B12 is blocked; in others, the synthesis of methyl-B12 is also blocked. Clinical symptoms in propionic and methylmalonic aci- demia vary according to the location and severity of the enzyme block. Children with severe blocks present with acute, life-threatening metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and bone marrow depression early in infancy or with meta- bolic acidosis, vomiting, and failure to thrive during the first few months of life. Most patients with severe disease have mild or moderate mental retardation. Late complications include pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy, and basal ganglia stroke, and in methylmalonic aciduria, interstitial nephritis. All known forms of propionic and methylmalonic acide- mia are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits and can be diagnosed in utero.  Diagnosis Laboratory findings consist of increases in urinary organic acids derived from propionyl-CoA or methylmalonic acid (see Table 34–4). Hyperglycinemia can be present. In some forms of abnormal B12 metabolism homocysteine can be elevated.  Treatment Patients with enzyme blocks in B12 metabolism usually respond to massive doses of vitamin B12 given intramuscularly. Vitamin B12 nonresponsive methylmalonic acidemia and pro- pionic acidemia require amino acid restriction, strict preven- tion of catabolism, and carnitine supplementation to enhance propionylcarnitine excretion. Intermittent metronidazole can help reduce the propionate load from the gut. In the acute setting, hemodialysis or hemofiltration may be needed. Com- bined liver-renal transplantation is an option for patients with renal insufficiency, and liver transplantation has shown prom- ise for patients with life-threatening cardiomyopathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is highly suggestive. The diagnosis is supported by finding glutaric, 3-hydroxy- glutaric acid, and glutarylcarnitine in urine or serum. Dem- onstration of deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase in fibroblasts, leukocytes, or a mutation in the GCDH gene confirms the diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is by enzyme assay, quantitative metabolite analysis in amniotic fluid, or mutation analysis.  Treatment Aggressive management of catabolism during intercurrent illness and supplementation with large amounts of carnitine may prevent degeneration of the basal ganglia. Dietary lysine and tryptophan are frequently restricted in young patients. Neurologic symptoms, once present, do not resolve. Symp- tomatic treatment of severe dystonia is important for affected patients. Funk CB et al: Neuropathological, biochemical and molecular findings in a glutaric acidemia type 1 cohort.

995,Disorders of Fatty Acid Odation & Carnitine,Neoplastic Disease ,2009,"DISORDERS OF FATTY ACID  OXIDATION & CARNITINE FATTY ACID OXIDATION DISORDERS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Obtain an acylcarnitine profile for any child with hypogly- cemia to evaluate for a fatty acid oxidation defect.  Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent cardiomy- opathy in affected children. Deficiencies of very-long-chain and medium-chain acyl- CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD, MCAD) and long-chain 3- hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), three enzymes of fatty acid β-oxidation, usually cause Reye-like episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia, mild hyperammonemia, hepato- megaly, and encephalopathy. Sudden death in infancy is a less common presentation. The long-chain defects, which also include carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency I and II and carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, often also cause skeletal myopathy with hypotonia and cardiomyopa- thy, and ventricular arrhythmias. Less severe defects present with recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis. LCHAD defi- ciency may produce progressive liver cirrhosis, peripheral neuropathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. Mothers of affected infants can have acute fatty liver of pregnancy or HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low plate- lets). Mild carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency may cause renal tubular acidosis and hypertriglyceridemia. MCAD deficiency is common, occurring in perhaps 1:9000 live births. Reye-like episodes may be fatal or cause residual neurologic damage. Episodes tend to become less frequent and severe with time. After the diagnosis is made and treatment instituted, morbidity decreases and mortality is avoided in MCAD deficiency. Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency is characterized by the presence of ethylmalonic acid in the urine, and although some patients have symptoms similar to those in MCAD deficiency, many are asymptomatic. Glu- taric acidemia type II results from defects in the transfer of electrons from fatty acid oxidation and some amino acid oxidation into the respiratory chain. Some patients with glutaric acidemia type II have a clinical presentation resem- bling MCAD deficiency. Patients with a severe neonatal presentation also have renal cystic disease and dysmorphic features. The least affected patients can present with late- onset myopathy and be riboflavin responsive. Some develop cardiomyopathy or leukodystrophy. These conditions are autosomal recessive.  Diagnosis The hypoglycemic presentation of the Reye episode is associ- ated with a lack of an appropriate ketone response to fasting. Patients with MCAD deficiency may excrete hexanoylgly- cine, suberylglycine, and phenylpropionylglycine in the urine organic acids. Urine and blood findings in glutaric acidemia type II and SCAD deficiency are often diagnostic. The finding of normal urine organic acids does not exclude these conditions, because excretion of dicarboxylic acids and other products of microsomal and peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids can be intermittent. The analysis of acylcarnitine esters is currently the first- line diagnostic test and shows diagnostic metabolites regard- less of clinical status. MCAD deficiency is characterized by elevated octanoylcarnitine. A similar typical pattern can be recognized in deficiencies of VLCAD, LCHAD, carnitine    INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM 975 "
997,Purine Metabolism Disorders,Neoplastic Disease ,34,"PURINE METABOLISM DISORDERS  Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is an enzyme that converts the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine to inosine monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate, respectively. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltrans- ferase deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) is an X-linked recessive disorder. The complete deficiency is characterized by central nervous system dysfunction and purine overpro- duction with hyperuricemia and hyperuricuria. Depending on the residual activity of the mutant enzyme, male hem- izygous individuals may be severely disabled by choreo- athetosis, spasticity, and compulsive, mutilating lip and finger biting, or they may have only gouty arthritis and urate ureterolithiasis. Enzyme deficiency can be measured in erythrocytes, fibroblasts, and cultured amniotic cells; this disorder can thus be diagnosed in utero. Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency involves a defect in the synthesis of purines. Patients present with static mental retardation, hypotonia, and seizures.  Diagnosis Diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is made by demon- strating an elevated uric acid:creatinine ratio in urine, fol- lowed by demonstration of enzyme deficiency in red blood cells or fibroblasts. Screening for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is by measurement of succinylpurines using the Bratton-Marshal colorimetric test, with confirmation by further metabolite and molecular assays.  Treatment Hyperhydration and alkalinization are essential to prevent kidney stones and urate nephropathy. Allopurinol and probenecid may be given to reduce hyperuricemia and prevent gout but do not affect the neurologic status. Physical restraints are often more effective than neurologic medica- tions for automutilation. No effective treatment exists for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.

Defi- ciency of a lysosomal enzyme causes its substrate to accumu- late in the lysosomes of tissues that degrade it, resulting in a characteristic clinical picture. These storage disorders are classified as mucopolysaccharidoses, lipidoses, or mucolipi- doses, depending on the nature of the stored material. Two additional disorders, cystinosis and Salla disease, are caused by defects in lysosomal proteins that normally transport material from the lysosome to the cytoplasm. Table 34–5 lists clinical and laboratory features of these conditions. Most are inherited as autosomal recessive traits, and all can be diag- nosed in utero.  Diagnosis The diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis is suggested by certain clinical and radiologic findings (dysostosis multi- plex). Urine screening tests can detect increased muco- polysaccharides and further identify which specific muco- polysaccharides are present. Diagnosis must be confirmed by enzyme assays of leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts. Analysis of urinary oligosaccharides indicates a specific disorder prior to enzymatic testing. Lipidoses present with visceral symp- toms or neurodegeneration. The pattern of the leukodystro- phy associated with many lipidoses can indicate a specific condition. Diagnosis is made by appropriate enzyme assays of peripheral leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts. Molec- ular analysis is also available for most conditions.  Treatment Most conditions cannot be treated effectively, but new ave- nues have given hope in many conditions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can greatly improve the course of some lysosomal diseases and is first-line treatment in some, such as infantile Hurler syndrome.

Among the enzyme systems in peroxisomes is one for β-oxidation of unusual very-long-chain fatty acids, phy- tanic acid, and bile acids, and one for plasmalogen biosyn- thesis. In addition, peroxisomes contain oxidases for D- and L-amino acids, pipecolic acid, and phytanic acid, and an enzyme (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase) that effects transamination of glyoxylate to glycine. In some peroxisomal diseases, many enzymes are defi- cient. Zellweger (cerebrohepatorenal) syndrome, the best known among these, is caused by several defects in organelle assembly. Patients present in infancy with seizures, hypoto- nia, characteristic facies with a large forehead, and chole- static hepatopathy. At autopsy renal cysts and absent perox- isomes are seen. Patients with a similar but milder biochemical and clinical phenotype have neonatal adreno- leukodystrophy or neonatal Refsum disease. They often have detectable peroxisomes. In other peroxisomal diseases, only a single enzyme is deficient. Primary hyperoxaluria (alanine-glyoxylate amino- transferase deficiency) causes renal stones and nephropathy. Mutations in the X-linked very-long-chain fatty acid trans- porter gene, ABCD1, cause either a rapid leukodystrophy with loss of function (adrenoleukodystrophy), slow progres- sive spasticity and neuropathy (adrenomyeloneuropathy), or adrenal insufficiency. Defective phytanic acid oxidation in adult Refsum disease causes ataxia, leukodystrophy, cardio- myopathy, neuropathy, and cataracts. Other isolated enzyme deficiencies can mimic Zellweger syndrome. Abnormalities of plasmalogen synthesis are clinically asso- ciated with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata. Except for adrenoleukodystrophy, all peroxisomal diseases are autoso- mal recessive and can be diagnosed in utero.  Diagnosis The best screening test for Zellweger syndrome and other biogenesis disorders is determination of very-long-chain fatty acids in serum or plasma. Urine bile acids are abnormal in other peroxisomal disorders. Phytanic acid and plasmalo- gens can also be measured. Together, these studies identify most peroxisomal diseases. Tissue biopsy and appropriate enzyme assays are needed for confirmation, especially when the parents plan further pregnancies.  Treatment Bone marrow transplantation may be an effective treatment at the early stages of adrenoleukodystrophy. Lorenzo’s oil, in combination with a very-low-fat diet and essential fatty acid supplementation, is ineffective in patients with established symptoms, but shows promise in prevention of neurologic symptoms in presymptomatic males with adrenoleukodys- trophy. Dietary treatment is used for adult Refsum disease. Liver transplantation protects the kidneys in severe primary hyperoxaluria.

More than a dozen other forms are characterized by addi- tional key symptoms, including coloboma, cutis laxa, severe epilepsy, ichthyosis, and Dandy-Walker malformation. Bio- chemical differences and variations in clinical course (eg, the absence of peripheral neuropathy) characterize the other types. Pathophysiology probably relates to defects of those biochemical pathways that require glycosylated proteins. The syndromes appear so far to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and frequency was initially estimated to be as high as 1:20,000 in northern Europe.  Diagnosis Diagnosis is supported by finding altered levels of glycosy- lated enzymes or other proteins such as transferrin, thyrox- ine-binding globulin, lysosomal enzymes, and clotting fac- tors (IX, XI, antithrombin III, and proteins C and S). However, these levels may be normal in carbohydrate- deficient glycoprotein syndromes or abnormal in other conditions. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding typical pat- terns of altered isoelectric focusing of selected proteins. Most diagnostic laboratories examine serum transferrin to screen for N-linked defects and apoC1 for O-linked defects. Follow-up diagnosis is by assaying enzyme activity, analysis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in fibroblasts, and mutation analysis.  Treatment Treatment is supportive, with opportunity to monitor and provide early treatment for expected clinical features.

1001,Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome  & Disorders of Cholesterol Synthesis,Neoplastic Disease ,2053,"SMITH-LEMLI-OPITZ SYNDROME &  DISORDERS OF CHOLESTEROL SYNTHESIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Two- or three-toe syndactyly, facial dysmorphism, cardiac and genitourinary anomalies.  Developmental delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, and poor growth in neonates with Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome.  Symptoms range from mild to life threatening.  Elevated 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol in serum and other tissue is diagnostic in SLO syndrome; serum cho- lesterol is usually low, but may be within normal range. Several defects of cholesterol synthesis are associated with malformations and neurodevelopmental disability. Smith- Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome is an autosomal recessive dis- order caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholes- terol δ7-reductase. It is characterized by microcephaly, poor growth, mental retardation, typical dysmorphic features of face and extremities (particularly two- to three-toe syndac- tyly), and often malformations of the heart and genitouri- nary system. Severity ranges from moderate to severe mental retardation to early death. Although deficient synthesis of cholesterol leads directly to deficiency of some hormones and bile acids, the pathophysiology of the malformations is unclear. Frequency is estimated to be between 1:40,000 and 1:20,000. Other cholesterol synthetic defects are seen in Conradi Hünnermann syndrome with chondrodysplasia punctata and atrophic skin. Cholestanolosis (cerebrotendi- nous xanthomatosis) manifests with progressive ataxia and cataracts.  Diagnosis In SLO, elevated 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol in serum or other tissues, including amniotic fluid, is diagnostic. Serum cholesterol levels may be low or in the normal range. Enzymes of cholesterol synthesis may be assayed in cultured fibroblasts or amniocytes, and mutation analysis is possible.  Treatment Although postnatal treatment does not resolve prenatal injury, supplementation with cholesterol in SLO improves growth and behavior. The role of supplemental bile acids is controver- sial. Simvastatin reduces 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol and increases cholesterol levels by induction of its synthetic enzymes, but its effect on clinical symptoms is unclear.

1002,Disorders of Neurotransmitter Metabolism,Neoplastic Disease ,17,"DISORDERS OF  NEUROTRANSMITTER METABOLISM ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Movement disorder, especially dystonia and oculogyric crises.  Severe seizures, abnormal tone, ataxia, and mental retardation occur in severely affected infants.  Mildly affected patients have dopa-responsive dysto- nia with diurnal variability.  Deficient serine synthesis causes microcephaly, sei- zures and failure of myelination in neonates. Abnormalities of neurotransmitter metabolism are increas- ingly recognized as causes of significant neurodevelopmental disabilities. Affected patients may present with movement disorders (especially dystonia and oculogyric crises), sei- zures, abnormal tone, ataxia, or mental retardation. Patients may be mildly affected (eg, dopa-responsive dystonia with diurnal variation) or severely affected (eg, intractable sei- zures with profound mental retardation). Deficient serine synthesis leads to congenital microcephaly, infantile seizures, and failure of myelination. Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy manifests as a severe seizure disorder in the neonatal or early infantile period that responds to high doses of pyridoxine. The disorder is caused by deficient activity of the enzyme α-amino adipic semialdehyde dehydro- genase resulting from mutations in the antiquitin (ALDH7A1) gene. Pyridoxal-phosphate–responsive encephalopathy mani- fests as a severe seizure disorder in infancy that responds to pyridoxal-phosphate. This disorder is caused by mutations in the PNPO gene encoding pyridox(am)ine oxidase, which is necessary for activation of pyridoxine.  Diagnosis Although some disorders can be diagnosed by examining serum amino acids or urine organic acids (eg, 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria), in most cases, diagnosis requires analysis of CSF. Spinal fluid samples for neurotransmitter analysis require spe- cial collection and handling, as the neurotransmitter levels are graduated along the axis of the central nervous system and are highly unstable once the sample is collected. A phenylalanine loading test can be diagnostic for mild defects in GTP-cyclohy- drolase deficiency, in which neurotransmitter analysis may be insufficiently sensitive. Analysis of CSF amino acids shows elevated threonine in pyridoxal-phosphate–responsive disease and decreased serine and glycine in serine biosynthetic defects.  Treatment For some conditions, such as pyridoxine-responsive seizures, pyridoxal-phosphate–responsive encephalopathy, or dopa- responsive dystonia, response to treatment can be dramatic. For others, response to therapy is less satisfactory in part because of poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Supplementation with serine and glycine can substantially improve outcome in serine deficiency. Abeling NG et al: Sepiapterin reductase deficiency an autoso- mal recessive DOPA-responsive dystonia.

Three dis- orders of creatine synthesis are now known: arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, and creatine trans- porter (CrT1) deficiency. GAMT and AGAT deficiencies are autosomal recessive disorders, whereas CrT1 deficiency is X- linked.

Manchester, MD Genetics is an exciting and rapidly evolving field that has significant relevance to the understanding of human embry- ology, physiology, and disease processes. Tremendous advances in molecular biology and biochemistry are allowing more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms inher- ent in genetic disorders, as well as improved diagnostic tests and management options. Many of the newer technologies and terms may be unfamiliar to the clinician in practice. Thus, the topics in the first part of the chapter serve as an introduction and review of the basic principles of genetics, including basic knowledge of cytogenetics and molecular biology. The principles of inherited human disorders are reviewed, encompassing different causes of genetic disor- ders, with a discussion of dysmorphology and teratology. The topics in the second part of the chapter focus on common clinical disorders including descriptions of the diseases, with a discussion of their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. "
1004,Foundations of Genetic Diagnosis,Pain Management & Palliative Care ,1106,"FOUNDATIONS OF GENETIC DIAGNOSIS CYTOGENETICS Cytogenetics is the study of genetics at the chromosome level. Chromosomal anomalies occur in 0.4% of all live births and are a common cause of mental retardation and congenital anomalies. The prevalence of chromosomal anomalies is much higher among spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Chromosomes Human chromosomes consist of DNA (the blueprint of genetic material), specific proteins forming the backbone of the chromosome (called histones), and other chromatin structural and interactive proteins. Chromosomes contain most of the genetic information necessary for growth and differentiation. The nuclei of all normal human cells, with the exception of gametes, contain 46 chromosomes, consisting of 23 pairs (Figure 35–1). Of these, 22 pairs are called autosomes. They are numbered according to their size; chromosome 1 is the largest and chromosome 22 the smallest. In addition, there are two sex chromosomes: two X chromosomes in females and one X and one Y chromosome in males. The two members of a chromosome pair are called homologous chro- mosomes. One homolog of each chromosome pair is mater- nal in origin (from the egg); the second is paternal (from the sperm). The egg and sperm each contain 23 chromosomes (haploid cells). During formation of the zygote, they fuse into a cell with 46 chromosomes (diploid cell). Cell Division Cells undergo cycles of growth and division that are con- trolled according to their needs and functions. Mitosis is a kind of cell division, occurring in stages, during which DNA replication takes place and two daughter cells, genetically identical to the original parent cells, are formed. This cell division is typical for all somatic cells (cells other than the sperm or egg, which are called germline cells). There are four phases of mitosis: interphase, prophase, metaphase, and anaphase (Figure 35–2). In interphase, chro- mosomes are long, thin, and nonvisible. At this time, the genetic material is replicated. In prophase, the chromosomes are more condensed. During metaphase (the phase following DNA replication but preceding cell division), individual chromosomes can be visualized. Each arm consists of two identical parts, called chromatids. Chromatids of the same chromosome are called sister chromatids. In anaphase, the genetic material is separated into two cells. Meiosis (Figure 35–3), during which eggs and sperm are formed, is cell division limited to gametes. During meiosis, three unique processes take place: 1. Crossing over of genetic material between two homolo- gous chromosomes. This is preceded by the pairing of both members of each chromosome pair, which facilitates the physical exchange of homologous genetic material.  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Some disorders that may be diagnosed via direct DNA mutational analysis include Du- chenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, some forms of cra- niosynostosis, cystic fibrosis, and fragile X syndrome. Indirect detection of abnormal genes is used when the gene is known but there is extensive heterogeneity of the molecular defect between families, or when the gene respon- sible for a disease is unknown but its chromosome location is known. One form of indirect analysis is the linkage method. Linkage traces the inheritance of the abnormal gene between members in a kindred. This method requires that the af- fected individual be studied, as well as parents and other relatives, both affected and unaffected. Linkage analysis, is performed by using markers such as a restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Another method uses flanking mi- crosatellite polymorphisms. An increase in density of poly- morphisms discovered over the past few years allows the presence or absence of an abnormal copy of a gene in an individual to be predicted with a high degree of confidence, if the relatives have informative polymorphisms. Microsatel- lite polymorphisms are being used in sibling research studies to identify the multiple genes that contribute to polygenic traits such as diabetes and obesity. They are also used increasingly to identify gene changes in tumors. Neurofibromatosis is an example of a disorder in which both the direct and indirect assay may be used. An estimated 90–95% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 have a mutation or deletion that can be identified using a direct assay of the neurofibromin gene (NF1). The other cases must rely on indirect methods such as linkage analysis for prenatal diagnosis. Molecular Biology in Prevention  & Treatment of Human Diseases Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to prevent genetic disease by facilitating the detection of carriers of defective genes and permitting prenatal diagnosis. Family studies can also clarify the mode of inheritance, thus allow- ing more accurate determination of recurrence risks and appropriate options. For example, differentiation of gonadal mosaicism from decreased penetrance of a dominant gene has important implications for genetic counseling. In the past, the diagnosis of a genetic disease characterized by late onset of symptoms (eg, Huntington disease) could not be made prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms. In some inborn errors of metabolism, diagnostic tests (eg, measure- ment of enzyme activities) could be conducted only on inaccessible tissues. Gene identification (mutation analysis) techniques can enormously enhance the ability to diagnose both symptomatic and presymptomatic individuals, hetero- zygous carriers of gene mutations, and affected fetuses. However, presymptomatic DNA testing is associated with psychological, ethical, and legal implications and therefore should be used only with informed consent. Formal genetic counseling is indicated to best interpret the results of molec- ular testing. A normal gene introduced into an individual affected with a serious inherited disorder during embryonic life (germline therapy) in principle has the potential to be trans- mitted to future generations, whereas its introduction into somatic cells (somatic therapy) affects only the recipient. Experimental gene therapy by bone marrow transplantation is being tried for adenosine deaminase deficiency. Recombi- nant enzyme replacement has been successfully applied in treating the non-neurologic form of Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidosis types I and II, and some types of lysosomal storage disease.

1011,Principles of Inherited Human Disorders,Pain Management & Palliative Care ,3850,"PRINCIPLES OF INHERITED  HUMAN DISORDERS MENDELIAN INHERITANCE Traditionally, autosomal single gene disorders follow the principles explained by Mendel’s observations. To summa- rize, the inheritance of genetic traits through generations relies on segregation and independent assortment. Segrega- tion is the process through which gene pairs are separated during gamete formation. Each gamete receives only one copy of each gene (allele). Independent assortment refers to the idea that the segregation of different alleles occurs independently. Victor McKusick’s catalog, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, lists more than 10,000 entries in which the mode of inheritance is presumed to be autosomal dominant, autoso- mal recessive, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive, and Y- linked. Single genes at specific loci on one or a pair of chromosomes cause these disorders. An understanding of inheritance terminology is helpful in approaching mendelian disorders. Analysis of the pedigree and the pattern of trans- mission in the family, identification of a specific condition, and knowledge of that condition’s mode of inheritance usually allow for explanation of the inheritance pattern. Terminology The following terms are important in understanding hered- ity patterns. 1. Dominant and recessive—As defined by Mendel, con- cepts for dominant and recessive refer to the phenotypic expres- sion of alleles and are not intrinsic characteristics of gene loci. Therefore, it is inappropriate to discuss “a dominant locus.” 2. Genotype—Genotype means the genetic status, that is, the alleles an individual carries.    CHAPTER 35 996 5. Somatic cells show an increase in mtDNA mutations and a decline in oxidative phosphorylation function with age. This explains the later onset of some of these disorders and may indeed be a clue to the whole aging process.

FAMILY HISTORY & PEDIGREE The first step in the collection of information regarding the genetics of a syndromic diagnosis is the construction of a family tree or pedigree. Underused by most medical person- nel, the pedigree is a valuable record of genetic and medical information, which is much more useful in visual form than in list form. Tips for pedigree preparation include the following: • Start with the proband—the patient’s siblings and par- ents, and obtain a three-generational history if possible. • Always ask about consanguinity. • Obtain data from both sides of the family. • Ask about spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, infertility, chil- dren relinquished for adoption, and deceased individuals. In the course of taking the family history, one may find information that is not relevant in elucidating the cause of the patients’ problem but may indicate a risk for other important health concerns. Such information should be appropriately followed and addressed. Such conditions that may arise are an overwhelming family history of early-onset breast and ovarian cancer, or multiple pregnancy losses necessitating chromosome analyses. "
1018,Dysmorphology & Human Embryology,Pain Management & Palliative Care ,1556,"Dysmorphology & Human Embryology Birth defects are the leading cause of death in the first year of life. They are evident in 2–3% of newborn infants and in up to 7% of adults. Many are now detected by ultrasound prior to birth. Clinical investigation of the causes and conse- quences of birth defects is called dysmorphology. MECHANISMS Developmental Genetics Most birth defects are multifactorial: They result from imbal- ances between genetic processes regulating development and the environments in which they unfold. Specific causes of maldevelopment can be identified in about 35% of cases, but advances in developmental biology and human genetics promise better understanding. So far, single gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities account for at least 25% of birth defects, with the numbers of specific genes and chromo- some loci now being associated with recurring phenotypes, or syndromes, rapidly increasing. Genes for the fundamental processes regulating cell divi- sion, or proliferation, and those that program cell death, or apoptosis, are now being described. Both cellular proliferation and apoptosis are very active in embryogenesis and the bal- ance between these processes is easily disrupted. Imbalances in the regulation of cell cycles are an important determinant of birth defects and may contribute to such commonly occurring problems as neural tube defects, branchial arch anomalies, limb reductions, and congenital heart disease. Morphogenic processes and the genes that regulate them have been highly conserved through evolution. Thus, experi- ments in lower organisms such as Drosophila (fruit flies) can identify candidate genes for human birth defects. For example, mutations in pax genes, which are involved in eye development inDrosophilaproduce “small eye” in mice, and aniridia and other abnormalities of the anterior chamber of the eyes of humans. Embryology and developmental biology have recently and rapidly moved from descriptive to experimental disciplines that use tools such as in situ hybridization to visualize the expression of genes in embryos, and transgenic animals in which develop- mentally active genes are “knocked out” to determine the contributions of specific genes to organ development. These investigations have uncovered, for example, important regula- tory interactions such as the hedgehog signaling pathway, which affects morphogenesis in organs as diverse as limbs, the heart, and the CNS. Human mutations in one evolutionarily con- served gene, sonic hedgehog (SHH), can result in holoprosen- cephaly, a severe birth defect in which the CNS fails to complete its normal hemispheric division. Cellular Interactions The picture emerging from experimental studies of morpho- genesis is one of a hierarchy of gene expression during develop- ment. Morphogenesis begins with expression of genes encoding transcription factors. These proteins bind to DNA in undiffer- entiated embryonic cells and recruit them into developmental fields, groups of cells primed to respond to specific signals later in development. This recruitment also establishes spatial rela- tionships and orients cells with respect to their neighbors. As ▲ Figure 35–9. Mitochondrial inheritance.

Developing kidneys exposed to increased internal pressures for long periods eventually become nonfunctional. CLINICAL DYSMORPHOLOGY Terminology Classification of dysmorphic features strives to reflect mecha- nisms of maldevelopment. However, much of the terminology that describes abnormal development in humans remains histor- ical and documents recognition of patterns prior to understand- ing of their biology. For example, birth defects are referred to as malformations when they result from altered genetic or develop- mental processes. When physical forces interrupt or distort mor- phogenesis, their effects are termed disruptions and deforma- tions, respectively. The term dysplasia is used to denote abnormal histogenesis. Malformations occurring together more frequently than would be expected by chance alone may be classified as belonging to associations. Those in which the order of maldevelopment is understood may be referred to as sequences. For example, Robin sequence (or Pierre Robin anomalad) is used to describe cleft palate that has occurred because poor growth of the jaw (retrognathia) has displaced the tongue and prevented posterior closure of the palate. Syndromes are simply recurrent patterns of maldevelopment. Evaluation of the Dysmorphic Infant Physicians caring for infants with birth defects frequently must seek accurate diagnoses and provide care under conditions of great stress. The extent of an infant’s abnormalities may not be immediately apparent, and parents who feel grief and guilt are often desperate for information. As with any medical problem, however, the history and physical examination provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Special aspects of these procedures are outlined in the following sections. A. History Pregnancy histories nearly always contain important clues to the diagnosis. Parental recall after delivery of an abnormal infant is better than recall after a normal birth. An obstetric wheel can help document gestational age and events of the first trimester: the last menstrual period, the onset of symptoms of pregnancy, the date of diagnosis of the pregnancy, the date of the first prenatal visit, and the physician’s impressions of fetal growth at that time. Family histories should always be reviewed. Environ- mental histories should include descriptions of parental habits and work settings in addition to medications and use of drugs, tobacco, and alcohol. B. Physical Examination Meticulous physical examination is crucial for accurate diagno- sis in dysmorphic infants and children. In addition to the routine procedures described in Chapter 1, special attention should be paid to the neonate’s physical measurements (Figure 35–11). Photographs are helpful and should include a ruler for reference. C. Imaging and Laboratory Studies Radiologic and ultrasonographic examinations can be ex- tremely helpful in the evaluation of dysmorphic infants. Films of infants with apparent limb or skeletal anomalies should include views of the skull and all of the long bones in addition to frontal and lateral views of the axial skeleton. Chest and abdominal films should be obtained when indicated. The pedi- atrician should consult a radiologist for further workup. Com- puted tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography are all useful diagnostic tools, but their interpretation in the face of birth defects may require consider- able experience. Cytogenetic analysis provides specific diagnoses in approxi- mately 5% of dysmorphic infants who survive the newborn period. Chromosomal abnormalities are recognized in 10–15% of infants who die. Common disorders such as trisomies 21 and 18 can be determined rapidly through use of FISH, but this technique is limited and should always be accompanied by a complete karyotype. A normal karyotype does not rule out the presence of significant genetic disease. Any case requiring rapid diagnosis should be discussed with an experienced clinical geneticist. D. Perinatal Autopsy When a dysmorphic infant dies, postmortem examination can provide important diagnostic information. The pediatrician should discuss the case thoroughly with the pathologist, and photographs should always be taken. Radiologic imaging should be included whenever limb anomalies or disproportionate growth is present. Tissue, most often skin, should be submitted for cytogenetic analysis. The pediatrician and the pathologist should also consider whether samples of blood, urine, or other tissue should be obtained for biochemical analyses. Placental as well as fetal tissue can be used for viral culture. "

1025,Chromosomal Abnormalities:  Abnormal Structure,Pain Management & Palliative Care ,921,"Chromosomal Abnormalities:  Abnormal Structure Chromosomal abnormalities most often present in new- borns as multiple congenital anomalies in association with intrauterine growth retardation. In addition to trisomies as just described, other more subtle chromosomal abnormali- ties are also common. In some cases, the karyotype is normal, but a subtle chromosomal rearrangement can be detected by FISH. Another new technology, called compar- ative genomic hybridization array, enables screening for multiple submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities (ie, microdeletions) simultaneously, and may be a very helpful tool in evaluating the child with a suspected chromosomal abnormality. Although most cases of severe chromosomal abnormality such as trisomy are lethal, some individuals may survive if the abnormality exists in mosaic form. Two examples of this include trisomy 8 and cat eye syndrome, caused by extra genetic material, which is derived from a portion of chromosome 22.

CHROMOSOME DELETION DISORDERS Three common chromosomal deletion disorders that are often detected on routine karyotype analysis, and easily con- firmed via FISH assay are 1p36– syndrome, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (4p–), and cri du chat syndrome (5p–). 1. Deletion 1p36 Syndrome Microcephaly and a large anterior fontanelle are characteristic features of 1p36– syndrome. Cardiac defects are common, and dilated cardiomyopathy may present in infancy. Mental retar- dation, hypotonia, hearing loss, and seizures are usually seen. 2. Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome Also known as 4p– (deletion of 4p16), this syndrome is characterized by microcephaly and unusual development of the nose and orbits that produces an appearance suggesting an ancient Greek warrior’s helmet. Other anomalies com- monly seen include cleft lip and palate, and cardiac and renal defects. Seizure disorders are common, and the majority of patients have severe mental retardation. 3. Cri du Chat Syndrome Also known as 5p– (deletion of terminal chromosome 5p), this disorder is characterized by unique facial features, growth retardation, and microcephaly. Patients have an unusual catlike cry. Most patients have major organ anoma- lies and significant developmental delay. CHROMOSOME MICRODELETION DISORDERS Four common contiguous gene disorders (microdeletion dis- orders), which are usually suspected on the basis of an abnor- mal phenotype and then confirmed by FISH assay, are Wil- liams syndrome, Miller-Dieker syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, and velocardiofacial syndrome. 1. Williams Syndrome Williams syndrome is a contiguous gene disorder involving the elastin gene and other neighboring genes at 7q11.2. It is characterized by short stature; congenital heart disease (supra- valvular aortic stenosis); coarse, elfin-like facies with promi- nent lips; hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria in infancy; devel- opmental delay; and neonatal irritability evolving into an overly friendly personality. Calcium restriction may be nec- essary in early childhood to prevent nephrocalcinosis. The hypercalcemia often resolves during the first year of life. The natural history includes progression of cardiac disease and predisposition to hypertension and spinal osteoarthritis in adults. Most patients have mild to moderate intellectual deficits. 2. Miller-Dieker Syndrome A contiguous gene syndrome involving 17p13, this abnormal- ity is characterized by microcephaly and severe CNS dysgene- sis. The most commonly seen CNS malformation is termed lissencephaly (“smooth brain” as the brain is lacking its normal convolutions and gyri). An unusually developed face and forehead reflect abnormal migration of neuronal germinal matrix cells. Mutations in the gene MDS1, which is located in the critical region, can cause isolated lissencephaly, without the full picture of Miller-Dieker. Severe cognitive and develop- mental delay and seizure disorders are common.   CHAPTER 35 1004 3. Smith-Magenis Syndrome This syndrome is associated with microdeletion of 17p11 and is characterized by prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, cupid- shaped upper lip, self-mutilating behavior (pulling nails and hair, putting objects into body orifices), sleep disturbance, and developmental delay. Some patients also have seizure disorders. Some individuals with larger deletions involving PMP22 can present with peripheral neuropathy. 4. Velocardiofacial Syndrome  (Deletion 22q11 Syndrome) Also known as DiGeorge syndrome, this abnormality was origi- nally described in newborns presenting with cyanotic congenital heart disease, usually involving great vessel abnormalities; thymic hypoplasia leading to immunodeficiency; and hypocalcemia due to absent parathyroid glands. This chromosomal abnormality is associated with a highly variable phenotype. Characteristics include mild microcephaly, palatal clefting or incompetence, speech and language delays, and congenital heart disease (ven- tricular or atrial septal defect). Midline defects such as umbilical hernia and hypospadias can be associated anomalies. In some cases, individuals have an apparent predisposition to psychosis. "
1026,Mendelian Disorders,Pain Management & Palliative Care ,1204,"MENDELIAN DISORDERS AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT DISORDERS Neurofibromatosis, Marfan syndrome, achondroplasia, osteo- genesis imperfecta, and the craniosynostoses are among the most well known autosomal dominant disorders. There are many other common autosomal dominant disorders, including Treacher Collins syndrome, associated with a distinct craniofa- cial phenotype including malar and mandibular hypoplasia, and Noonan syndrome, which has a phenotype similar to Turner syndrome and is characterized by short stature and a webbed neck. Two other common genetic disorders whose causative genes were recently identified and found to be dominant muta- tions are CHARGE syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. 1. Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders, occurring in 1:3000 births and seen in all races and ethnic groups. In general, the disorder is progressive, with new manifestations appearing over time. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF-2), characterized by bilateral acoustic neuromas, with minimal or no skin manifestations, is a different disease caused by a different gene. The gene for NF-1 is on the long arm of chromosome 17 and seems to code for a protein similar to a tumor suppresser factor. NF results from many different mutations of this gene. Approximately half of all NF cases are caused by new mutations. Careful evaluation of the parents is necessary to provide accu- rate genetic counseling. Recent evidence suggests that pene- trance is close to 100% in those who carry the gene if individuals are examined carefully. Café-au-lait macules may be present at birth, and about 80% of individuals with NF-1 will have more than six by age 1 year. Neurofibromas are benign tumors consisting of Schwann cells, nerve fibers, and fibroblasts; they may be discrete or plexiform. The incidence of Lisch nodules, which can be seen with a slit lamp, also increases with age. Affected individuals commonly have a large head, bony abnormalities on radiographic studies, scoliosis, and a wide spectrum of developmental problems. Although the average IQ is within the normal range, it is lower than in unaffected family mem- bers. (For more details of medical evaluation and treatment, see Chapter 23 of this book.) Useful information is provided on the following web site: http://www.nfinc.org. Hyperpigmented macules can occur in other conditions such as Albright, Noonan, and Leopard syndromes, but the lesions are either single or different in character. 2. Marfan Syndrome ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Skeletal abnormalities (Ghent criteria).  Lens dislocation.  Dilation of the aortic root.  Dural ectasia.  Positive family history.  Clinical Findings Genetic testing is available for mutations causing Marfan syndrome, but the diagnosis remains largely clinical and is based on the Ghent criteria (available at http://www.genetests. org). Children most often present with a positive family history, suspicious skeletal findings, or ophthalmologic com- plications. Motor milestones are frequently delayed due to joint laxity and mild myopathy. Adolescents are prone to spontaneous pneumothorax. Dysrhythmias may be present. Aortic and valvular complications are not common in chil- dren but are more likely in sporadic cases. The characteristic facies is long and thin, with down-slanting palpebral fissures. The palate is high arched, and dentition is often crowded. The uvula may be bifid. Marfan syndrome is genetically heterogeneous. Mutations in the gene for fibrillin1 proteins (FBN1) are most common but mutations in (FBN2) and in transforming growth factor β receptors (TGFBR1 and 2) can also produce phenotypes that fit criteria for a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.  Differential Diagnosis Homocystinuria should be excluded through metabolic testing in all individuals with marfanoid skeletal features. An    CHAPTER 35 1008 and variability in presentation appears to involve expression of neighboring genes, including a more centromeric SMN2 pseudo- gene. Approximately 2–5% of patients affected with SMA will be compound heterozygotes in whom there is one copy of SMN1 with exon 7 deleted and a second copy with a point mutation. Prenatal diagnosis is available through genetic testing, but careful molecular analysis of the proband and demonstration of carrier status in parents is advised since, in addition to the problem of potential compound heterozygosity, 2% of cases occur as a result of a de novo mutation in one SMN1 allele. In this case one of the parents is not a carrier and recurrence risks are low. Carrier testing is further complicated by a duplication of SMN1 in 4% of the population that results in there being two SMN1 genes on one of their chromosomes. Hence reproductive risk assessment, carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis of SMA are best undertaken in the context of careful genetic counseling. 5. Metabolic Disorders Most inborn errors of metabolism are inherited in an auto- somal recessive pattern. (See Chapter 34 in this text for detailed explanations of these disorders.) X-LINKED DISORDERS 1. Duchenne & Becker Muscular Dystrophies Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) results from failure of synthesis of the muscle cytoskeletal protein dystrophin, the gene for which is located on the X chromosome, Xp12. Approxi- mately 1 in 4000 male children are affected. Mutations in the same gene that result in partial expression of the dystrophin protein produce a less severe phenotype, Becker muscular dys- trophy (BMD). In both DMD and BMD, progressive degenera- tion of skeletal and cardiac muscle occurs. Boys with DMD exhibit proximal muscle weakness and pseudo-hypertrophy of calf muscles by age 5–6 years. Patients become nonambulatory by age 13. Serum creatine kinase levels are markedly elevated. Boys with DMD frequently die in their 20s of respiratory failure and cardiac dysfunction. The prognosis for BMD is more variable. Although corticosteroids are useful in maintaining strength, they do not slow progression of the disorder. The gene for dystrophin is very large and a common target for mutation. Large deletions or duplications can be detected in the gene for dystrophin in 65% of cases. Methods for detecting small and even point mutations have now been developed. Mutation testing and careful clinical assessment are replacing muscle biopsies in making the diagnosis of DMD. One third of DMD cases presenting with a negative family history are likely to be new mutations. Genetic coun- seling is complicated by the fact that germline mosaicism for mutations in the dystrophin gene occur in approximately 15–20% of families. Therefore, if a mutation has been detected in a proband, prenatal diagnosis is routinely offered to his mother regardless of her apparent carrier status. It is also necessary to look for mutations in all sisters of affected boys. Since mutations are now detected in the great majority of DMD cases, there is considerably less need for estimating carrier risks based on creatine kinase levels or using genetic linkage for prenatal diagnosis. Nonetheless, counseling and prenatal diagnosis remain difficult in some families. (Addi- tional information about muscular dystrophies is included in Chapter 23.) 2. Hemophilia Hemophilia A is an X-linked, recessive, bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in the activity of coagulation factor VIII. Affected individuals develop a variable phenotype of hemorrhage into joints and muscles, easy bruising, and prolonged bleeding from wounds. The disorder is caused by heterogeneous mutations in the factor VIII gene, which maps to Xq28. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis can be done by direct detection of selected mutations, especially the inversions, the most common gene change, as well as indi- rectly by linkage analysis. Replacement of factor VIII is done using a variety of preparations derived from human plasma or recombinant techniques. Although replacement therapy is effective in most cases, 10–15% of treated individuals develop neutralizing antibodies that decrease its effective- ness. (See Chapter 28 in this text for additional discussion.) 3. Metabolic Disorders Some important inborn errors are inherited as X-linked disorders, such as adrenoleukodystrophy. (See Chapter 32 in this text for more detailed descriptions.) NONMENDELIAN DISORDERS DISORDERS OF IMPRINTING 1. Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome The association of macrosomia (enlarged body size), macro- glossia (enlarged tongue), and omphalocele constitutes the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), now known to be related to abnormal expression of genes located at chromo- some 11p15. Other associated findings include mild facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism, unusual ear creases), infantile hypoglycemia due to transient hyperinsulinemia, multiple congenital anomalies (cleft palate and genitourinary anoma- lies common), and increased risk for certain malignancies, especially Wilms tumor (7–10%). A growth factor gene, IGF2, is imprinted such that the maternal allele is ordinarily not expressed during intrauterine development. Chromosomal abnormalities affecting expres- sion of this gene, such as duplication of the paternal 11p15 region, or paternal UPD, are associated with BWS. Paternal UPD may also lead to loss of expression of a tumor suppres- sor gene (H19), normally read from the maternal homolog, contributing to the increased predisposition to cancer seen in  "

Approximately 2–5% of patients affected with SMA will be compound heterozygotes in whom there is one copy of SMN1 with exon 7 deleted and a second copy with a point mutation. Prenatal diagnosis is available through genetic testing, but careful molecular analysis of the proband and demonstration of carrier status in parents is advised since, in addition to the problem of potential compound heterozygosity, 2% of cases occur as a result of a de novo mutation in one SMN1 allele.

Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome The association of macrosomia (enlarged body size), macro- glossia (enlarged tongue), and omphalocele constitutes the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), now known to be related to abnormal expression of genes located at chromo- some 11p15.

Supporting evidence for the role of imprinting in BWS is that paternal imprinting has been documented in about 10% of BWS patients, and that about 70% of Wilms tumors from patients with BWS show loss of imprinting of the genes coding for IGF2 and H19. Children affected with BWS should undergo tumor surveillance protocols, including an abdominal ultrasound every 3 months until they reach age 7 years, as diagnosing malignancy at early stages leads to a significant improvement in outcome. 2. Prader-Willi Syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome results from lack of expression of several imprinted genes, including SNRPn, located on chro- mosome 15q11. Clinical characteristics include severe hypo- tonia in infancy that often necessitates placement of a feed- ing gastrostomy tube. In older children, characteristic facies evolve over time, including almond-shaped eyes, along with frequent strabismus. Short stature, obesity, hypogenitalism, and small hands and feet with tapering fingers are now believed to be associated with growth hormone deficiency. Obsessive hyperphagia (usual onset 3–4 years) and type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes mellitus are common features. Multiple chromosomal rearrangements and mutations have been reported to disrupt expression of the genes that contribute to this syndrome. Of these, deletion of the pater- nally inherited allele of chromosome 15q11 (detected by FISH) is the most common chromosomal abnormality caus- ing Prader-Willi syndrome, followed by maternal UPD, diagnosed by DNA methylation studies. 3. Angelman Syndrome Angelman syndrome also involves imprinting and results from a variety of mutations that inactivate a ubiquitin- protein ligase gene, UBE3A, located in the same region of chromosome 15 as SNRPn, the maternally imprinted gene involved in Prader-Willi syndrome (see preceding section). UBE3A is paternally imprinted, and during normal develop- ment the maternal allele is expressed only in the brain. The classic phenotype includes severe mental retardation with prognathism, seizures, and marked delay in motor mile- stones, abnormal puppet-like gait and posturing, poor lan- guage development, and paroxysmal laughter and tongue thrusting. Angelman syndrome is most commonly caused when sequences detectable by FISH on 15q11 are deleted from the maternal homolog. Uniparental paternal disomy 15 is the least common cause. Mutations in UBE3A cause the disorder in about one fourth of cases. Imprinting errors, which may be associated with advanced reproductive techniques, may also result in Angelman syndrome. Niemitz EL, Feinberg AP: Epigenetics and assisted reproductive technology: A call for investigation. Am J Hum Genet 2004;74:599 [PMID: 14991528]. 4. Uniparental Disomy for Chromosome 7 Certain genes on chromosome 7 are now known to be imprinted. UPD7 has been reported to cause cystic fibrosis in a child who inherited two copies of the ΔF508 deletion from one parent. That child also had Russell-Silver syn- drome, a syndrome associated with intrauterine growth failure and dwarfism. Imprinting abnormalities and UPD may prove to be associated with growth abnormalities. DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTICIPATION 1. (Autosomal Dominant)  Myotonic Dystrophy Most myotonic dystrophy, an autosomal dominant condi- tion characterized by muscle weakness and tonic muscle spasms (myotonia) along with hypogonadism, frontal bald- ing, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and cataracts, pre- sents in adults. This disorder occurs when a CTG repeat in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19 expands to 50 or more copies. Normal individuals have from 5–35 CTG repeat copies. Individuals carrying 35–49 repeats are generally asymptomatic, but repeat copies greater than 35 are meioti- cally unstable and tend to further expand when passed to subsequent generations. Individuals with 50–100 copies may be only mildly affected (eg, cataracts). Most individuals with repeat copies greater than 100 will have symptoms or electri- cal myotonia as adults. As unstable alleles continue to expand and copy numbers approach 400, symptoms become evident in children. Expansion greater than 1000 copies produces fetal and neo- natal disease that can be lethal. Expansion from approxi- mately 200–400 repeat copies produces mild, often clinically undetected symptoms, while very large copy numbers (800– 2000) are associated with fetal manifestations (polyhydram- nios and arthrogryposis). This occurs most frequently when the unstable repeats are passed through an affected mother. Therefore, an important component in the workup of the floppy or weak infant is a careful neurologic assessment of both parents for evidence of weakness or myotonia. Molecu- lar testing that measures the number of CTG repeats is diagnostic clinically and prenatally. (See Chapter 23 for additional discussion.) 2. (Autosomal Recessive) Friedreich Ataxia Symptoms of Friedreich ataxia include loss of coordination (cerebellar dysfunction) with both motor and sensory find- ings beginning in preadolescence and typically progressing through the teenage years. The gene involved, FDRA, is located on chromosome 9. Normal individuals carry 7–33 GAA repeats at this locus. Close to 96% of affected patients are homozygous for repeat expansions that exceed 66 copies. However, point mutations in the gene also occur. Meiotic instability for GAA repeats is more variable than for others  CHAPTER 35 1010 and contractions occur more frequently than do expansions. Relationships between genotype and phenotype are also more complex. Molecular diagnostic testing requires careful interpretation with respect to prognosis and reproductive risks. (See Chapter 23 for additional discussion.) 3. (X-Linked) Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome, present in approximately 1 in 1000 males, is the most common cause of cognitive disabilities (mental retardation) in males. The responsible gene is FMR1, which has unstable CGG repeats at the 5' end. Normal individuals have up to 50 CGG repeats. Individuals with 51–200 CGG repeats have a premutation and may manifest symptoms including developmental, behavioral, and physical traits, premature ovarian failure in a subset of females; and a progressive, neurologic deterioration in older males called FXTAS (fragile X–associated tremor- ataxia syndrome). Affected individuals with fragile X syn- drome (full mutation) have more than 200 CGG repeats and also have hypermethylation of both the CGG expan- sion and an adjacent CpG island. This methylation turns off the FMR1 gene. DNA analysis, rather than cytogenetic testing, is the method of choice for confirming the diagno- sis of fragile X syndrome.  Clinical Features Most males with fragile X syndrome present with intellectual disabilities, oblong facies with large ears, and large testicles, especially after puberty. Other physical signs include symp- toms suggestive of a connective tissue disorder (eg, hyperex- tensible joints or mitral valve prolapse). Many affected indi- viduals are hyperactive and exhibit infantile autism or autistic-like behavior. About half of females with the fragile X full mutation show normal intelligence, but may evidence mild learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Unlike other X-linked disorders where female heterozygotes are asymptomatic, half of females with the full mutation have lower IQs in the range of mental retardation and more severe behavioral problems. Females have more mild phenotypic changes than the males. Clinical expression of fragile X differs in male and female offspring depending on which parent is transmitting the gene. The premutation can change into the full mutation only when passed through a female. Identification of the abnormal DNA amplification by direct DNA analysis can confirm the diagnosis of fragile X in an affected individual and can detect asymptomatic gene carriers of both sexes. Therefore, DNA analysis is a reliable test for prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of fragile X syndrome and facilitates genetic counseling. (Management considerations for patients with fragile X syndrome are described in Chapter 2.) Hagerman PJ, Hagerman RJ: The fragile-X premutation: A maturing perspective. Am J Hum Genet 2004;74:805 [PMID: 15052536]. DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH  MITOCHONDRIAL INHERITANCE More than 100 point mutations and rearrangements of mtDNA have been identified, which are associated with a large number of human diseases. Symptoms of mitochon- drial disorders are secondary to deficiency in the respiratory chain enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation, which supply energy to all cells. Mitochondrial diseases are usually pro- gressive disorders with neurologic dysfunction including hypotonia, developmental delay, and seizures. Ophthalmo- logic issues, hearing loss, gastrointestinal tract dysfunction with growth failure, renal, endocrine, cardiac, and auto- nomic dysfunction are some of the many issues which can affect patients with mitochondrial diseases. The following disorders are three of the more common ones. 1. MELAS MELAS is an acronym for mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. Symptoms occur in the pediatric age group and include recurrent episodes resembling stroke (blindness, paralysis), headache, vomiting, weakness of proximal muscles, and elevated blood lactate. (Note: Lactate may be falsely elevated secondary to technical difficulties in obtaining a free-flowing blood specimen or delay in laboratory measurement.) The most common mutation causing MELAS is in the tRNALeu gene (A3243G). 2. MERRF MERRF is an acronym for myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers. Children with MERRF present with a variety of neurologic symptoms, including myoclonus, deafness, weak- ness of muscles, and seizures. Eighty percent of cases are due to a missense mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALys gene (A8344G). 3. Leigh Subacute Necrotizing  Encephalomyelopathy Multiple different abnormalities in respiratory chain function lead to Leigh disease, a very severe disorder associated with progressive loss of developmental milestones, along with extrapyramidal symptoms and brainstem dysfunction. Epi- sodes of deterioration are frequently associated with an inter- current febrile illness. Symptoms include hypotonia, unusual choreoathetoid hand movements, feeding dysfunction with failure to thrive, and seizures. Focal necrotic lesions of the brainstem and thalamus are hallmarks on MRI scan. Mito- chondrial mutations affecting the respiratory chain, especially complexes I, II, and IV, and nuclear DNA mutations affecting complex II have been identified as causing Leigh disease.

1033,Disorders of Multifactorial Inheritance,Pain Management & Palliative Care ,32,"DISORDERS OF  MULTIFACTORIAL INHERITANCE CLEFT LIP & CLEFT PALATE ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Cleft lip is more common in males, cleft palate in females.  Cleft lip and palate may be isolated defects (nonsyn- dromic) or associated with other anomalies as part of a genetic disorder (syndromic).  Pierre Robin anomalad, the association of cleft palate, micrognathia, and glossoptosis may lead to severe airway complications in young infants, necessitating tracheostomy.  General Considerations From a genetic standpoint, cleft lip with or without cleft palate is distinct from isolated cleft palate. Although both can occur in a single family, particularly in association with certain syndromes, this pattern is unusual. Racial back- ground is a factor in the incidence of facial clefting. Among Asians, Caucasians, and blacks, the incidence is 1.61, 0.9, and 0.31, respectively, per 1000 live births.  Clinical Findings A cleft lip may be unilateral or bilateral and complete or incomplete. It may occur with a cleft of the entire palate or just the primary (anterior and gingival ridge) or secondary (posterior) palate. An isolated cleft palate can involve only the soft palate or both the soft and hard palates. It can be a V-shaped or a wide horseshoe, U-shaped cleft. When the cleft palate is associated with micrognathia and glossoptosis (a tongue that falls back and causes respiratory or feeding problems), it is called the Pierre Robin sequence or anom- alad. Among individuals with facial clefts—more commonly those with isolated cleft palate—the incidence of other congenital abnormalities is increased, with up to a 60% association with other anomalies or syndromes. The inci- dence of congenital heart disease, for example, is 1–2% in liveborn infants, but among those with Pierre Robin sequence it can be as high as 15%. Associated abnormalities should be looked for in the period immediately after birth and before surgery.  Differential Diagnosis A facial cleft may occur in many different circumstances. It may be an isolated abnormality or part of a more generalized syndrome. Prognosis, management, and accurate determi- nation of recurrence risks all depend on accurate diagnosis. In evaluating a child with a facial cleft, the physician must determine if the cleft is nonsyndromic or syndromic. A. Nonsyndromic In the past, nonsyndromic cleft lip or cleft palate was considered a classic example of polygenic or multifactorial inheritance. More recently, however, this mode of inheri- tance has been questioned, and several studies have sug- gested one or more major autosomal loci, both recessive and dominant (or co-dominant). Empirically, however, the recurrence risk is still in the range of 2–3% because of nonpenetrance or the presence of other contributing genes. B. Syndromic Cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, and isolated cleft palate may occur in a variety of syndromes that may be environ- mental, chromosomal, single gene, or of unknown origin (Table 35–3). Prognosis and accurate recurrence risks depend on the correct diagnosis.  Complications Problems associated with facial clefts include early feeding difficulties, which may be severe; airway obstruction necessi- tating tracheostomy; recurrent serous otitis media associated with fluctuating hearing and language delays; speech prob- lems, including language delay, hypernasality, and articula- tion errors; and dental and orthodontic complications.  Treatment A. Medical Therapy Long-term management ideally should be provided through a multidisciplinary cleft palate clinic.  Table 35–3. Syndromic isolated cleft palate (CP)  and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/CP). Environmental Maternal seizures, anticonvulsant usage (CL/CP or CP) Fetal alcohol syndrome (CP) Amniotic band syndrome (CL/CP) Chromosomal Trisomies 13 and 18 (CL/CP) Wolf-Hirschhorn or 4p– syndrome (CL/CP) Shprintzen or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (CP) Single-gene disorders Treacher Collins syndrome, AD (CP) Stickler syndrome, AD (CP) Smith-Lemli-Opitz, AR (CP) Unknown cause Moebius syndrome (CP) AD, autosomal dominant; AR, autosomal recessive.   GENETICS & DYSMORPHOLOGY 1013 rence risk for siblings of the parents and siblings of the patients is 1–2%. A patient with spina bifida has a 5% chance of having an affected child. Prenatal diagnosis is possible. In fetuses with open neural tube defects, maternal serum α- fetoprotein levels measured at 16–18 weeks’ gestation are elevated. α-Fetoprotein and acetylcholine esterase levels in amniotic fluid are also elevated. Ultrasound studies alone will detect approximately 90% of neural tube defects. Prophylactic folic acid can significantly lower the inci- dence and recurrence rate of neural tube defects, if the intake of the folic acid starts at least 3 months prior to conception and continues for the first month of pregnancy, at a dose of 4 mg/d for women at increased risk. For women of childbear- ing age without a family history of neural tube defects, the dose is 0.4 mg of folic acid daily. Folic acid supplementation prior to conception may also lower the incidence of other congenital malformations such as conotruncal heart defects.  Special Issues & Prognosis All children requiring multiple surgical procedures (ie, patients with spina bifida or urinary tract anomalies) have a significant risk for developing hypersensitivity type I (IgE- mediated) allergic reactions to latex. For this reason, nonla- tex medical products are now routinely used when caring for patients with neural tube defects. Most individuals with spina bifida are cognitively nor- mal, but learning disabilities are common. Individuals with encephalocele or other CNS malformations generally have a much poorer intellectual prognosis. Individuals with closed spinal cord abnormalities (eg, sacral lipomas) have more mild issues in general, and intelligence is usually normal. Problems in older patients include the development of spinal cord tethering, which usually presents with back pain, pro- gressive scoliosis, and changes in bowel or bladder function. This often requires neurosurgical intervention. Individuals with neural tube defects have lifelong medical issues, requiring the input of a multidisciplinary medical team. A good support for families is the national Spina Bifida Association, at the following web site: http://www.sbaa.org. "
1035,Common Recognizable Disorders with  Variable or Unknown Cause,Pain Management & Palliative Care ,2246,"COMMON RECOGNIZABLE DISORDERS  WITH VARIABLE OR UNKNOWN CAUSE The text that follows describes several important and com- mon human malformation syndromes. The best illustrations of these syndromes are found in Smith’s Recognizable Pat- terns of Human Malformation. An excellent Internet site at the University of Kansas Medical Center can be consulted for further information: http://www.kumc.edu/gec/support. 1. Arthrogryposis Multiplex Arthrogryposis multiplex is due to lack of fetal movement. Causes most often involve constraint, CNS maldevelopment or injury, and neuromuscular disorders. Polyhydramnios is often present as a result of lack of fetal swallowing. Pulmonary hypoplasia may also be present, reflecting lack of fetal breathing. The workup includes brain imaging, careful consideration of metabolic disease, neurologic consultation, and, in some cases, electrophysiologic studies and muscle biopsy. The parents should be examined, and a family history reviewed carefully for findings such as muscle weakness or cramping, cataracts, and early-onset heart disease, suggesting myotonic dystrophy. 2. Goldenhar Syndrome Goldenhar syndrome, also known as vertebro-auriculo- facial syndrome, is an association of multiple anomalies involving the head and neck. The classic phenotype includes hemifacial microsomia (one side of the face smaller than the other), and abnormalities of the pinna on the same side with associated deafness. Ear anomalies may be quite severe and include anotia. A characteristic benign fatty tumor in the outer eye, called an epibulbar dermoid, is frequently present, as are preauricular ear tags. Vertebral anomalies, particularly of the cervical vertebrae, are common. The Arnold-Chiari type I malformation (herniation of the cerebellum into the cervical spinal canal) is a common associated anomaly. Cardiac anomalies and hydrocephalus are seen in more severe cases. Most patients with Goldenhar syndrome have normal intelligence. The cause is unknown; however, there is significant overlap with the Townes-Brocks syndrome, now known to be caused by mutations in the SALL1 gene. 3. Kabuki Syndrome Kabuki syndrome is a disorder of unknown cause character- ized by a distinctive facial appearance (hypertelorism with long palpebral fissures, large pinnae), developmental delay, and hearing loss. Most cases are sporadic, although a few cases with dominant transmission have been reported. Anomalies of the heart and genitourinary system are occasionally seen. 4. Oligohydramnios Sequence  (Potter Sequence) This condition presents in newborns as severe respiratory distress due to pulmonary hypoplasia in association with posi- tional deformities of the extremities, usually bilateral clubfeet, and typical facies consisting of suborbital creases, depressed nasal tip and low-set ears, and retrognathia. The sequence may be due to prolonged lack of amniotic fluid. Most often it is due to leakage, renal agenesis, or severe obstructive uropathy. 5. Opitz G/BBB Syndrome Disrupted development of midline structures is a feature of several overlapping malformation syndromes, a number of them heritable. Hypertelorism (wide set eyes), midbrain anom- alies (agenesis of the corpus callosum), cardiac septal defects, and genitourinary tract anomalies (hypospadias) are the most    CHAPTER 35 1014 common features. Current clinical genetic terminology refers to these conditions as Opitz G/BBB syndrome. Hypotonia and problems with swallowing and gastroesophageal reflux are hallmark symptoms. Mentation is usually subnormal. Both autosomal dominant and X-linked inheritance have been doc- umented. Linkage studies have recently identified a candidate gene dubbed M101 on the X chromosome. Several patients with Opitz G/BBB syndrome have also been shown by FISH to have deletions of 22q11. Additional resources include the Opitz Family Network and the Opitz G/BBB Family Network and the following web site: http://www.opitznet.org/joinus.html. 6. Overgrowth Syndromes Overgrowth syndromes are becoming increasingly recognized as important childhood conditions. They may present at birth and are characterized by macrocephaly, motor delays (cerebral hypotonia), and, in many cases, asymmetry of extremities. Bone age may be advanced. The most common overgrowth syndrome is Sotos syndrome. Patients with Sotos syndrome have a characteristic facies with a prominent forehead and down-slanting palpebral features. The cause of the syndrome is unknown. Patients have a small but increased risk of cancer. Other overgrowth syndromes include Beckwith-Wiede- mann syndrome (BWS), described earlier, and two single gene disorders, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome and Bannayan- Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. Patients with Simpson-Golabi- Behmel syndrome exhibit a BWS-like phenotype, but with additional anomalies, including polydactyly and more severe facial dysmorphism. Unlike patients with BWS, who have normal intelligence, patients with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome often have developmental delay. It is inherited as an X-linked disorder. Patients with Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome have macrosomia, macrocephaly, and unusual freckling of the penis. They have mild developmental issues and may present with autism. They may develop hemangio- matous or lymphangiomatous growths and have a predisposi- tion to intestinal malignancies. The cause of Bannayan-Riley- Ruvalcaba syndrome was recently found to be a mutation of the PTEN gene implicated in Cowden syndrome, the associa- tion of intestinal polyposis with malignant potential. 7. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is a genetic disorder of unknown cause, characterized by developmental delay, growth failure, and a distinctive facial dysmorphology comprising micro- cephaly, prominent nose, and small chin. Feeding problems are common. About 25% of patients have been found with a microdeletion of chromosome 16 detectable by FISH, but most patients have a normal karyotype. 8. Syndromic Short Stature Short stature is an important component of numerous syn- dromes, or it may be an isolated finding. In the absence of nutritional deficiencies, endocrine abnormalities, evidence of skeletal dysplasia (disproportionate growth with abnormal skeletal films), or a positive family history, intrinsic short stature can be due to UPD. The phenotype of Russell-Silver syndrome—short stature with normal head growth (pseudo- hydrocephalus), normal development, and minor dysmor- phic features (especially fifth finger clinodactyly)—has been associated in some cases with maternal UPD7. 9. VACTERL Association ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES VACTERL association is described by an acronym  denoting the association of:  Vertebral defects (segmentation anomalies).  Imperforate anus.  Cardiac malformation (most often ventricular septal defect).  Tracheo-esophageal fistula.  Renal anomalies.  Limb (most often radial ray) anomalies. The disorder is sporadic, and some of the defects may be life- threatening. The prognosis for normal development is good. The cause is unknown, but a high association with monozy- gotic twinning suggests a mechanism dating back to events perhaps as early as blastogenesis. Recently, disturbance of the sonic hedgehog pathway was suggested to be part of the mechanism for VACTERL, based on a mouse model. Careful examination and follow-up are important, because numerous other syndromes have overlapping features, such as the SALL4 mutation that leads to Okihiro syndrome, Duane- Radial ray syndrome, and IVIC syndrome, which has a recur- rence risk of 50%. In addition, Feingold syndrome, which is caused by mutation in the MYCN gene, and a newly described STAR syndrome due to a novel gene identified on the X chromosome need to be excluded.

1040,Asthma,Immunodeficiency ,499,"asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis has been accompanied by significant morbidity and school absentee- ism, with adverse consequences for school performance and quality of life, as well as economic burden measured in billions of dollars. Understanding the language of allergy and the basic mechanisms involved may help physicians when treating these disorders. In this chapter, atopy refers to a genetically determined predisposition to develop IgE anti- bodies found in patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. This chapter discusses the major allergic disorders seen in pediatric practice. ASTHMA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Episodic symptoms of airflow obstruction including wheezing, cough, and chest tightness.  Airflow obstruction at least partially reversible.  Exclusion of alternative diagnoses.  General Considerations Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting over 6 million children in the United States, and almost two of every three children affected have had at least one attack due to asthma in the past year. Despite advances in the understanding of asthma, associated morbidity and mortality rates are still historically high. Recent data suggest that death rates appear to have stabilized, yet the rate has not declined for black children. Although asthma prevalence in children increases with age, health care utilization is most marked among the very young. The prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates for asthma are higher among minority and inner city populations. The reasons for this are unclear but may be related to a combination of more severe disease, poor access to health care, lack of asthma education, delay in prescribing appropriate controller therapy, and environ- mental factors (eg, irritants including smoke and air pollut- ants, and perennial allergen exposure). Up to 80% of children with asthma develop symptoms before their fifth birthday. Atopy (personal or familial) is the strongest identifiable predisposing factor. Exposure to tobac- co smoke, especially from the mother, is also a risk factor for asthma. About 40% of infants and young children who have wheezing with viral infections in the first few years of life will have continuing asthma through childhood. Sensitization to inhalant allergens increases over time and is found in the majority of children with asthma. The principal allergens associated with asthma are perennial aeroallergens such as dust mite, animal dander, cockroach, and Alternaria (a soil mold). Rarely, foods may provoke isolated asthma symp- toms. Other triggers include exercise, cold air, cigarette smoke, pollutants, strong chemical odors, and rapid changes in barometric pressure. Aspirin sensitivity is uncommon in children. Psychological factors may precipitate asthma exac- erbations and place the patient at high risk from the disease. Pathologic features of asthma include shedding of airway epithelium, edema, mucus plug formation, mast cell activa- tion, and collagen deposition beneath the basement mem- brane. The inflammatory cell infiltrate includes eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, especially in fatal asthma exacerbations. Airway inflammation contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, and disease chro- nicity. Persistent airway inflammation can lead to airway wall remodeling and irreversible changes. Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use.    CHAPTER 36 1034 5. Patient discharge—Criteria for discharging patients home from the office or emergency department should include a sustained response of at least 1 hour to bronchodila- tor therapy with FEV1 or PEFR greater than 70% of predicted or personal best and oxygen saturation greater than 90% in room air. Prior to discharge, the patient’s or caregiver’s ability to continue therapy and assess symptoms appropriately needs to be considered. Patients should be given an action plan for management of recurrent symptoms or exacerbations, and instructions about medications should be reviewed. The inhaled SABA and oral corticosteroids should be continued, the latter for 3–10 days. Finally, the patient or caregiver should be instructed about the follow-up visit, typically within 1 week. Hospitalized patients should receive more intensive education prior to discharge. Referral to an asthma specialist should be considered for all children with severe exacerbations or multiple emergency department visits or hospitalizations.  Prognosis Since the 1970s, morbidity rates for asthma have increased, and mortality rates may have stabilized. Mortality statistics indicate that a high percentage of deaths have resulted from under-recognition of asthma severity and undertreatment, particularly in labile asthmatic patients and in asthmatic patients whose perception of pulmonary obstruction is poor. Long-term outcome studies suggest that children with mild symptoms generally outgrow their asthma, while patients with more severe symptoms, marked airway hyperresponsiveness, and a greater degree of atopy tend to have persistent disease. In a recently published report of an unselected birth cohort from New Zealand, more than one in four children had wheezing that persisted from childhood to adulthood or that relapsed after remission. Recent evidence suggests that early intervention with anti-inflammatory therapy does not alter the development of persistent asthma, and it is also unclear if such intervention or environmental control measures influ- ence the natural history of childhood asthma. Nonetheless, the pediatrician or primary care provider together with the asthma specialist has the responsibility to optimize control and, it is hoped, reduce the severity of asthma in children. Interventions that can have long-term effects such as halting progression or inducing remission are necessary to decrease the public health burden of this common condition.

It frequently coexists with asthma and is a risk factor for subsequent development of asthma. Prevalence of this disease increases during child- hood, peaking at 15% in the postadolescent years. Although allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is more common in boys during early childhood, there is little difference in incidence between the sexes after adolescence. Race and socioeconomic status are not considered to be important factors. The pathologic changes in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis are chiefly hyperemia, edema, and increased serous and mucoid secretions caused by mediator release, all of which lead to variable degrees of nasal obstruction, pruritus, and rhinor- rhea. This process may involve the eyes and other structures,   ALLERGIC DISORDERS  1037 D. Immunotherapy Allergen immunotherapy should be considered when symp- toms are severe and due to unavoidable exposure to inhalant allergens, especially if symptomatic measures have failed. Immunotherapy is the only form of therapy that may alter the course of the disease. It should not be prescribed by sending the patient’s serum to a laboratory where extracts based on in-vitro tests are prepared for the patient (ie, the remote practice of allergy). Subcutaneous immunotherapy should be done in a facility where a physician prepared to treat anaphylaxis is present. Patients with concomitant asthma should not receive an injection if their asthma is not under good control (ie, peak flows preinjection are below 80% of personal best), and the patient should wait for 25–30 minutes after an injection before leaving the facility. Out- comes with single allergen immunotherapy show success rates of approximately 80%. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown, but data suggest that immunotherapy for 3–5 years may have lasting benefit.  Prognosis Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis associated with sensitization to indoor allergens tends to be protracted unless specific aller- gens can be identified and eliminated from the environment. In seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, symptoms are usu- ally most severe from adolescence through mid-adult life. After moving to a region devoid of problem allergens, patients may be symptom-free for several years, but they can develop new sensitivities to local aeroallergens.

1059,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunodeficiency ,1812,"ATOPIC DERMATITIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Pruritus.  Facial and extensor involvement in infants and young children.  Flexural lichenification in older children and adolescents.  Chronic or relapsing dermatitis.  Personal or family history of atopic disease.  General Considerations Atopic dermatitis is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease typically associated with respiratory allergy. Over half of patients with atopic dermatitis will develop asthma and allergic rhinitis—often as they outgrow their atopic dermatitis. A subset of patients with atopic dermatitis has been shown to have mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin, a protein essential for normal epidermal barrier function. These patients have early-onset, more severe and persistent disease. Mutations in filaggrin have also been associated with increased risk for asthma, but only in patients with atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis may result in significant morbidity, leading to school absenteeism, occupational disability, and emotional stress. The disease presents in early childhood, with onset prior to age 5 years in approximately 90% of patients.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Atopic dermatitis has no pathognomonic skin lesions or laboratory parameters. Diagnosis is based on the clinical features, including severe pruritus, a chronically relapsing course, and typical morphology and distribution of the skin lesions. Acute atopic dermatitis is characterized by intensely pruritic, erythematous papules associated with excoriations, vesiculations, and serous exudate; subacute atopic dermatitis by erythematous, excoriated, scaling papules; and chronic atopic dermatitis by thickened skin with accentuated mark- ings (lichenification) and fibrotic papules. Patients with chronic atopic dermatitis may have all three types of lesions present concurrently. Patients usually have dry, “lackluster” skin. During infancy, atopic dermatitis involves primarily the face, scalp, and extensor surfaces of the extremities. The diaper area is usually spared. When involved, it may be secondarily infected with Candida. In older patients with long-standing disease, the flexural folds of the extremities are the predominant location of lesions. B. Laboratory Findings Identification of allergens involves taking a careful history and performing selective immediate hypersensitivity skin tests or in-vitro tests when appropriate. Negative skin tests with proper controls have a high predictive value for ruling out a suspected allergen. Positive skin tests have a lower correlation with clinical symptoms in suspected food aller- gen–induced atopic dermatitis and should be confirmed with double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges unless there is a coincidental history of anaphylaxis to the suspected food. Alternatively, specific IgE levels to milk, egg, peanut, and fish proteins have been established with the Phadia ImmunoCAP assay correlating with a greater than 95% chance of a clinical reaction. Elevated serum IgE levels can be demonstrated in 80– 85% of patients with atopic dermatitis, and a similar number have positive immediate skin tests or in-vitro tests with food and inhalant allergens. Several well-controlled studies sug- gest that specific allergens can influence the course of this   ALLERGIC DISORDERS  1041 monitored, the patient and family can receive intense educa- tion, and controlled provocative challenges can be con- ducted to help identify triggering factors. Ultraviolet light therapy can be useful for chronic recalci- trant atopic dermatitis in a subset of patients under the supervision of a specialist. Photochemotherapy with oral methoxypsoralen therapy followed by UVA (ultraviolet A) has been used in a limited number of children with severe atopic dermatitis unresponsive to other therapy, and signifi- cant improvement has been noted. However, the increased long-term risk of cutaneous malignancies from this therapy prevents its widespread use. Limited published data are available on use of the sys- temic immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine in children. In an open study, children given oral cyclosporine, 5 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks, improved significantly and tolerated the treatment well. Unfortunately, discontinuation of treatment resulted in relapse, although the relapse rate was variable. Patients treated with this agent should have their dose titrated to the lowest effective dose after the disease is brought under control with appropriate monitoring, under the care of a specialist familiar with the drug. K. Experimental and Unproved Therapies Several uncontrolled trials have suggested that desensitization to specific allergens may improve atopic dermatitis; however, controlled trials with standardized extracts of relevant aller- gens in atopic dermatitis are needed before this form of therapy can be recommended. Treatment of atopic dermatitis with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and omali- zumab is currently investigational. Although disturbances in the metabolism of essential fatty acids have been reported in patients with atopic dermatitis, controlled trials with fish oil and evening primrose have shown no clinical benefit.  Prognosis Although it has been held that most children outgrow atopic dermatitis by adolescence, recent studies present less opti- mistic outcomes. In one study, atopic dermatitis had disap- peared in only 18% of children followed from infancy until age 13 years, although the symptoms had become less severe in 65%. In a prospective study from Finland, 77–91% of adolescent patients receiving treatment for moderate or severe atopic dermatitis had persistent or frequently relaps- ing dermatitis as adults, although only 6% had severe dis- ease. More than half of adolescents receiving treatment for mild dermatitis experienced a relapse of disease as adults. Adults whose childhood atopic dermatitis has been in remis- sion for a number of years may present with hand dermatitis, especially if daily activities require repeated hand wetting.

1063,Urticaria & Angioedema,Immunodeficiency ,3663,"URTICARIA & ANGIOEDEMA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Urticaria: erythematous, blanchable, circumscribed, pru- ritic, edematous papules ranging from 1–2 mm to several centimeters in diameter and involving the superficial dermis. Individual lesions can coalesce.  Angioedema: edema extending into the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissues.  Both resolve without sequelae—urticaria usually within hours (individual lesions rarely lasting up to 24 hours), angioedema within 72 hours.  General Considerations Urticaria and angioedema are common dermatologic condi- tions, occurring at some time in up to 25% of the popula- tion. About half of patients will have concomitant urticaria and angioedema, whereas 40% will have only urticaria and 10% only angioedema. Urticarial lesions are arbitrarily des- ignated as acute, lasting less than 6 weeks, or chronic, lasting more than 6 weeks. Acute versus chronic urticaria can also be distinguished by differences in histologic features. A history of atopy is common with acute urticaria or angioedema. In contrast, atopy does not appear to be a factor in chronic urticaria. Mast cell degranulation, dilated venules, and dermal edema are present in most forms of urticaria or angioedema. The dermal inflammatory cells may be sparse or dense depending on the chronicity of the lesions. Mast cells are thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of urticaria or angioedema through release of a variety of vasoactive mediators. Mast cell activation and degranulation can be triggered by different stimuli, including cross-linking of Fc receptor-bound IgE by allergens or anti-FcεRI antibodies. Non–IgE-mediated mechanisms have also been identified, including complement anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a), radio- contrast dyes, and physical stimuli. Chronic urticarial lesions   CHAPTER 36 1046 "
1068,Adverse Reactions to Drugs & Biologicals,Immunodeficiency ,18,"ADVERSE REACTIONS TO  DRUGS & BIOLOGICALS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Most adverse drug reactions are not allergic although patients or caregivers often report them as a drug allergy.  Antibiotics constitute the most frequent cause of aller- gic drug reactions.  Reliable testing for most drugs other than penicillins and a few large protein molecules is not available. The majority of adverse drug reactions are not immunologi- cally mediated and may be due to idiosyncratic reactions, overdosage, pharmacologic side effects, nonspecific release of pharmacologic effector molecules, or drug interactions. Patients or caregivers often describe an adverse drug reaction as being allergic in nature, and clinicians may docu- ment a drug allergy in the patient’s medical record based solely on this history. Adverse drug reactions are any undesir- able and unintended response elicited by a drug. Allergic or hypersensitivity drug reactions are adverse reactions involv- ing immune mechanisms. Although hypersensitivity reac- tions account for only 5–10% of all adverse drug reactions, they are the most serious, with 1:10,000 resulting in death. 1. Antibiotics Antibiotics constitute the most frequent cause of allergic drug reactions. Amoxicillin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxa- zole, and ampicillin are the most common causes of cutane- ous drug reactions. Most antibiotics and their metabolites are low-molecu- lar-weight compounds that do not stimulate immunity until they have become covalently bound to a carrier protein. The penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics, including cepha- losporins, carbacephems, carbapenems, and monobactams, share a common β-lactam ring structure and a marked propensity to couple to carrier proteins. Penicilloyl is the predominant metabolite of penicillin and is called the major determinant. The other penicillin metabolites are present in low concentrations and are referred to as minor determi- nants. Sulfonamide reactions are mediated presumably by a reactive metabolite (hydroxylamine) produced by cyto- chrome P-450 oxidative metabolism. Slow acetylators appear to be at increased risk. Other risk factors for drug reactions include previous exposure, previous reaction, age (20–49 years), route (parenteral), and dose of administration (high, intermittent). Atopy does not predispose to development of a reaction, but atopic individuals have more severe reactions. Immunopathologic reactions to antibiotics include type I (IgE-mediated) reactions resulting from a drug or metabo- lite interaction with preformed specific IgE bound to the surfaces of tissue mast cells or circulating basophils. Release of mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes contributes to the clinical development of angioedema, urticaria, bron- chospasm, or anaphylaxis. Type II (cytotoxic) reactions involve IgG or IgM antibodies that recognize drug bound to cell membranes. In the presence of serum complement, the antibody-coated cell is either cleared or destroyed, causing drug-induced hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia. Type III (immune complex) reactions are caused by soluble com- plexes of drug or metabolite with IgG or IgM antibody. If the immune complex is deposited on blood vessel walls and activates the complement cascade, serum sickness may result. Type IV (T-cell–mediated) reactions require activated T lymphocytes that recognize a drug or its metabolite as seen in allergic contact dermatitis. Sensitization usually occurs via the topical route of administration. Immunopathologic reac- tions not fitting into the type I–IV classification include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, and the maculopapular rash associated with penicillin or ampicillin. The prevalence of morbilliform rashes in patients given ampicillin is between 5.2% and 9.5% of treatment courses. However, patients given ampicillin during Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections or with acute lympho- blastic anemia have a 69–100% incidence of non-IgE-medi- ated rash. Serum sickness–like reactions resemble type III reactions, although immune complexes are not documented; β-lactams, especially cefaclor, and sulfonamides, have been implicated most often. They may result from an inherited propensity for hepatic biotransformation of drug into toxic or immunogenic metabolites. The incidence of “allergic” cutaneous reactions to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole in patients with AIDS has been reported to be as high as 70%. The mechanism is thought to relate to the severe immune dysregulation, although it may be due to glutathione defi- ciency resulting in toxic metabolites.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Allergic reactions can result in pruritus, urticaria, angio- edema, or anaphylaxis. Serum sickness is characterized by fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, and arthralgias. Cytotoxic drug reactions can result in symptoms and signs associated with the underlying anemia or thrombocytopenia. Delayed-type hypersensitivity may cause contact dermatitis. B. Laboratory Findings Skin testing is the most rapid, useful, and sensitive method of demonstrating the presence of IgE antibody to a specific allergen. Skin testing to nonpenicillin antibiotics may be difficult, however, because many immunologic reactions are due to metabolites rather than to the parent drug and because the relevant metabolites for most drugs other than penicillin have not been identified.

1072,Food Allergy,Immunodeficiency ,1083,"FOOD ALLERGY ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Temporal relationship between ingestion of a sus- pected food and onset of allergic symptoms.  For IgE-mediated reactions, positive prick skin test or in-vitro test to a suspected food allergen confirmed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (except in cases of anaphylaxis).  General Considerations Food allergy, defined as an adverse immune response to food proteins, affects 6% of young children and 3–4% of adults. The most common IgE-associated food allergens in children are egg (1.3%), milk (2.5%), peanut (0.8%), soy (0.4%), wheat (0.4%), tree nuts (0.2%), fish (0.2%), and shellfish (0.1%). In older patients, fish (0.4%), shellfish (2%), peanut (0.6%) and tree nuts (0.5%) are most often involved in allergic reactions, and may be lifelong allergies. The highest prevalence of food allergy is found in children with moder- ate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, with approximately 35% affected, whereas chronic conditions such as urticaria and asthma are much less likely due solely to food allergy. Of note, food allergy can be caused by non-IgE (cell)–mediated mechanisms, in conditions such as food-protein–induced enterocolitis or proctocolitis. It can also be caused by mixed IgE- and cell-mediated mechanisms, as in allergic eosino- philic esophagitis and gastroenteritis. Some adverse reactions diagnosed by patients or physi- cians as food allergy involve pharmacologic or metabolic mechanisms and reactions to food toxins. Foods containing significant amounts of vasoactive amines such as chocolate, cheese, and some wines and beers may precipitate migraine headaches in some patients. Claims that dyes, sugar, and food additives may contribute to hyperactivity in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are controver- sial. In the occasional case in which a child appears to benefit from a restricted diet, there is no evidence for an IgE- mediated etiology. Anaphylactoid reactions can occur after ingestion of foods such as certain fish containing high amounts of histamine.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Most reactions to foods occur minutes to 2 hours after ingestion. A history of a temporal relationship between the ingestion of a suspected food and onset of a reaction—as well as the nature and duration of symptoms observed—is important in establishing the diagnosis of food allergy. With chronic atopic dermatitis or persistent urticaria, the associa- tion with food may be less obvious (see earlier sections on Atopic Dermatitis and Urticaria). At times, acute symptoms may occur, but the cause may not be obvious because of hidden food allergens. A symptom diary kept for 7–14 days may be helpful in establishing an association between inges- tion of foods and symptoms and also provides a baseline observation for the pattern of symptom expression. It is important to record both the form in which the food was ingested and the foods ingested concurrently. Hives, flushing, facial angioedema, and mouth or throat itching are common. In severe cases, angioedema of the tongue, uvula, pharynx, or upper airway can occur. Contact urticaria can occur without systemic symptoms in some chil- dren. Gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal discom- fort or pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Children with food allergy may occasionally have isolated rhinoconjunctivi- tis or wheezing. Rarely, anaphylaxis to food may involve only cardiovascular collapse (see section on Anaphylaxis). B. Laboratory Findings Typically, fewer than 50% of histories of food allergy will be confirmed by blinded challenge (although this percentage is much higher in food-induced anaphylaxis). Prick skin test- ing is useful to rule out a suspected food allergen, because the predictive value is high for a properly performed negative test with an extract of good quality (negative predictive accuracy of greater than 95%). In contrast, the predictive value for a positive test is approximately 50%. RAST and other in-vitro tests have lower specificity and positive predic- tive values. In contrast, specific IgE levels to milk, egg, peanut, and fish proteins have been established with the Phadia ImmunoCAP assay correlating with a greater than 95% chance of a clinical reaction. Measurement of IgG to foods is not clinically useful as IgG responses are a reflection of normal immune recognition of foreign food proteins.   1053 37 Antimicrobial Therapy John W. Ogle, MD "
1075,Principles of Antimicrobial Therapy,Immunodeficiency ,49,"PRINCIPLES OF ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY Antimicrobial therapy of infections is arguably the most important scientific development of 20th-century medicine. It contributes significantly to the quality of life of many people and reduces the morbidity and mortality due to infectious disease. The remarkable success of antimicrobial therapy has been achieved with comparatively little toxicity and expense. The relative ease of administration and the widespread availability of these drugs have led many to adopt a philosophy of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial ther- apy for many common infections. Unfortunately this era of cheap, safe, and reliable therapy may be coming to a close owing to the increasing frequency of antimicrobial resistance in previously susceptible micro- organisms. The problem of antimicrobial resistance is cer- tainly not new—resistance was recognized for sulfonamides and penicillins shortly after their introduction. What is new is the worldwide dissemination of resistant clones of micro- organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylo- coccus aureus, which are inherently virulent and commonly cause serious infections, not only among hospitalized patients but also among outpatients. Until recently the recognition of new resistant clones was balanced by the promise of newer and more potent antimi- crobial agents. Today, because fewer new agents are under development, clinicians are beginning to encounter limita- tions in their ability to treat some serious bacterial infections. Many factors contribute to the selection of resistant clones. Our success in treating chronic diseases and immune-com- promising conditions, which has resulted in additional years of life for patients, has increased opportunities for selection of resistant strains in inpatient units and chronic care facili- ties. Overuse of antimicrobial agents also contributes to the selection of resistant strains. Examples include medications for mildly ill patients with self-limited conditions such as viral infections, and administration of broad-spectrum anti- microbials for patients whose conditions can be treated with narrow-spectrum agents. Similarly, failure to document infection with cultures obtained prior to starting therapy limits our willingness to stop or narrow the spectrum of antimicrobials. Insufficient research has been conducted to determine the optimal duration of therapy, with the result that we probably often treat longer than is necessary. Pro- phylactic strategies, as used for prevention of recurrent otitis media or urinary tract infection, create a selection pressure for antibiotic resistance. The decision-making process for choosing an appropri- ate antimicrobial agent is summarized in Table 37–1. Accu- rate clinical diagnosis is based on the history, physical examination, and initial laboratory tests. The clinical diagno- sis then leads to a consideration of the organisms most commonly associated with the clinical condition, the usual pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms, and past experience with successful treatment regimens. Cultures should be obtained in potentially serious infec- tions. Empiric antimicrobial therapy may be initiated, then modified according to the patient’s response and the culture results. Often several equally safe and efficacious antimicrobials are available. In this circumstance, the relative cost and ease of administration of the different choices should be considered. Other important considerations include the patient’s age, immune status, and exposure history. Neonates and young infants may present with nonspecific signs of infection, making the differentiation of serious disease from mild illness difficult. In older children, clinical diagnosis is more precise, which may permit therapy to be avoided or allow use of a narrower-spectrum antibiotic. Immune deficiency may increase the number and types of potential infecting organ- isms that need to be considered, including organisms that are usually avirulent but may cause infections that are serious and difficult to treat. An abnormal immune response may also diminish the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms of infection and thus lead to underestimation of the severity of illness. The exposure history may suggest the greater likelihood of certain types of infecting organisms. Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Final important considerations are the pace and serious- ness of the illness. A rapidly progressive and severe illness should be treated initially with broad-spectrum antimicrobi- als until a specific etiologic diagnosis is made. A mildly ill outpatient should receive treatment preferentially with nar- row-spectrum antimicrobials. "
1076,Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing,Immunodeficiency ,530,"Antimicrobial susceptibility, antimicrobial families, and dosing recommendations are listed in Tables 37–2 to 37–6. ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING Cultures and other diagnostic material must be obtained prior to initiating antimicrobial therapy—especially when the patient has a serious infection, initial attempts at therapy have failed, or multiagent therapy is anticipated. Whenever cultures identify the causative organism, therapy can be narrowed or optimized according to susceptibility results. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be done in a laboratory using carefully defined procedures (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). There are several ways to test antimicrobial susceptibility. Identification of an antibiotic-destroying enzyme (eg, β- lactamase) implies resistance to β-lactam–containing anti- microbial agents. Tube or microtiter broth dilution tech- niques can be used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic, which is the amount of antibiotic (in mcg/mL) necessary to inhibit the organism under specific laboratory conditions. Disk susceptibility test- ing (also performed under carefully controlled conditions) yields similar results. The E-test is a standardized test for some organisms that correlates well with MICs. Clinical laboratories usually define antimicrobial susceptibility (sus- ceptible, intermediate, and resistant) in relation to levels of the test antibiotic achievable in the blood or another body fluid (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] or urine). Organisms are usually considered susceptible to an anti- biotic if the MIC of the antibiotic for the organism is significantly lower than levels of that agent achieved in the blood using appropriate parenteral dosages. This assump- tion of susceptibility should be reconsidered whenever the patient has a focus of infection (eg, meningitis, osteomyelitis, or abscess) in which poor antibiotic penetration might occur, because the levels of antibiotic in such areas might be lower than the MIC. Conversely, although certain organisms may be reported to be resistant to an antibiotic because sufficiently high blood concentrations cannot be achieved, urine concentrations may be much higher. If so, a urinary tract infection might respond to an antibiotic that would not be adequate for treatment of septicemia. Thus, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, although a very important part of therapeutic decision making, reflects assumptions that the clinician must understand, especially for serious infections. Ultimately the true test of the efficacy of therapy is patient response. Patients who do not respond to seemingly appropriate therapy may require reassessment, including reconsidering the diagnosis, reculturing, and repeat susceptibility testing, to determine whether resistant strains have evolved or superinfection with a resistant organ- ism is present. Antimicrobial therapy cannot be expected to cure some infections unless additional supportive treatment (usually surgical) is undertaken. ALTERATION OF DOSE &  MEASUREMENT OF BLOOD LEVELS Certain antimicrobial agents have not been approved (and often not tested) for use in newborns. For those that have been approved, it is important to recognize that both dose and frequency of administration may need to be altered (see Tables 37–4 and 37–5), especially in young (7 days or younger) or low-birth-weight neonates (≤ 2000 g). Antimicrobial agents are excreted or metabolized through various physiologic mechanisms (eg, renal, hepatic). It is important to consider these routes of excretion and alter the antimicrobial dosage appropriately in any patient with some degree of organ dysfunction. (See Chapter 43.) As indicated in Table 37–4, an assessment of renal or hepatic Table 37–1. Steps in decision making  for use of antimicrobial agents.

A high level of suspicion regard- ing adverse clinical events should be maintained. THE USE OF NEW ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS New antibiotics are introduced frequently, often with claims about unique features that distinguish these usually more expensive products from existing compounds. Often these drugs share many properties with existing drugs. The role that any new antimicrobial will play can only be determined over time, during which new or previously unrecognized side effects might be described and the clinical efficacy established. Clinical trials may not be confirmed in the larger number of patients subsequently treated in practice. Because this may take many years, a conservative approach to using new antibiotics seems fitting, especially because their costs are often higher, and appropriate antimicrobial choices for most common infections already exist. It is appropriate to ask if a new antimicrobial has been proved to be as effective as (or more effective than) the current drug of choice, and whether its side effects are comparable (or less common) and its cost reasonable. The withdrawal of moxalactam and caution regarding use of trovafloxacin due to unexpected serious side effects, which were not anticipated despite extensive premar- ket testing, highlight the caution necessary before using new antimicrobials. The heavy marketing of new cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, which are very similar to existing drugs, is typical of the difficulty in evaluating antimicrobials. The development of new antibiotics is important as a response to the emergence of resistant organisms and for treatment of infections that are clinically difficult to treat (eg, viruses, fungi, and some resistant bacteria). Fortunately these infections are either rare or (usually) self-limited in immu- nocompetent hosts.

1093,Viral Infections,Immunodeficiency ,82,"VIRAL INFECTIONS Viruses cause most pediatric infections. Mixed viral or viral- bacterial infections of the respiratory and intestinal tracts are rather common, as is prolonged asymptomatic shedding of some viruses in childhood. Thus the detection of a virus is not always proof that it is the cause of a given illness. Viruses are often a predisposing factor for bacterial respiratory infections (eg, otitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia). Many respiratory and herpes viruses can now be detected within 24–48 hours by combining culture and monoclonal antibody techniques (“rapid culture technique”). Diagnosis of many viral illnesses is also possible through antigen or nucleic acid detection techniques. These techniques are more rapid than isolation of viruses in tissue culture and in most cases are equally sensitive or more so. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of viral genes has led to recog- nition of previously undetected infections. New diagnostic tests have changed some basic concepts about viral diseases and made diagnosis of viral infections both more certain and more complex. Only laboratories with excellent quality- control procedures should be used, and the results of new tests must be interpreted cautiously. The availability of specific antiviral agents increases the value of early diagnosis for some serious viral infections. Table 38–1 lists viral agents associated with common clinical signs, and Table 38–2 lists diagnostic tests. The viral diagnostic laboratory should be contacted for details regarding specimen collection, han- dling, and shipping. Table 38–3 lists common causes of red rashes in children that should be considered in the differen- tial diagnosis of certain viral illnesses. RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS Many viral infections cause upper or lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. Those that produce a predominance of these signs and symptoms are described in the text that follows. Many so-called respiratory viruses can also produce distinct nonrespiratory disease (eg, enteritis or cystitis caused by adenoviruses; parotitis caused by parainfluenza viruses). Respiratory viruses can cause disease in any area of the respiratory tree. Thus they can cause coryza, pharyngitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumo- nia—although certain viruses tend to be closely associated with one anatomic area (eg, parainfluenza with croup, respi- ratory syncytial virus [RSV] with bronchiolitis) or discrete epidemics (eg, influenza, RSV, parainfluenza). Nevertheless it is impossible on clinical grounds to be certain of the viral cause of an infection in a given child. This information is provided by the virology laboratory and is often important for epidemiologic, therapeutic, and preventive reasons. In immunocompromised patients these annoying, but other- wise benign, viruses can cause severe pneumonia. VIRUSES CAUSING THE COMMON COLD The common cold syndrome (also called upper respiratory infection) is characterized by combinations of runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, tearing, cough, and sneezing. Low-grade fever may be present. The causal agent is usually not sought or determined. Epidemiologic studies indicate that rhinoviruses, which are the most common cause (30– 40%), are present throughout the year but are more prevalent in the colder months in temperate climates. Adenoviruses also cause colds in all seasons, but epidemics are common. Respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza, and influenza viruses cause the cold syndrome during epidemics from late fall through winter. Coronaviruses, including the recently identi- fied strains NL63 and HKU1, account for 5–10% of colds in winter. Equally prevalent are other newly identified respira- tory viruses such as the human bocavirus, a parvovirus, and the KI polyomavirus. Enteroviruses cause the “summer cold.” One outcome of these infections is morbidity continuing for 5–7 days.

During and following a cold the bacterial flora change, and bacteria are found in normally sterile areas of the upper airway. Asthma attacks are frequently provoked by viruses that cause the common cold. There is no evidence that antibiotics will prevent these com- plications, and the unjustified widespread use of antibiotics for cold symptoms has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant respiratory flora. In 5–10% of children, symptoms from these virus infec- tions persist for more than 10 days. This overlap with the symptoms of bacterial sinusitis presents a difficult problem for clinicians, especially because colds can produce an abnormal computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses. Viruses that cause a minor illness in immunocompetent children, such as rhinoviruses, can cause severe lower respiratory disease in immunologically or anatomically compromised children. There is no evidence that symptomatic relief for children can be achieved with oral antihistamines, decongestants, or cough suppressants. Topical decongestants provide tempo- rary improvement in nasal symptoms. Zinc and vitamin C have not been shown to have a significant preventative or therapeutic role.

Tonsillitis may be exudative. Rhinitis and an "
1099,Influenza,Endocrine Disorders ,228,"influenza-like systemic illness may be present. Laryngotracheitis or bronchitis may accompany pharyngitis. B. Pharyngoconjunctival Fever Conjunctivitis may occur alone and be prolonged, but most often is associated with preauricular adenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, and cervical adenopathy. Foreign body sensa- tion and other symptoms last less than a week. Lower respiratory symptoms are uncommon. C. Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis Symptoms are severe conjunctivitis with punctate keratitis and occasionally visual impairment. A foreign body sensa- tion, photophobia, and swelling of conjunctiva and eyelids are characteristic. Preauricular adenopathy and subconjunc- tival hemorrhage are common. D. Pneumonia Severe pneumonia may occur at all ages. It is especially common in young children (younger than age 3 years). Chest radiographs show bilateral peribronchial and patchy ground-glass interstitial infiltrates in the lower lobes. Symp- toms persist for 2–4 weeks. Adenoviral pneumonia can be necrotizing and cause permanent lung damage, especially bronchiectasis. A pertussis-like syndrome with typical cough and lymphocytosis can occur with lower respiratory tract infection. A new variant of adenovirus serotype 14, which appeared in 2006 in the United States, can cause unusually severe, sometimes fatal pneumonia in children and adults. E. Rash A diffuse morbilliform (rarely petechial) rash resembling mea- sles, rubella, or roseola may be present. Koplik spots are absent. F. Diarrhea Enteric adenoviruses (types 40 and 41) cause 3–5% of cases of short-lived diarrhea in afebrile children. G. Mesenteric Lymphadenitis Fever and abdominal pain may mimic appendicitis. Pharyn- gitis is often associated. Adenovirus-induced adenopathy may be a factor in appendicitis and intussusception. H. Other Syndromes Immunosuppressed patients, including neonates, may de- velop severe or fatal pulmonary or gastrointestinal infections or multisystem disease. Other rare complications include encephalitis, hepatitis, and myocarditis. Adenoviruses have been implicated in the syndrome of idiopathic myocardiop- athy. Hemorrhagic cystitis can be a serious problem in immunocompromised children.  Laboratory & Diagnostic Studies Diagnosis is by culture of conjunctival, respiratory, or stool specimens. Several days to weeks are required for growth in conventional cultures. Viral culture using the rapid culture technique with immunodiagnostic reagents detects virus in 48 hours. Adenovirus infection can also be diagnosed using these reagents directly on respiratory secretions. This is quicker but less sensitive than the culture methods. PCR is an important, relatively rapid diagnostic method for adenovirus infections. Special cells are needed to isolate enteric adenoviruses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests rapidly detect enteric adenoviruses in diarrheal specimens. Respiratory adenovi- rus infections can be detected retrospectively by compar- ing acute and convalescent sera, but this is not helpful during an acute illness.  Treatment There is no specific treatment for adenovirus infections. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may be tried in immu- nocompromised patients with severe pneumonia. There are anecdotal reports of successful treatment of immunocom- promised patients with ribavirin or cidofovir, but only cidof- ovir inhibits adenovirus in vitro. Castro-Rodriguez JA et al.

Antivirals are of some benefit in immunocompetent hosts if begun within 48 hours after symptom onset. Studies in lung transplant patients indicate that oseltamivir might be useful for treatment of influenza in this immunocompro- mised population.  Recovery is usually complete unless severe cardiopulmo- nary or neurologic damage has occurred. Fatal cases occur in immunodeficient and anatomically compromised children. Effective treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in chil- dren markedly reduces the incidence of acute otitis media and antibiotic usage during the flu season.

Parainfluenza viruses (types 1–4) are the most important cause of croup. Most infants are infected with type 3 within the first 3 years of life, often in the first year. Infection with types 1 and 2 is experienced gradually over the first 5 years of life. Types 1 and 2 occur in the fall; type 3 appears annually, with a peak in the spring or summer. Most primary infec- tions are symptomatic and frequently involve the lower respiratory tract.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Clinical diseases include febrile upper respiratory infection (especially in older children with re-exposure), laryngitis, tracheobronchitis, croup, and bronchiolitis (second most common cause after RSV). The relative incidence of these manifestations is type-specific. Parainfluenza viruses (espe- cially type 1) cause 65% of cases of croup in young children, 25% of tracheobronchitis, and 50% of laryngitis. Types 1 and 2 are more likely to cause bronchiolitis. Pneumonia occurs in infants and immunodeficient children, and it leads to partic- ularly high mortality among stem cell recipients. Onset is acute. Most children are febrile. Symptoms of upper respira- tory tract infection often accompany croup. B. Laboratory Findings Diagnosis is often based on clinical findings. These viruses can be identified by conventional or rapid culture techniques (48 hours), by direct immunofluorescence on nasopharyn- geal epithelial cells in respiratory secretions (< 3 hours), or by PCR (< 48 hours).  Differential Diagnosis Parainfluenza-induced respiratory syndromes are difficult to distinguish from those caused by other respiratory viruses. Croup must be distinguished from epiglottitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae (abrupt onset, toxicity, drooling, dyspnea, little cough, left shift of blood smear, and a history of inadequate immunization).  Treatment No specific therapy or vaccine is available.

Antivirals are of some benefit in immunocompetent hosts if begun within 48 hours after symptom onset. Studies in lung transplant patients indicate that oseltamivir might be useful for treatment of influenza in this immunocompro- mised population.  Recovery is usually complete unless severe cardiopulmo- nary or neurologic damage has occurred. Fatal cases occur in immunodeficient and anatomically compromised children. Effective treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in chil- dren markedly reduces the incidence of acute otitis media and antibiotic usage during the flu season.

Ribavirin is the only licensed antiviral therapy used for RSV infection. It is given by continuous aerosolization. There is great controversy about its efficacy, and its use is infrequent in infants without significant anatomic or immu- nologic defects. At best, there is a very modest effect on disease severity in immunocompetent infants with no underlying anatomic abnormality. Even in high-risk infants, clinical response to ribavirin therapy was not demonstrated in several studies. Nevertheless, ribavirin is sometimes used in severely ill children who are immunologically or anatom- ically compromised, in those with severe cardiac disease, and in those with evidence of severe RSV infection.  Monthly intramuscular administration of humanized RSV monoclonal antibody is now recommended to prevent severe disease in high-risk patients during epidemic periods. Monthly administration should be considered during the RSV season for high-risk children, as described in Chapter 9. Use of passive immunization for immunocompromised children is logical, but not established. RSV antibody is not effective for treatment of established infection.  Prognosis Although mild bronchiolitis does not produce long-term problems, 30–40% of patients hospitalized with this infection will wheeze later in childhood, and RSV infection in infancy may be one important precursor to asthma.

1103,Human Metapneumovirus,Endocrine Disorders ,2077,"HUMAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS INFECTION ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Cough, coryza, sore throat.  Bronchiolitis.  Detection of viral antigens or nucleic acid in respiratory secretions.  General Considerations After its discovery in 2001, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was identified as a common agent of respiratory tract infections that is very similar to RSV in epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. Like RSV, parainfluenza, mumps, and measles, hMPV belongs to the paramyxovirus family. Humans are its only known reservoir. Seroepidemiologic surveys indicate that the virus has worldwide distribution. More than 90% of children contract hMPV infection by age 5 years, typically during late autumn through early spring outbreaks. hMPV accounts for 15–25% of the cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 2 years of age. Older children and adults can also develop symptomatic infection.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The most common symptoms are fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and sore throat. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia occur in 40– 70% of the children who acquire hMPV before the age of 2 years. Asymptomatic infection is uncommon. Other mani- festations include otitis, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and myal- gia. Acute wheezing has been associated with hMPV in children of all ages, raising the possibility that this virus, like RSV, might trigger reactive airway disease. Dual infection with hMPV and RSV or other respiratory viruses seems to be a common occurrence and may increase morbidity and mortality. B. Laboratory Findings The virus has very selective tissue culture tropism, which accounts for its late discovery in spite of its presence in archived specimens from the mid-1900s. The preferred method of diagnosis is PCR performed on respiratory speci- mens. Rapid shell vial culture is an acceptable, albeit less sensitive, alternative. Antibody tests are available, but are most appropriately used for epidemiologic studies.  C. Imaging Lower respiratory tract infection frequently shows hyperin- flation and patchy pneumonitis on chest radiographs.  Treatment & Prognosis No antiviral therapies are available to treat hMPV. Children with lower respiratory tract disease may require hospitaliza- tion and ventilatory support, but less frequently than with RSV-associated bronchiolitis. Duration of hospitalization in hMPV is typically shorter than in RSV.

1104,Enteroviruses,Endocrine Disorders ,36,"ENTEROVIRUSES ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Acute febrile illness with headache and sore throat.  Summer–fall epidemics.  Other common features: rash, nonexudative pharyngitis.  Common cause of aseptic meningitis.  Complications: myocarditis, neurologic damage, life- threatening illness in newborns. Enteroviruses are a major cause of illness in young children. The multiple types are physically and biochemically similar and may produce identical syndromes. The multiplicity of types makes vaccine development impractical and has hin- dered development of antigen detection and serologic tests. However, common RNA sequences and group antigens have led to diagnostic tests for viral nucleic acid and proteins. A PCR assay is available in many medical centers, but tissue culture is still used in some centers as a diagnostic method for echoviruses, polioviruses, and coxsackie B viruses. Although cultures may turn positive in 2–4 days, the rela- tively rapid answer obtained with PCR facilitates clinical decisions, particularly in cases of meningoencephalitis and severe unexplained illness in neonates.  Transmission is fecal-oral or from upper respiratory secretions. Multiple enteroviruses circulate in the commu- nity at any one time; summer–fall outbreaks are common in temperate climates, but infections are seen year-round. After poliovirus, coxsackie B virus is most virulent, followed by echovirus. Neurologic, cardiac, and overwhelming neonatal infections are the most severe forms of illness. ACUTE FEBRILE ILLNESS Accompanied by nonspecific upper respiratory or enteric symptoms, sudden onset of fever and irritability in infants or young children is often enteroviral in origin, especially in late summer and fall. More than 90% of enteroviral infections are not distinctive. Occasionally a petechial rash is seen; more often a diffuse maculopapular or morbilliform erup- tion (often prominent on palms and soles) occurs on the second to fourth day of fever. Rapid recovery is the rule. More than one febrile enteroviral illness can occur in the same patient in one season. The leukocyte count is usually normal. Infants, because of fever and irritability, may undergo an evaluation for bacteremia or meningitis and be hospitalized to rule out sepsis. Approximately half of these infants have aseptic meningitis. In the summer months enterovirus infection is more likely than human herpesvirus 6 to cause an acute medical visit for fever. Duration of illness is 4–5 days.

Febrile Illness with Pharyngitis This syndrome is most common in older children, who complain of headache, sore throat, myalgia, and abdominal discomfort. The usual duration is 3–4 days. Vesicles or papules may be seen in the pharynx. There is no exudate. Occasionally, enteroviruses are the cause of croup, bronchi- tis, or pneumonia. They may also exacerbate asthma. 2. Herpangina Herpangina is characterized by an acute onset of fever and posterior pharyngeal grayish white vesicles that quickly form ulcers (< 20 in number), often linearly arranged on the posterior palate, uvula, and tonsillar pillars. Bilateral faucial ulcers may also be seen. Dysphagia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia also occur and, rarely, parotitis or vaginal ulcers. Symptoms disappear in 4–5 days. The epidemic form is due to a variety of coxsackie A viruses; coxsackie B viruses and echoviruses cause sporadic cases. The differential diagnosis includes primary herpes sim- plex gingivostomatitis (ulcers are more prominent anteri- orly, and gingivitis is present), aphthous stomatitis (fever absent, recurrent episodes, anterior lesions), trauma, hand- foot-and-mouth disease (see later discussion), and Vincent angina (painful gingivitis spreading from the gum line, underlying dental disease). If the enanthema is missed, tonsillitis might be incorrectly diagnosed. 3. Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis Coxsackievirus A10 has been associated with a febrile phar- yngitis characterized by nonulcerative yellow-white poste- rior pharyngeal papules in the same distribution as herpan- gina. The duration is 1–2 weeks; therapy is supportive. 4. Pleurodynia (Bornholm  Disease, Epidemic Myalgia) Caused by coxsackie B virus (epidemic form) or many nonpolio enteroviruses (sporadic form), pleurodynia is asso- ciated with an abrupt onset of unilateral or bilateral spas- modic pain of variable intensity over the lower ribs or upper abdomen. Associated symptoms include headache, fever, vomiting, myalgias, and abdominal and neck pain. Physical findings include fever, chest muscle tenderness, decreased thoracic excursion, and occasionally a friction rub. The chest radiograph is normal. Hematologic tests are nondiagnostic.

1105,Rashes,Diabetes Mellitus ,465,"RASHES (INCLUDING  HAND-FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE) The rash may be macular, maculopapular, urticarial, scarla- tiniform, petechial, or vesicular. One of the most characteris- tic is that of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (caused by cox- sackieviruses, especially types A5, A10, and A16), in which vesicles or red papules are found on the tongue, oral mucosa, hands, and feet. Often they appear near the nails and on the heels. Associated fever, sore throat, and malaise are mild. The rash may appear when fever abates, simulating roseola. 1. Cardiac Involvement Myocarditis and pericarditis may be caused by a number of nonpolio enteroviruses, particularly type B coxsackieviruses. Most commonly, upper respiratory symptoms are followed by substernal pain, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance. A friction rub or gallop may be detected. Ultrasound will define ventricular dysfunction, and electrocardiography may show pericarditis or ventricular irritability. Creatine phosphoki- nase may be elevated. The disease may be mild or fatal; most children recover completely. In infants, other organs may be involved at the same time; in older patients, cardiac disease is usually the sole manifestation (see Chapter 19 for therapy). Enteroviral RNA is present in cardiac tissue in some cases of dilated cardiomyopathy or myocarditis; the significance of this finding is unknown. Epidemics of enterovirus 71, which occur in Asia, as well as sporadic cases in the United States, are associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary edema following typical mucocutaneous mani- festations of enterovirus infection. Enterovirus 71 also can cause isolated severe neurologic disease or neurologic disease in combination with myocardial disease. 2. Severe Neonatal Infection Sporadic and nosocomial nursery cases of severe systemic enteroviral disease occur. Clinical manifestations include com- binations of fever, rash, pneumonitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and myositis. The infants, usually younger than 1 week old, may appear septic, with cyanosis, dyspnea, and seizures. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial and herpes simplex infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, other causes of heart or liver failure, and meta- bolic diseases. Diagnosis is suggested by the finding of cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) mononuclear pleocytosis and confirmed by the isolation of virus or detection of enteroviral RNA in urine, stool, CSF, or pharynx. Therapy is supportive. IVIG is often administered, but its value is uncertain. Passively acquired maternal antibody may protect newborns from severe disease. For this reason, labor should not be induced in preg- nant women near term who have suspected enteroviral disease.

In endemic areas, most older children and adults are immune because of prior inapparent infections. Occasional cases in the United States occur in patients who travel to foreign countries. Most recent cases were in immunodefi- cient patients who received the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) or were exposed to recent vaccinees. Severe poliovi- rus infection was a rare complication of OPV vaccination as a result of reversion of the vaccine virus. The incidence of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in the United States was 1:750,000 and 1:2.4 million doses for the first and second dose of OPV, respectively. Although rare, VAPP became more common than wild-type poliomyelitis in the United States in the 1980s. This led to change in the recommended immunization regimen, substituting inacti- vated polio vaccine (IPV) for OPV (see Chapter 9).  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The initial symptoms are fever, myalgia, sore throat, and headache for 2–6 days. In less than 10% of infected children,   INFECTIONS: VIRAL & RICKETTSIAL 1083 This is a disease of muscle, but the differential diagnosis includes bacterial pneumonia, empyema, tuberculosis, and endemic fungal infections (all excluded radiographically and by auscultation), costochondritis (no fever or other symp- toms), and a variety of abdominal problems, especially those causing diaphragmatic irritation. There is no specific therapy. Potent analgesic agents and chest splinting alleviate the pain. RASHES (INCLUDING  HAND-FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE) The rash may be macular, maculopapular, urticarial, scarla- tiniform, petechial, or vesicular. One of the most characteris- tic is that of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (caused by cox- sackieviruses, especially types A5, A10, and A16), in which vesicles or red papules are found on the tongue, oral mucosa, hands, and feet. Often they appear near the nails and on the heels. Associated fever, sore throat, and malaise are mild. The rash may appear when fever abates, simulating roseola. 1. Cardiac Involvement Myocarditis and pericarditis may be caused by a number of nonpolio enteroviruses, particularly type B coxsackieviruses. Most commonly, upper respiratory symptoms are followed by substernal pain, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance. A friction rub or gallop may be detected. Ultrasound will define ventricular dysfunction, and electrocardiography may show pericarditis or ventricular irritability. Creatine phosphoki- nase may be elevated. The disease may be mild or fatal; most children recover completely. In infants, other organs may be involved at the same time; in older patients, cardiac disease is usually the sole manifestation (see Chapter 19 for therapy). Enteroviral RNA is present in cardiac tissue in some cases of dilated cardiomyopathy or myocarditis; the significance of this finding is unknown. Epidemics of enterovirus 71, which occur in Asia, as well as sporadic cases in the United States, are associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary edema following typical mucocutaneous mani- festations of enterovirus infection. Enterovirus 71 also can cause isolated severe neurologic disease or neurologic disease in combination with myocardial disease. 2. Severe Neonatal Infection Sporadic and nosocomial nursery cases of severe systemic enteroviral disease occur. Clinical manifestations include com- binations of fever, rash, pneumonitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and myositis. The infants, usually younger than 1 week old, may appear septic, with cyanosis, dyspnea, and seizures. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial and herpes simplex infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, other causes of heart or liver failure, and meta- bolic diseases. Diagnosis is suggested by the finding of cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) mononuclear pleocytosis and confirmed by the isolation of virus or detection of enteroviral RNA in urine, stool, CSF, or pharynx. Therapy is supportive. IVIG is often administered, but its value is uncertain. Passively acquired maternal antibody may protect newborns from severe disease. For this reason, labor should not be induced in preg- nant women near term who have suspected enteroviral disease.

Poliomyelitis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Inadequate immunization or underlying immune defi- ciency.  Headache, fever, muscle weakness.  Aseptic meningitis.  Asymmetrical, flaccid paralysis; muscle tenderness and hyperesthesia; intact sensation; late atrophy.  General Considerations Poliovirus infection is subclinical in 90–95% of cases; it causes nonspecific febrile illness in about 5% of cases and aseptic meningitis, with or without paralytic disease, in 1– 3%. In endemic areas, most older children and adults are immune because of prior inapparent infections. Occasional cases in the United States occur in patients who travel to foreign countries. Most recent cases were in immunodefi- cient patients who received the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) or were exposed to recent vaccinees. Severe poliovi- rus infection was a rare complication of OPV vaccination as a result of reversion of the vaccine virus. The incidence of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in the United States was 1:750,000 and 1:2.4 million doses for the first and second dose of OPV, respectively. Although rare, VAPP became more common than wild-type poliomyelitis in the United States in the 1980s. This led to change in the recommended immunization regimen, substituting inacti- vated polio vaccine (IPV) for OPV (see Chapter 9).  Clinical Findings A.

Type 1 (HSV- 1) causes most cases of oral, skin, and cerebral disease. Type 2 (HSV-2) causes most (80–85%) genital and congenital infections. Latent infection in sensory ganglia routinely fol- lows primary infection. Recurrences may be spontaneous or induced by external events (eg, fever, menstruation, or sunlight) or immunosuppression. Transmission is by direct contact with infected secretions. Herpes simplex viruses are very susceptible to antiviral drugs. Primary infection with HSV-1 often occurs early in childhood, although many adults (20–50%) have never been infected. Primary infection with HSV-1 is subclinical in 80% of cases and causes gingivostomatitis in the remainder. HSV- 2, which is transmitted sexually, is also usually (65%) sub- clinical or produces mild, nonspecific symptoms. Infection with one type of HSV may prevent or attenuate clinically apparent infection with the other type, but individuals can be infected at different times with both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Recurrent episodes are due to reactivation of latent HSV.  Clinical Findings The source of primary infection is usually an asymptomatic excreter. Most previously infected individuals shed HSV at irregular intervals. At any one time (point prevalence), more than 5% of normal seropositive adults excrete HSV-1 in the saliva; the percentage is higher in recently infected children. HSV-2 shedding in genital secretions occurs with a point prevalence exceeding 10%, depending on the method of detection (viral isolation vs PCR) and the interval since the initial infection. A history of contact with an active HSV infection is unusual. A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Gingivostomatitis—High fever, irritability, and drooling occur in infants. Multiple oral ulcers are seen on the tongue and on the buccal and gingival mucosa, occasionally extend- ing to the pharynx. Pharyngeal ulcers may predominate in older children and adolescents. Diffusely swollen red gums that are friable and bleed easily are typical. Cervical nodes are swollen and tender. Duration is 7–14 days. Herpangina, aphthous stomatitis, thrush, and Vincent angina should be excluded. 2. Vulvovaginitis or urethritis—Genital herpes (especially HSV-2) in a prepubertal child should suggest sexual abuse. Vesicles or painful ulcers on the vulva, vagina, or penis and tender adenopathy are seen. Systemic symptoms (fever, flulike illness, myalgia) are common with the initial episode. Painful urination may cause retention. Primary infections last 10–14 days before healing. Lesions may resemble trau- ma, syphilis (ulcers are painless), or chancroid (ulcers are painful and nodes are erythematous and fluctuant) in the adolescent, and bullous impetigo, trauma, and severe chem- ical irritation in younger children. 3. Cutaneous infections—Direct inoculation onto cuts or abrasions may produce localized vesicles or ulcers. A deep HSV infection on the fingers (called herpetic whitlow) may be mistaken for a bacterial felon or paronychia; surgical drainage is of no value and is contraindicated. HSV infection of eczematous skin may result in extensive areas of vesicles and shallow ulcers (eczema herpeticum), which may be mistaken for impetigo or varicella. 4. Recurrent mucocutaneous infection—Recurrent oral shedding is usually asymptomatic. Perioral recurrences often begin with a prodrome of tingling or burning limited to the vermilion border, followed by vesiculation, scabbing, and crusting around the lips over the next 3–5 days. Intraoral lesions rarely recur. Fever, adenopathy, and other symptoms are absent. Recurrent cutaneous herpes most closely resem- bles impetigo, but the latter is often outside the perinasal and perioral region, responds to antibiotics, yields a positive result on Gram stain, and Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylo- coccus aureus can be isolated. Recurrent genital disease is common after the initial infection with HSV-2. It is shorter (5–7 days) and milder (mean, four lesions) than primary infection and is not associated with systemic symptoms. 5. Keratoconjunctivitis—Keratoconjunctivitis may be part of a primary infection due to spread from infected saliva. Most cases are caused by reactivation of virus latent in the ciliary ganglion. Keratoconjunctivitis produces photopho- bia, pain, and conjunctival irritation. With recurrences, dendritic corneal ulcers may be demonstrable with fluores- cein staining. Stromal invasion may occur. Corticosteroids should never be used for unilateral keratitis without ophthal- mologic consultation.

Frequent genital recurrences may be suppressed by oral administration of nucleoside analogues, but this approach should be used sparingly. Other forms of severe cutaneous disease, such as eczema herpeticum, respond to these antivirals. Intravenous acyclovir may be required when disease is extensive in immunocompromised children (500 mg/m2 every 8 hours). Oral acyclovir, which is available in suspension, is also used within 72–96 hours for severe primary gingivosto- matitis in immunocompetent young children (10 mg/kg per dose four times a day for 5–7 days). Antiviral therapy does not alter the incidence or severity of subsequent recurrences of oral or genital infection. Development of resistance to antivirals is very rare after treating immunocompetent patients, but it is reported in immunocompromised patients who receive fre- quent and prolonged therapy. 3. Encephalitis—Treatment consists of intravenous acyclo- vir, 500 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 21 days. 4. Neonatal infection—Newborns receive intravenous acy- clovir, 20 mg/kg every 8 hours for 21 days (14 days if infection is limited to skin, eye, or mouth). B. General Measures 1. Gingivostomatitis—Gingivostomatitis is treated with pain relief and temperature control measures. Maintaining hydration is important because of the long duration of illness (7–14 days). Nonacidic, cool fluids are best. Topical anesthetic agents (eg, viscous lidocaine or an equal mixture of kaolin– attapulgite [Kaopectate], diphenhydramine, and viscous lido- caine) may be used as a mouthwash for older children who will not swallow it; ingested lidocaine may be toxic to infants or may lead to aspiration. Antiviral therapy is indicated in normal hosts with severe disease. Antibiotics are not helpful. 2. Genital infections—Genital infections require pain re- lief, assistance with voiding (warm baths, topical anesthetics, rarely catheterization), and psychological support. Lesions should be kept clean; drying may shorten the duration of symptoms. Sexual contact should be avoided during the interval from prodrome to crusting stages. Because of the frequency of asymptomatic shedding, the only effective way to prevent spread is the use of condoms. 3. Cutaneous lesions—Skin lesions should be kept clean, dry, and covered if possible to prevent spread. Systemic analgesics may be helpful. Secondary bacterial infection is uncommon in patients with lesions on the mucosa or involv- ing small areas. Secondary infection should be considered and treated if necessary (usually with an antistaphylococcal agent) in patients with more extensive lesions. Candidal superinfec- tion occurs in 10% of women with primary genital infections. 4. Recurrent cutaneous disease—Recurrent disease is usu- ally milder than primary infection. Sun block lip balm helps prevent labial recurrences after intense sun exposure. There is no evidence that the many popular topical or vitamin therapies are efficacious. 5. Keratoconjunctivitis—An ophthalmologist should be consulted regarding the use of cycloplegics, anti-inflamma- tory agents, local debridement, and other therapies. 6. Encephalitis—Extensive support will be required for obtunded or comatose patients. Rehabilitation and psycho- logical support are often needed for survivors. 7. Neonatal infection—The affected infant should be iso- lated and given acyclovir. Cesarean delivery is indicated if the mother has obvious cervical or vaginal lesions, especially if these represent primary infection (35–50% transmission rate). With infants born vaginally to mothers who have active lesions, appropriate cultures should be obtained at 24–48 hours after birth, and the infants should be observed closely. Treatment is given to infants whose culture results are positive or who have suggestive signs or symptoms. Infants born to mothers with obvious primary genital herpes should receive therapy before the culture results are known. For women with a history of genital herpes infection, but no genital lesions, vaginal delivery with peripartum cultures of maternal cervix is the standard. Clinical follow-up of the newborn is recom- mended when maternal culture results are positive. Repeated cervical cultures during pregnancy are not useful.

1110,Varicella & Herpes Zoster,Diabetes Mellitus ,4711,"VARICELLA & HERPES ZOSTER ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Varicella (chickenpox): • Exposure to varicella or herpes zoster 10–21 days previously; no prior history of varicella. • Widely scattered red macules and papules concen- trated on the face and trunk, rapidly progressing to clear vesicles on an erythematous base, pustules, and then crusting, over 5–6 days. • Variable fever and nonspecific systemic symptoms.  Herpes zoster (shingles): • History of varicella. • Dermatomal paresthesias and pain prior to eruption (more common in older children). • Dermatomal distribution of grouped vesicles on an erythematous base.   INFECTIONS: VIRAL & RICKETTSIAL 1091  Clinical Findings The most prominent historical feature is the abrupt onset of fever, often reaching 40.6°C, which lasts up to 8 days (mean, 4 days) in an otherwise mildly ill child. The fever then ceases abruptly, and a characteristic rash may appear. Roseola occurs predominantly in children aged 6 months to 3 years, with 90% of cases occurring before the second year. HHV-7 infec- tion tends to occur somewhat later in childhood. These viruses are the most common recognized cause of exanthema- tous fever in this age group and are responsible for 20% of emergency department visits by children aged 6–12 months. A. Symptoms and Signs Mild lethargy and irritability may be present, but generally there is a dissociation between systemic symptoms and the febrile course. The pharynx, tonsils, and tympanic mem- branes may be injected. Conjunctivitis and pharyngeal exu- date are notably absent. Diarrhea and vomiting occur in one third of patients. Adenopathy of the head and neck often occurs. The anterior fontanelle is bulging in one quarter of HHV-6-infected infants. If rash appears (20–30% inci- dence), it begins on the trunk and spreads to the face, neck, and extremities. Rose-pink macules or maculopapules, 2–3 mm in diameter, are nonpruritic, tend to coalesce, and disappear in 1–2 days without pigmentation or desquama- tion. Rash may occur without fever. B. Laboratory Findings Leukopenia and lymphocytopenia are present early. Laboratory evidence of hepatitis occurs in some patients, especially adults.  Differential Diagnosis The initial high fever may require exclusion of serious bacte- rial infection. The relative well-being of most children and the typical course and rash soon clarify the diagnosis. The eryth- rocyte sedimentation rate is normal. If the child has a febrile seizure, it is important to exclude bacterial meningitis. The CSF is normal in children with roseola. In children who receive antibiotics or other medication at the beginning of the fever, the rash may be attributed incorrectly to drug allergy.  Complications & Sequelae Febrile seizures occur in 10% of patients (even higher per- centages in those with HHV-7 infections). There is evidence that HHV-6 can directly infect the central nervous system, causing meningoencephalitis or aseptic meningitis. Multior- gan disease (pneumonia, hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, encephalitis) may occur in immunocompromised patients.  Treatment & Prognosis Fever is managed readily with acetaminophen and sponge baths. Fever control should be a major consideration in children with a history of febrile seizures. Roseola infantum is otherwise entirely benign. Dyer JA: Childhood viral exanthems.

1113,Cytomegalovirus Infections,Diabetes Mellitus ,2936,"CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTIONS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Primary infection: • Asymptomatic or minor illness in young children. • Mononucleosis-like syndrome without pharyngitis in postpubertal individuals.  Congenital infection: • Intrauterine growth retardation. • Microcephaly with intracerebral calcifications and seizures. • Retinitis and encephalitis. • Hepatosplenomegaly with thrombocytopenia. • “Blueberry muffin” rash. • Sensorineural deafness.  Immunocompromised hosts: • Retinitis and encephalitis. • Pneumonitis. • Enteritis and hepatitis. • Bone marrow suppression.  General Considerations Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus transmit- ted by many routes. It can be acquired in utero following maternal viremia or postpartum from birth canal secretions or maternal milk. Young children are infected by the saliva of playmates; older individuals are infected by sexual partners (eg, from saliva, vaginal secretions, or semen). Transfused blood products and transplanted organs can be a source of CMV infection. Clinical illness is determined largely by the patient’s immune competence. Immunocompetent individuals usually develop a mild self-limited illness, whereas immunocompro- mised children can develop severe, progressive, often multior- gan disease. In-utero infection can be teratogenic. 1. In-Utero Cytomegalovirus Infection Approximately 0.5–1.5% of children are born with CMV infections acquired during maternal viremia. CMV infection is   CHAPTER 38 1094 in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), after transplantation, or with congenital immunode- ficiencies. However, in most immunocompromised patients, primary infection is more likely to cause severe symptoms than is reactivation or reinfection. The severity of the resulting disease is generally proportionate to the degree of immunosuppression.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs A mild febrile illness with myalgia, malaise, and arthralgia may occur, especially with reactivation disease. Severe dis- ease often includes subacute onset of dyspnea and cyanosis as manifestations of interstitial pneumonitis. Auscultation reveals only coarse breath sounds and scattered rales. A rapid respiratory rate may precede clinical or radiographic evi- dence of pneumonia. Hepatitis without jaundice or hepato- megaly is common. Diarrhea, which can be severe, occurs with CMV colitis, and CMV can cause esophagitis with symptoms of odynophagia or dysphagia. These enteropa- thies are most common in AIDS, as is the presence of a retinitis that often progresses to blindness. Encephalitis and polyradiculitis also occur in AIDS. B. Laboratory Findings Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are common. Atypical lymphocytosis is infrequent. Serum aminotransferase levels are often elevated. The stools may contain occult blood if enteropathy is present. CMV is readily isolated from saliva, urine, buffy coat, and bronchial secretions. Results are avail- able in 48 hours. Interpretation of positive cultures is made difficult by asymptomatic shedding of CMV in saliva and urine in many immunocompromised patients. CMV disease correlates more closely with the presence of CMV in the blood or lung lavage fluid. Monitoring for the appearance of CMV DNA in plasma or CMV antigen in blood mononu- clear cells is used as a guide to early antiviral (“preemptive”) therapy. C. Imaging Bilateral interstitial pneumonitis is present on chest radiographs.  Differential Diagnosis The initial febrile illness must be distinguished from treatable bacterial or fungal infection. Similarly the pulmonary disease must be distinguished from intrapulmonary hemorrhage; drug-induced or radiation pneumonitis; pulmonary edema; and bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and other viruses infection in this population. CMV infection is seen bilaterally and inter- stitially on chest radiographs, cough is nonproductive, chest pain is absent, and the patient is not usually toxic. Pneumo- cystis jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis carinii) infection may have a similar presentation. These patients may have polymi- crobial disease. It is suspected that bacterial and fungal infections are enhanced by the neutropenia that can accom- pany CMV infection. Infection of the gastrointestinal tract is diagnosed by endoscopy. This will exclude candidal, adeno- viral, and herpes simplex infections and allows tissue confir- mation of CMV-induced mucosal ulcerations.  Prevention & Treatment Blood donors should be screened to exclude those with prior CMV infection, or blood should be filtered. Ideally, seroneg- ative transplant recipients should receive organs from sero- negative donors. Severe symptoms, most commonly pneu- monitis, often respond to early therapy with intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg every 12 hours for 14–21 days). Neutro- penia is a frequent side effect of this therapy. Foscarnet and cidofovir are alternative therapeutic agents recommended for patients with ganciclovir-resistant virus. Prophylactic use of oral or intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet may prevent CMV infections in organ transplant recipients. A new drug with an excellent safety profile, maribavir, has shown efficacy in hematopoietic stem cell recipients. Additional studies are being conducted in solid organ transplant recipients. Pre- emptive therapy can be used in transplant recipients by monitoring CMV blood PCR and instituting therapy when the results reach a certain threshold regardless of clinical signs or symptoms. CMV-seropositive children with AIDS and low CD4 counts (< 50/μL) should have funduscopic examina- tions and plasma CMV DNA measurements every 3 months.

Children with other congenital immunodeficien- cies or chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression can also develop progressive EBV infection, EBV-associated lympho- proliferative disorder or lymphoma, and other malignancies.  Treatment & Prognosis Bed rest may be necessary in severe cases. Acetaminophen controls high fever. Potential airway obstruction due to swollen pharyngeal lymphoid tissue responds rapidly to systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may also be given for hematologic and neurologic complications, although no controlled trials have proved their efficacy in these condi- tions. Fever and pharyngitis disappear by 10–14 days. Ade- nopathy and splenomegaly can persist several weeks longer. Some patients complain of fatigue, malaise, or lack of well- being for several months. Although corticosteroids may shorten the duration of fatigue and malaise, their long-term effects on this potentially oncogenic viral infection are unknown, and indiscriminate use is discouraged. Patients with splenic enlargement should avoid contact sports for 6– 8 weeks. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir, ganciclovir, and foscarnet are active against EBV and are indicated in the treatment of chronic active EBV. Management of EBV-related lymphoproliferative disor- ders relies primarily on decreasing the immunosuppression whenever possible. Adjunctive therapy with acyclovir, ganci- clovir, or another antiviral active against EBV as well as CMV hyperimmune globulin has been used without scientific evidence of efficacy.

1118,Viral Infections Spread by Insect Vectors,Diabetes Mellitus ,1990,"VIRAL INFECTIONS SPREAD BY INSECT VECTORS In the United States, mosquitoes are the most common insect vectors that spread viral infections (Table 38–4). As a conse- quence, these infections—and others that are spread by ticks—tend to occur as summer–fall epidemics that coincide with the seasonal breeding and feeding habits of the vector, and the etiologic agent varies by region. Thus a careful travel and exposure history is critical for correct diagnostic workup. ENCEPHALITIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fever and headache.  Change in mental status or behavior (or both), with or without focal neurologic deficits.  CSF shows a mononuclear cell pleocytosis, elevated protein level, and normal glucose level. Encephalitis is a common severe manifestation of many infec- tions spread by insects (see Table 38–4). With many viral pathogens, the infection is most often subclinical, or mild CNS disease such as meningitis is present. These infections have some distinguishing features in terms of subclinical infection rate, unique neurologic syndromes, associated non- neurologic symptoms, and prognosis. The diagnosis is generally made clinically during recognized outbreaks and is confirmed by virus-specific serology. Prevention consists of control of mosquito vectors and precautions with proper clothing and insect repellents to minimize mosquito and tick bites. West Nile Virus Encephalitis This flavivirus is the most important arbovirus infection in the United States. Since it was described in 1999 in New York, it has spread to 47 states. In 2007, West Nile virus caused more than 3300 clinically apparent infections, more than 1000 nervous system infections, and 95 deaths. Its reservoir includes more than 160 species of birds whose migration explain the rapid growth of the epidemic. During summer–fall epidemics most infected individuals are asymp- tomatic. Approximately 20% develop West Nile fever, which is characterized by fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, nausea and vomiting, lymphadenopathy, and a maculopapular rash (20–50%). Less than 1% of infected patients develop menin- gitis or encephalitis, but 10% of these cases are fatal (0.1% of all infections). The major risk factor for severe disease is age older than 50 years and immune compromise, although children develop West Nile fever and occasionally have neurologic disease. The neurologic manifestations are most often those found with other encephalitides. However, dis- tinguishing atypical features include polio-like flaccid paral- ysis, movement disorders (parkinsonism, tremor, myoclo- nus), brainstem symptoms, polyneuropathy, and optic neuritis. Muscle weakness, facial palsy, and hyporeflexia are common (20% of each finding). Diagnosis is best made by detecting IgM antibody (EIA) to the virus in CSF. This will be present by 2–3 days (95%) after onset. PCR is a specific diagnostic tool but is less sensitive than antibody detection. Antibody rise in serum can also be used for diagnosis. Treatment is supportive, although various antivirals and specific immune globulin are being studied. The infection is not spread between contacts, but is spread by donated organs and blood and breast milk and transplacentally. The coming years will indicate if this virus will become a serious endemic problem in the United States. Truemper EJ, Romero JR: West Nile virus. Pediatr Ann 2007;36:414 [PMID: 17691625].   CHAPTER 38 1100 Colorado tick fever, a tick-borne illness, is endemic in the high plains and mountains of the central and northern Rocky Mountains and northern Pacific coast of the United States. The reservoir of the virus consists of squirrels and chipmunks. Many hundreds of cases of Colorado tick fever occur each year in visitors or laborers entering this region, primarily from May through July.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs After a 3- to 4-day incubation period (maximum, 14 days) fever begins suddenly together with chills, lethargy, head- ache, ocular pain, myalgia, abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting. Conjunctivitis may be present. A nondistinctive maculopapular rash occurs in 5–10% of patients. The illness lasts 7–10 days, and half of patients have a biphasic fever curve with several afebrile days in the midst of the illness. B. Laboratory Findings Leukopenia is characteristic early in the illness. Platelets are modestly decreased. Specific ELISA testing is available, but 3–4 weeks may elapse before seroconversion. Fluorescent antibody staining will detect virus-infected erythrocytes dur- ing the illness and for weeks after recovery.  Differential Diagnosis Early findings, especially if rash is present, may suggest enterovirus, measles, or rubella infection. Enteric fever may be an early consideration because of the presence of leukope- nia and thrombocytopenia. A history of tick bite, which is often obtained; information about local risk; and the bipha- sic fever pattern will help with the diagnosis. Because of the wilderness exposure, diseases such as leptospirosis, borrelio- sis, tularemia, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever will be considerations.  Complications Meningoencephalitis occurs in 3–7% of patients. Cardiac and pulmonary complications are rare.  Prevention & Treatment Prevention involves avoiding endemic areas and using con- ventional means to avoid tick bite. Therapy is supportive. Do not use analgesics that modify platelet function. Gunther G, Haglund M: Tick-borne encephalopathies: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. CNS Drugs 2005;19:1009-32 [PMID: 16332143].

1122,Viral Childhood Exanthems,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,2179,"VIRAL CHILDHOOD EXANTHEMS See the earlier section on Infections Due to Herpesvirus for a discussion of varicella and roseola, two other major child- hood exanthems. ERYTHEMA INFECTIOSUM ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fever and rash with “slapped-cheek” appearance, followed by a symmetrical, full-body maculopapular rash.  Arthritis in older children.  Profound anemia in patients with impaired erythrocyte production.  Nonimmune hydrops fetalis following infection of pregnant women.  General Considerations This benign exanthematous illness of school-aged children is caused by the human parvovirus designated B19. Spread is respiratory, occurring in winter–spring epidemics. A nonspe- cific mild flulike illness may occur during the initial viremia at 7–10 days; the characteristic rash occurring at 10–17 days represents an immune response. The patient is viremic and contagious prior to—but not after—the onset of rash. Approximately half of infected individuals have a sub- clinical illness. Most cases (60%) occur in children between ages 5 and 15 years, with an additional 40% occurring later in life. Forty percent of adults are seronegative. The disease is mildly contagious; the secondary attack rate in a school or household setting is 50% among susceptible children and 20–30% among susceptible adults.  Clinical Findings Owing to the nonspecific nature of the exanthem and the many subclinical cases, a history of contact with an infected individual is often absent or unreliable. Recognition of the illness is easier during outbreaks. A. Symptoms and Signs Typically the first sign of illness is the rash, which begins as raised, fiery red maculopapular lesions on the cheeks that coalesce to give a “slapped-cheek” appearance. The lesions are warm, nontender, and sometimes pruritic. They may be scattered on the forehead, chin, and postauricular areas, but the circumoral region is spared. Within 1–2 days, similar lesions appear on the proximal extensor surfaces of the extremities and spread distally in a symmetrical fashion. Palms and soles are usually spared. The trunk, neck, and buttocks are also commonly involved. Central clearing of confluent lesions produces a characteristic lacelike pattern. The rash fades in several days to several weeks but frequently reappears in response to local irritation, heat (bathing), sunlight, and stress. Nearly 50% of infected children have   CHAPTER 38 1104 and very high rubella IgM antibody titers. Total serum IgM is elevated, and IgA and IgG levels may be depressed. Virus may be isolated from throat or urine from 1 week before to 2 weeks after onset of rash. Children with congen- ital infection are infectious for months. The virus laboratory must be notified that rubella is suspected. Serologic diagno- sis is best made by demonstrating a fourfold rise in antibody titer between specimens drawn 1–2 weeks apart. The first should be drawn promptly, because titers increase rapidly after onset of rash. Both specimens must be tested simulta- neously by a single laboratory. Specific IgM antibody can be measured by immunoassay. Because the decision to termi- nate a pregnancy is usually based on serologic results, testing must be done carefully. C. Imaging Pneumonitis and bone metaphyseal longitudinal lucencies may be present in radiographs of children with congenital infection.  Differential Diagnosis Rubella may resemble infections due to enterovirus, adeno- virus, measles, EBV, roseola, parvovirus, T gondii, and Myco- plasma. Drug reactions may also mimic rubella. Because public health implications are great, sporadic suspected cases should be confirmed serologically or virologically. Congenital rubella must be differentiated from congeni- tal CMV infection, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis.  Complications & Sequelae A. Arthralgia and Arthritis Both occur more often in adult women. Polyarticular involvement (fingers, knees, wrists), lasting a few days to weeks, is typical. Frank arthritis occurs in a small percentage of patients. It may resemble acute rheumatoid arthritis. B. Encephalitis With an incidence of about 1:6000, this is a nonspecific parainfectious encephalitis associated with a low mortality rate. A syndrome resembling SSPE (see Measles section, earlier) has also been described in congenital rubella. C. Rubella in Pregnancy Infection in the mother is self-limited and not severe.  Prevention Rubella is one of the infections that could be eradicated. See Chapter 9 for the indication and efficacy of rubella vaccine. Standard prenatal care should include rubella antibody test- ing. Seropositive mothers are at no risk; seronegative moth- ers are vaccinated after delivery. A pregnant woman possibly exposed to rubella should be tested immediately; if seropositive, she is immune and need not worry. If she is seronegative, a second specimen should be drawn in 4 weeks, and both specimens should be tested simultaneously. Seroconversion in the first trimester sug- gests high fetal risk; such women require counseling regard- ing therapeutic abortion. When pregnancy termination is not an option, some experts recommend intramuscular administration of 20 mL of immune globulin within 72 hours after exposure in an attempt to prevent infection. (This negates the value of subsequent antibody testing.) The efficacy of this practice is unknown.  Treatment & Prognosis Symptomatic therapy is sufficient. Arthritis may improve with administration of anti-inflammatory agents. The prog- nosis is excellent in all children and adults but poor in congenitally infected infants, in whom most defects are irreversible or progressive. The severe cognitive defects seem to correlate closely in these infants with the degree of growth failure.

1126,Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,3562,"HANTAVIRUS CARDIOPULMONARY SYNDROME ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Influenza-like prodrome (fever, myalgia, headache, cough).  Rapid onset of unexplained pulmonary edema and myocardiopathy.  Residence or travel in endemic area; exposure to aerosols from deer mouse droppings or secretions.  General Considerations Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is the first native bunyavirus infection endemic in the United States. This syndrome is distinctly different in mode of spread (no arthropod vector) and clinical picture from other bunyavirus diseases.  Clinical Findings The initial cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome involved travel to or residence in a limited area in the southwestern United States where there was a potential for exposure to the reservoir, the deer mouse. This and many   INFECTIONS: VIRAL & RICKETTSIAL 1105 other related rodents live in many other locales, and the disease has been confirmed in more than 30 other states, with additional cases in Canada. Epidemics occur when environ- mental conditions favor large increases in the rodent popula- tion and increased prevalence of virus in this reservoir. A. Symptoms and Signs After an incubation period of 2–3 weeks, onset is sudden, with a nonspecific virus-like prodrome: fever; back, hip, and leg pain; chills; headache; and nausea and vomiting. Abdom- inal pain may be present. Sore throat, conjunctivitis, rash, and adenopathy are absent, and respiratory symptoms are absent or limited to a dry cough. After 1–10 days (usually 3– 7), dyspnea, tachypnea, and evidence of a pulmonary capil- lary leak syndrome appear. This often progresses rapidly over a period of hours. Hypotension is common not only from hypoxemia, but also from myocardial dysfunction. Copious, amber-colored, nonpurulent secretions are com- mon. Decreased cardiac output due to myocardiopathy and elevated systemic vascular resistance distinguish this disease from early bacterial sepsis. B. Laboratory Findings The hemogram shows leukocytosis with a prominent left shift and immunoblasts, thrombocytopenia, and hemocon- centration. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated, as are liver function tests; serum albumin is low. Creatinine is elevated in some patients, and proteinuria is common. Lactic acidosis and low venous bicarbonate are poor prognostic signs. A serum IgM ELISA test is positive early in the illness. Otherwise the diagnosis is made by specific staining of tissue or PCR, usually at autopsy. C. Imaging Initial chest radiographs are normal. Subsequent radio- graphs show bilateral interstitial infiltrates with the typical butterfly pattern of acute pulmonary edema, bibasilar air- space disease, or both. Significant pleural effusions are often present. These findings contrast with those of other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome.  Differential Diagnosis In some geographic areas, plague and tularemia may be possibilities. Infections with viral respiratory pathogens and Mycoplasma have a slower tempo, do not elevate the LDH level, and do not cause the hematologic changes seen in this syndrome. Q fever, psittacosis, toxin exposure, legionellosis, and fungal infections are possibilities, but the history, tempo of the illness, and blood findings, as well as the exposure history, should be distinguishing features. Hantavirus car- diopulmonary syndrome is a consideration in previously healthy persons with a febrile illness associated with unex- plained pulmonary edema.  Treatment & Prognosis Ribavirin, to which hantaviruses and other bunyaviruses are susceptible, has not been demonstrated to alter the course of the illness. Management should concentrate on oxygen ther- apy and mechanical ventilation as required. Because of capillary leakage, Swan-Ganz catheterization to monitor car- diac output and inotropic support—rather than fluid ther- apy—should be used to maintain perfusion. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can provide short- term support for selected patients. The virus present in North America is not spread by person-to-person contact. No isolation is required. The case fatality rate is 30–40%. Guidelines are available for reduction of exposure to the infectious agent. Chang B et al: Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Semin Respir Crit Care Med 2007;28:193 [PMID: 17458773]. "
1127,Mumps,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,3517,"MUMPS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  No prior mumps immunization.  Parotid gland swelling.  Aseptic meningitis with or without parotitis.  General Considerations Mumps was one of the classic childhood infections; virus spread by the respiratory route attacked almost all unimmu- nized children (asymptomatically in 30–40% of cases), and produced lifelong immunity. The vaccine is so efficacious that clinical disease is rare in immunized children. As a result of subclinical infections or childhood immunization, 95% of adults are immune. Infected patients can spread the infec- tion from 1–2 days prior to the onset of symptoms and for 5 additional days. The incubation period is 14–21 days. A history of exposure to a child with parotitis is not proof of mumps exposure. In an adequately immunized individual, parotitis is usually due to another cause. Currently in the United States less than 1 case is reported per 100,000 population.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Salivary gland disease—Tender swelling of one or more glands, variable fever, and facial lymphedema are typical. Parotid involvement is most common; signs are bilateral in 70% of patients. The ear is displaced upward and outward; the mandibular angle is obliterated. Systemic tox- icity is usually absent. Parotid stimulation with sour foods may be quite painful. The orifice of the Stensen duct may be   CHAPTER 38 1106 red and swollen; yellow secretions may be expressed, but pus is absent. Parotid swelling dissipates after 1 week. 2. Meningoencephalitis—Prior to widespread immuniza- tion, mumps was the most common cause of aseptic menin- gitis, which is usually manifested by mild headache or asymptomatic mononuclear pleocytosis. Fewer than 10% of patients have clinical meningitis or encephalitis. Cerebral symptoms do not correlate with parotid symptoms, which are absent in many patients with meningoencephalitis. Although neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting can occur, encephalitic symptoms are rare (1:4000 cases of mumps); recovery in 3–10 days is the rule. 3. Pancreatitis—Abdominal pain may represent transient pancreatitis. Because salivary gland disease may elevate serum amylase, specific markers of pancreatic function (lip- ase, amylase isoenzymes) are required for assessing pancre- atic involvement. 4. Orchitis, oophoritis—Involvement of the gonads is asso- ciated with fever, local tenderness, and swelling. Epididymi- tis is usually present. Orchitis is unusual in young children but occurs in up to one third of affected postpubertal males. Usually it is unilateral and resolves in 1–2 weeks. Although one third of infected testes atrophy, bilateral involvement and sterility are rare. 5. Other—Thyroiditis, mastitis (especially in adolescent females), arthritis, and presternal edema (occasionally with dysphagia or hoarseness) may be seen. B. Laboratory Findings Peripheral blood leukocyte count is usually normal. Up to 1000 cells/μL (predominantly lymphocytes) may be present in the CSF, with mildly elevated protein and normal to slightly decreased glucose. Viral culture or PCR tests of saliva, throat, urine, or spinal fluid may be positive for at least 1 week after onset. Paired sera assayed by ELISA are currently used for diagnosis. Complement-fixing antibody to the soluble antigen disappears in several months; its presence in a single specimen thus indicates recent infection.  Differential Diagnosis Mumps parotitis may resemble the following conditions: cervical adenitis (the jaw angle may be obliterated, but the ear does not usually protrude; the Stensen duct orifice is normal; leukocytosis and neutrophilia are observed); bacte- rial parotitis (pus in the Stensen duct, toxicity, exquisite tenderness); recurrent parotitis (idiopathic or associated with calculi); tumors or leukemia; and tooth infections. Many viruses, including parainfluenza, enteroviruses, EBV, CMV, and influenza virus, can cause parotitis. Parotid swell- ing in HIV infection is less painful and tends to be bilateral and chronic, but bacterial parotitis occurs in some children with HIV infection. Unless parotitis is present, mumps meningitis resembles that caused by enteroviruses or early bacterial infection. An elevated amylase level is a useful clue in this situation. Isolated pancreatitis is not distinguishable from many other causes of epigastric pain and vomiting. Mumps is a classic cause of orchitis, but torsion, bacterial or chlamydial epi- didymitis, Mycoplasma infection, other viral infections, hematomas, hernias, and tumors must also be considered.  Complications The major neurologic complication is nerve deafness (usu- ally unilateral), which can result in inability to hear high tones. It may occur without meningitis. Permanent damage is rare, occurring in less than 0.1% of cases of mumps. Aqueductal stenosis and hydrocephalus (especially following congenital infection), myocarditis, transverse myelitis, and facial paralysis are other rare complications.  Treatment & Prognosis Treatment is supportive and includes provision of fluids, analgesics, and scrotal support for orchitis. Systemic cortico- steroids have been used for orchitis, but their value is anecdotal. Surgery is not recommended.

1128,Rabies,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,3999,"RABIES ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  History of animal bite 10 days to 1 year (usually < 90 days) previously.  Paresthesias or hyperesthesia in bite area.  Progressive limb and facial weakness in some patients (dumb rabies; 30%).  Irritability followed by fever, confusion, combative- ness, muscle spasms (especially pharyngeal with swal- lowing) in all patients (furious rabies).  Rabies antigen detected in corneal scrapings or tissue obtained by brain or skin biopsy; Negri bodies seen in brain tissue.  General Considerations Rabies remains a potentially serious public health problem wherever animal immunization is not widely practiced or when humans play or work in areas with sylvan rabies. Although infection does not always follow a bite by a rabid animal (about 40% infection rate following rabid dog bites),   INFECTIONS: VIRAL & RICKETTSIAL 1107 infection is almost invariably fatal. Any warm-blooded animal may be infected, but susceptibility and transmissibility vary with different species. Bats often carry and excrete the virus in saliva or feces for prolonged periods; they are the major cause of rabies in the United States. Dogs and cats are usually clinically ill within 10 days after becoming contagious (the standard quarantine period for suspect animals). Valid quar- antine periods or signs of illness are not fully known for many species. Rodents rarely transmit infection. Animal vaccines are very effective when properly administered, but a single inocu- lation may fail to produce immunity in up to 20% of dogs. The risk is assessed according to the type of animal (bats always considered rabid; raccoons, skunks, foxes in many areas); wound extent and location (infection more common after head or hand bites, or if wounds have extensive salivary contamina- tion or are not quickly and thoroughly cleaned); geographic area (urban rabies is rare to nonexistent in U.S. cities; rural rabies is possible, especially outside the United States); and animal vacci- nation history (risk low if documented). Most rabies in the United States is with genotypes found in bats, yet a history of bat bite is rarely obtained. Aerosolized virus in caves inhabited by bats has caused infection.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Paresthesias at the bite site are usually the first symptoms. Nonspecific anxiety, excitability, or depression follows, then muscle spasms, drooling, hydrophobia, delirium, and lethargy. Swallowing or even the sensation of air blown on the face may cause pharyngeal spasms. Seizures, fever, cranial nerve palsies, coma, and death follow within 7–14 days after onset. In a minority of patients, the spastic components are initially absent and the symptoms are primarily flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve defects. The furious components appear subsequently. B. Laboratory Findings Leukocytosis is common. CSF is usually normal or may show elevation of protein and mononuclear cell pleocytosis. Cere- bral imaging and electroencephalography are not diagnostic. Infection in an animal may be determined by use of the fluorescent antibody test to examine brain tissue for antigen. Rabies virus is excreted in the saliva of infected humans, but the diagnosis is usually made by antigen detection in scrap- ings or tissue samples of richly innervated epithelium, such as the cornea or the hairline of the neck. Classic Negri cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in brain tissue are not always present. Seroconversion occurs after 7–10 days.  Differential Diagnosis Failure to elicit the bite history in areas where rabies is rare may delay diagnosis. Other disorders to be considered include parainfectious encephalopathy; encephalitis due to herpes simplex, mosquito-borne viruses, other viruses; and Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Prevention See Chapter 9 for information regarding vaccination and postexposure prophylaxis. Rabies immune globulin and dip- loid cell vaccine have made prophylaxis more effective and minimally toxic; however, rare cases of prophylaxis failure are still being reported. Because rabies is almost always fatal, presumed exposures must be managed carefully.  Treatment & Prognosis Survival is rare but has been reported in patients receiving meticulous intensive care. No antiviral preparations are of proved benefit. Early diagnosis is important for the protec- tion and prophylaxis of individuals exposed to the patient.

1129,Rickettsial Infections,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,3697,"RICKETTSIAL INFECTIONS Rickettsiae are pleomorphic, gram-negative coccobacilli that are obligate intracellular parasites. Rickettsial diseases are often included in the differential diagnosis of febrile rashes, although some (notably Q fever) are not characterized by rash. Severe headache is a prominent symptom. The endo- thelium is the primary target tissue, and the ensuing vasculi- tis is responsible for severe illness. All rickettsioses except Q fever are transmitted by cuta- neous arthropod contact, either by bite or contamination of skin breaks with tick feces. Evidence of such contact by history or physical examination may be completely lacking, especially in young children. The geographic distribution of the vector is often the primary determinant for suspicion of these infections. Therapy often must be empiric. Many new broad-spectrum antimicrobials are inactive against these cell wall–deficient organisms; tetracycline is usually effective.

1129,Ehrlichiosis,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,4666,"EHRLICHIOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Residing or travel in endemic area when ticks are active.  Tick bite noted (~75%).  Fever, headache, rash (~67%), gastrointestinal symp- toms.  Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum trans- aminases, hypoalbuminemia.  Definitive diagnosis by specific serology.    CHAPTER 38 1108 Ehrlichia species are responsible for febrile pancytopenia in animals. In humans, Ehrlichia sennetsu is responsible for a mononucleosis-like syndrome seen in Japan and Malaysia. One agent of North American human ehrlichiosis has been identified as Ehrlichia chaffeensis. The reservoir hosts are probably wild rodents, deer, and sheep; ticks are the vectors. Most cases caused by this agent are reported in the south- central, southeastern, and middle Atlantic states. Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina are high-prevalence areas. Almost all cases occur between March and October, when ticks are active. A second ehrlichiosis syndrome, seen in the upper Mid- west and Northeast (Connecticut, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and New York are high-prevalence areas, is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and E ewingii. E chaffeensis has a predilection for mononuclear cells, whereas A phagocytophilum and E ewingii infect and produce intracytoplasmic inclusions in granulocytes. Hence diseases caused by these agents are referred to as human monocytic ehrlichiosis or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, respectively. Ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and babesiosis share some tick vectors; thus dual infections are common and should be considered in patients who fail to respond to therapy.  Clinical Findings In approximately 75% of patients, a history of tick bite can be elicited. The majority of the remaining patients report having been in a tick-infested area. The usual incubation period is 5–21 days. A. Symptoms and Signs Fever is universally present and headache is common (less so in children). Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea and vomiting) are reported in most pediat- ric patients. Distal limb edema may also occur in children. Chills, photophobia, conjunctivitis, and myalgia occur in more than half of patients. Rash occurs in two thirds of children with monocytic ehrlichiosis but is less common (~50%) in granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Rash may be erythema- tous, macular, papular, petechial, scarlatiniform, or vascu- litic. Meningitis occurs. Interstitial pneumonitis, acute respi- ratory distress syndrome, and renal failure occur in severe cases. Physical examination reveals rash (not usually palms and soles), mild adenopathy, and hepatomegaly. In children without a rash, infection may present as a case of fever of unknown origin. B. Laboratory Findings Laboratory abnormalities include leukopenia with left shift, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated aminotrans- ferase levels. Hypoalbuminemia is common. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur in severe cases. Anemia occurs in one third of patients. The definitive diagnosis is made serologically, either by a single high titer or a fourfold rise in titer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses appropriate antigens in an immunofluorescent anti- body test in order to distinguish between the etiologic agents. Intracytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) may occasionally be observed in mononuclear cells in monocytic ehrlichiosis, and are usually observed in polymorphonuclear cells from the peripheral blood or bone marrow in granulocytic ehr- lichiosis. Specific PCR testing is available for diagnosis.  Differential Diagnosis Erlichiosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of children in regions where these infections exist who present during tick season with fever, leucopenia or thrombocytope- nia (or both), and increased serum transaminase levels. Patients should be treated concurrently with attempts to establish the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes septic or toxic shock, other rickettsial infections (especially "

The disease may last several weeks if untreated. One quarter of hospitalized chil- dren require intensive care. Meningoencephalitis and per- sisting neurologic deficits occur in 5–10% of patients. Doxy- cycline, 2–4 mg/kg/d divided every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg per dose) for 7–10 days, is the treatment of choice. Response to therapy should be evident in 24–48 hours. Deaths are uncommon but do occur in children. Immune compromise is a risk factor for severe disease.

Most are named for their geographic area. In all except Rocky Mountain spotted fever and murine typhus, there is a characteristic eschar at the bite site, called the tache noire. Dogs and rodents are reservoirs of R rickettsii. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most severe of these infections and the most important (500–1000 cases per year) in the United States. It occurs predominantly along the eastern seaboard; in the southeastern states; and in Arkansas, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. It is much less common in the west. Most cases occur in children exposed in rural areas from April to September. Because tick attach- ment lasting 6 hours or longer is needed, frequent tick removal is a preventive measure.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs After the incubation period of 3–12 days (mean, 7 days), there is high fever (> 40°C, often hectic), usually of abrupt onset, myalgia, severe and persistent headache (retro-orbital; less obvious in infants), toxicity, photophobia, vomiting, and diarrhea. A rash occurs in more than 95% of patients and appears 2–6 days after fever onset as macules and papules; most characteristic (65%) is involvement of the palms, soles, and extremities. The rash becomes petechial and spreads centrally. Conjunctivitis, splenomegaly, edema, meningis- mus, irritability, and confusion may occur. B. Laboratory Findings Laboratory findings are nonspecific and reflect diffuse vascu- litis: thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, early mild leukope- nia, proteinuria, mildly abnormal liver function tests, hypo- albuminemia, and hematuria. CSF pleocytosis is common. Serologic diagnosis is achieved with indirect fluorescent or latex agglutination antibody methods, but generally only 7– 10 days after onset of the illness. Skin biopsy with specific fluorescent staining may give the diagnosis within the first week of the illness.  Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes meningococcemia, mea- sles, meningococcal meningitis, staphylococcal sepsis, entero- viral infection, leptospirosis, Colorado tick fever, scarlet fever, murine typhus, Kawasaki disease, and ehrlichiosis.  Treatment & Prognosis To be effective, therapy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever must be started early and is often based on a presumptive diagnosis in endemic areas prior to rash onset. It is important to remember that atypical presentations, such as the absence of pathognomonic rash, often lead to delay in appropriate therapy. Doxycycline is the agent of choice for children, regardless of age. Treatment should be continued for 2 or 3 days after the temperature has returned to normal for a full day. A minimum of 10 days of therapy is recommended. Complications and death result from severe vasculitis, especially in the brain, heart, and lung. The mortality rate is 5–7%. Persistent neurologic deficits occur. Delay in therapy is an important determinant of mortality. Alvarez AC et al: Fever and rash in a child: When to worry? Pediatr Ann 2007;36:30 [PMID: 17269281].

Endemic typhus is present in the southern United States, mainly in southern Texas, and in Southern California. The disease is transmitted by fleas from infected rodents, from their feces in scratches, or by inhalation. Domestic cats, dogs, and opossums may play a role in the transmis- sion of suburban cases. No eschar appears at the inocula- tion site, which may go unnoticed. The incubation period is 6–14 days. Headache, myalgia, and chills slowly worsen. Fever may last 10–14 days. After 3–8 days, a rash appears. Truncal macules and papules spread to the extremities; the rash is rarely petechial. The location of the rash in typhus, with sparing of the palms and soles, helps distin- guish the disease from Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rash may be absent in 20–40% of patients. Hepatomegaly may be present. Intestinal and respiratory symptoms may occur. Mild thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes may be present. The illness is usually self-limited and milder than epidemic typhus. More prolonged neurologic symptoms have been described. Therapy is usually not needed. Doxycycline is the drug of choice.

Coxiella burnetii is transmitted by inhalation rather than by an arthropod bite. The birth tissues and excreta of domestic animals and of some rodents are a major infectious source. Unpasteurized milk from infected animals may also transmit disease. Q fever is also distinguished from other rickettsial diseases by the infrequent occurrence of cutaneous manifes- tations and by the prominence of pulmonary disease.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Many patients have a self-limited flulike syndrome of chills, fever, severe headache, and myalgia of abrupt onset occurring 10–30 days after exposure. Abdominal pain, vomiting, chest pain, and dry cough are prominent in children. Examination of the chest may produce few findings, as in other atypical pneumonias. Hepatosplenomegaly is common. The illness lasts 1–4 weeks and frequently is associated with weight loss. B. Laboratory Findings Leukopenia with left shift is characteristic. Thrombocytope- nia is unusual and another distinction from other sympto- matic rickettsial diseases. Aminotransferase and γ-glutamyl transferase levels are elevated. Diagnosis is made by finding a complement-fixing antibody response (fourfold rise or sin- gle high titer) to the phase II organism. Chronic infection is indicated by antibody against the phase I organism. IgM ELISA and specific PCR tests are also available. C. Imaging Pneumonitis occurs in 50% of patients. Multiple segmental infiltrates are common, but the radiographic appearance is not pathognomonic. Consolidation and pleural effusion are rare.  Differential Diagnosis In the appropriate epidemiologic setting, Q fever should be considered in evaluating causes of atypical pneumonias such as from M pneumoniae, viruses, Legionella, and C pneumo- niae. It should also be included among the causes of mild to moderate hepatitis without rash or adenopathy in children with exposure to farm animals.  Treatment & Prognosis Typically the illness lasts 1–2 weeks without therapy. One complication is chronic disease, which often implies myo- carditis or granulomatous hepatitis. Meningoencephalitis is also a rare complication. C burnetii is also one of the causes of so-called culture- negative endocarditis. Endocarditis is difficult to treat; mor- tality approaches 50%. The course of the uncomplicated illness is shortened with tetracycline; doxycycline is pre- ferred. Therapy is continued for several days after the patient becomes afebrile. Quinolones are also effective. Cutler SJ et al: Q fever. J Infect 2007;54:313 [PMID:17147957]. Terheggen U, Leggat PA: Clinical manifestations of Q fever in adults and children.

1133,General Considerations,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,1145,"General Considerations Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that primarily infects cells of the immune system, includ- ing helper T lymphocytes (CD4 T lymphocytes), mono- cytes, and macrophages. The function and number of CD4 T lymphocytes and other affected cells are dimin- ished by HIV infection, with profound effects on both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. In the absence of treatment, HIV infection causes generalized immune incompetence, leading to conditions that meet the defini- tion of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and eventually death. The clinical diagnosis of AIDS is made when an HIV-infected child develops any of the opportunistic infections, malignancies, or conditions listed in category C of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) disease staging criteria (Table 39–1). In adults and adolescents, the criteria for a diagnosis of AIDS also include absolute CD4 lymphocyte counts of 200/μL or less. Combination antiretroviral treatment, available in resource-rich settings since 1996, can forestall disease progression for 10 years or longer in many patients. The full duration of the favorable outcome of therapy is not yet defined, and it is not known whether adverse effects from the medications will affect mortality or limit use. Nevertheless, HIV infection can be considered a chronic rather than acutely terminal disease for people with access to treatment.  Transmission & Epidemiology HIV is transmitted by sexual contact, percutaneous exposure to contaminated blood (eg, injecting drug use or transfusion with contaminated blood products), and mother-to-child (vertical) transmission. Vertical transmission may occur in utero, at the time of delivery, or via breast feeding. Risk factors associated with mother-to-child transmission include high maternal plasma HIV RNA, advanced maternal disease stage, low CD4 lymphocyte count, premature delivery, and factors related to increased exposure to maternal blood or cervical secretions at the time of delivery (eg, duration of rupture of membranes, presence of blood in the infant’s gastric secre- tions, and first-born twin delivery). Without intervention, 15– 30% of infants born to HIV-infected women will be infected. Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Click here for terms of use.    CHAPTER 39 1112 The rate of vertical transmission can be reduced to less than 2% by providing combination antiretroviral treatment to the mother during pregnancy and delivery, implementing recom- mended obstetric interventions, providing additional prophy- laxis to the infant during the first 6 weeks after birth, and avoidance of breast feeding. In the United States, as a result of prenatal and perinatal interventions, the number of vertically acquired AIDS cases declined 83% between 1992 (907 cases) and 2001 (150 cases). Most transmissions that occur involve women who do not receive antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, either because the infection is undiagnosed or because of lack of prenatal care. Mother-to-child transmission rates continue to be high in resource-limited settings where access to antiretroviral therapy and safe infant formula is infrequent. Worldwide, an estimated 2.3 million children are infected with HIV, most of them in Africa, South and South- east Asia, and parts of South America. In 2006, there were an estimated 530,000 new infections and 380,000 deaths in chil- dren younger than 15 years. Sexual activity (both heterosexual and homosexual) is the main mode of infection after puberty, with a smaller number of cases resulting from the sharing of contaminated needles. In the United States, seroprevalence rates are highest among gay men and injecting drug users. However, the proportion of new AIDS cases in 2005 acquired by heterosexual contact exceeded the proportion acquired by injecting drug use. Youth (ages 13–24 years) and women of color are dispropor- tionately represented among new cases. In developing nations, heterosexual contact is the most common mode of transmission among adults and the prevalence is slightly higher among women. As a result of careful donor screening and testing of the donated blood, HIV transmission resulting from blood products is now extremely rare (1:2,000,000 transfusions). Casual, classroom, or household contact with an HIV- infected person poses no risk.  "
1134,Pathogenesis,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,2052,"Pathogenesis Most transmission of HIV occurs via mucosal surfaces. Virus is transported to regional lymph nodes and by approxi- mately 48 hours after infection, replicating virus is found throughout all lymphoid tissues. Nonhuman primate mod- els using a related virus indicate that a massive loss of mature CD4 T-helper lymphocytes occurs during the first days of infection. During acute infection, high levels of HIV are detected in the bloodstream. In adults, the level of viremia declines without therapy concurrent with the appearance of an HIV-specific host immune response, and plasma viremia usually reaches a steady-state level about 6 months after primary infection. The amount of virus present in the plasma at that point and thereafter is predictive of the rate of disease progression for the individual. Despite ongoing virus replication, a period of clinical latency occurs, lasting from 1 year to more than 12 years during which the infected person is asymptomatic. The virus and anti-HIV immune responses are in a steady state, with high levels of virus production and destruction balanced against production and destruction of CD4 lymphocytes. Eventually, the balance favors the virus, Table 39–1. Clinical categories of children with  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

In the pre-antiretroviral treatment era, approximately 30% of infants with vertically acquired HIV infection had virus detectable in the blood at birth, presumed to be infection acquired in utero. In-utero infection represents a larger fraction of vertical infections in populations where interventions to prevent transmission, often initiated during the second trimester or later, are common. Infants who acquire HIV during labor and delivery test negative for HIV at birth but soon have detectable virus, usually by 2–4 weeks. The level of viremia rises steeply, reaching a peak at age 1–2 months. In contrast to adults, infants have a gradual decline in plasma viremia that extends beyond 2 years. Infants generally have plasma virus levels 10 times higher than those in adults. Less is known about the viral dynamics following transmission via breast feeding.  "
1135,Clinical Findings,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,981,"Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The manifestations described in this section are likely to be observed in children with untreated infection or in those unresponsive to therapy. Children given effective antiretro- viral therapy usually have few symptoms, most of which stem from use of these medications. The CDC has developed disease staging criteria for HIV- infected children (see Tables 39–1 and 39–2). The criteria incorporate clinical symptoms ranging from no symptoms to mild, moderate, and severe symptoms (categories N, A, B, and C, respectively) and age-adjusted CD4 lymphocyte counts (immunologic categories 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to none, moderate, or severe immune suppression, respec- tively). Each child is classified both by CD4 lymphocyte count and by clinical category. Category C diagnoses are the diseases associated with late-stage disease and confer a diag- nosis of AIDS. 1. Primary acute infection—The incubation period is 2–4 weeks for primary infection acquired by adults and adoles- cents through high-risk behavior. Nonspecific symptoms occur in 30–90% of new infections (eg, flu- or mild mono- nucleosis-like illness) but may not be brought to medical attention. In some U.S. cities, anonymous screening of blood samples demonstrates laboratory evidence of acute HIV infection in 1% of emergency department patients. Diagno- sis requires a high index of suspicion. Infected persons may present with fever, fatigue, malaise, pharyngitis, enlarged lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Less commonly seen signs, but more specific to HIV, are mild oral ulcerations; a diffuse macular, erythematous rash; and mild meningitis or encephalopathy. Occasionally, thrush, Candida esophagitis, or genital ulcers are observed. These early symptoms of primary infection resolve spontaneously within 1–2 weeks, although some persons have fatigue and depression for weeks or months. A primary infection syndrome is rarely recognized fol- lowing perinatal acquisition. Newborns with perinatal HIV infection are rarely symptomatic at birth. Size and physical features are not different from uninfected neonates. How- ever, 75–95% will demonstrate some sign (mostly nonspe- cific) by age 1 year. 2. Nonspecific symptoms—These may be observed in early- or late-stage disease. Frequent illness (especially recurrent otitis media or sinusitis) is typical, in addition to poor weight gain, chronic cough, chronic diarrhea, developmental delay, unexplained fevers, night sweats, generalized lymphadenopa- thy, parotid swelling, or hepatosplenomegaly. Delayed growth may be observed as early as age 4 months in some infants. These common early findings may be present for years in an otherwise well child. 3. Infections related to immunodeficiency—Progressive immune dysfunction in both humoral and cell-mediated responses results in susceptibility to infections. Recurrent or serious bacterial infections are more common in children than in HIV-infected adults. Bouts of bacteremia, especially due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, can occur in children without sup- pressed CD4 T-cell counts. Infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (usually acquired from adults in the household) may be severe. Primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections may be prolonged or severe. Herpes zoster (shingles), includ- ing multiple episodes, is common even in the era of combina- Table 39–2.

Evidence of severe suppression < 750 (< 15) < 500 (< 15) < 200 (< 15) Adapted from MMWR Recomm Rep 1994;43(RR-12):4.   HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION 1115 circulating virus, but soon have detectable virus. By age 6 weeks, almost all perinatally infected infants will become positive for HIV nucleic acid. An infant who is not breast feeding and has had at least two negative HIV cultures or nucleic acid detection tests, both performed after age 1 month and at least one performed after age 2–4 months, is very unlikely to be infected. The infant should be followed up for clinical symptoms and tested for HIV antibody at ages 12, 15, and 18 months to confirm reversion to seronegative status, thereby confirming the absence of infection. Breast-fed infants may acquire HIV at any time until they are fully weaned; to confirm absence of HIV infection, HIV nucleic acid tests should be preformed at least 6 weeks after the last exposure. The hallmark of HIV disease progression is decline in the absolute number and percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes and an increasing percentage of CD8 T lymphocytes. The CD4 T- lymphocyte values are predictive of the child’s risk of oppor- tunistic infections. Healthy infants have CD4 T-lymphocyte numbers and percentages much higher than in adults; these gradually decline to adult levels by age 6 years. Hence, age- adjusted values must be used when assessing a child’s CD4 T-lymphocyte parameters (see Table 39–2). Hypergammaglobulinemia of IgG, IgA, and IgM is char- acteristic and may be observed as early as age 9 months. Late in the disease, some individuals may become hypogamma- globulinemic. Hematologic abnormalities (anemia, neutro- penia, and thrombocytopenia) may occur due to effects of HIV disease or, more commonly, due to adverse effects of medications. With brain involvement, the cerebrospinal fluid may either be normal or the protein elevated and a mononuclear pleocytosis present. C. Imaging Cerebral imaging can demonstrate atrophy and calcification in the basal ganglia and frontal lobes in patients with encephalop- athy. Chest radiographs of children with lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis show diffuse interstitial reticulonodular infiltrates, occasionally with hilar adenopathy. The chest radiograph in P jiroveci pneumonia typically demonstrates perihilar infiltrates progressing to bilateral diffuse alveolar disease.  "
1137,Differential Diagnosis,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,2275,"Differential Diagnosis HIV infection should be in the differential diagnosis for children being evaluated for immunodeficiency. Depending on the degree of immunosuppression, the presentation in HIV infection may be similar to that in B-cell, T-cell, or combined immunodeficiencies, such as hypogammaglobinemia and severe combined immunodeficiency. (See Chapter 31.) HIV infection should also be considered in the evaluation of chil- dren with failure to thrive or developmental delay. Children or adolescents with chronic HIV infection may present with generalized lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly resem- bling infections with viruses such as EBV or CMV. Because blood tests are definitive for the diagnosis of HIV infection, the diagnosis can be readily established or excluded. The diagnosis of chronic HIV infection is made with HIV antibody testing in a child older than age 18 months. In younger infants, a negative result usually excludes HIV infection; a positive result must be confirmed by testing for viral nucleic acid. In rare cases, HIV-infected children with hypogammaglobulin- emia have falsely negative antibody tests. Any child suspected of having HIV infection whose serologic test results are nega- tive should be tested by a nucleic acid–based test. Absence of maternal risk factors or history of negative test results during pregnancy, particularly if documentation of the results is lacking, should not dissuade the provider from testing for HIV if the patient has signs consistent with the diagnosis. The symptoms of acute primary infection in the adoles- cent may be similar to those of mononucleosis caused by EBV or CMV, toxoplasmosis, rubella, secondary syphilis, influenza, enterovirus, or viral hepatitis. In the first weeks of acute infection, HIV antibody tests will be negative. How- ever, the diagnosis can be made by detection of HIV RNA in plasma. Seroconversion occurs over 2–6 weeks in sympto- matic patients. Diagnosis of acute HIV infection has impor- tant public health implications, because patients are highly infectious during the first months after infection. Studies are ongoing to determine if treatment during early infection improves prognosis. Thus, HIV RNA testing is warranted if the patient has a history of high-risk behavior or an alterna- tive diagnosis is lacking.  Prevention Vertical transmission can be substantially prevented by giv- ing antiretroviral medications to the mother during preg- nancy and to the newborn. Combination therapy that results in viral suppression to less than 1000 copies/mL reduces transmission rates to less than 1%. Therefore, the CDC and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology now recommend offering HIV testing, with an option to refuse, as a part of routine prenatal care for all pregnant women irrespective of risk factors. Women who present in labor should be tested for HIV antibody using recently approved rapid tests that give results within 60 minutes. Women found to be infected should be counseled regarding all HIV-related pregnancy care issues, including the benefits and risks of therapy with antiretroviral agents. Women in resource-rich settings generally receive three-drug combination regimens during pregnancy. Zidovudine should be incorporated into the regimen if possible because it has the greatest efficacy and safety of currently available drugs. Antiretroviral therapy begun in the last weeks of pregnancy, during labor, or even within 48 hours after birth, also reduces perinatal infection, although less profoundly. Short-course treatment can reduce transmission by 30–50% in women who are diagnosed late in pregnancy or at delivery. Elective cesarean delivery reduces the risk of transmission by 50% and should be offered to women who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy or who have viral loads over 1000 copies/mL despite treatment. Women receiving combi-   HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION 1115 circulating virus, but soon have detectable virus. By age 6 weeks, almost all perinatally infected infants will become positive for HIV nucleic acid. An infant who is not breast feeding and has had at least two negative HIV cultures or nucleic acid detection tests, both performed after age 1 month and at least one performed after age 2–4 months, is very unlikely to be infected. The infant should be followed up for clinical symptoms and tested for HIV antibody at ages 12, 15, and 18 months to confirm reversion to seronegative status, thereby confirming the absence of infection. Breast-fed infants may acquire HIV at any time until they are fully weaned; to confirm absence of HIV infection, HIV nucleic acid tests should be preformed at least 6 weeks after the last exposure. The hallmark of HIV disease progression is decline in the absolute number and percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes and an increasing percentage of CD8 T lymphocytes. The CD4 T- lymphocyte values are predictive of the child’s risk of oppor- tunistic infections. Healthy infants have CD4 T-lymphocyte numbers and percentages much higher than in adults; these gradually decline to adult levels by age 6 years. Hence, age- adjusted values must be used when assessing a child’s CD4 T-lymphocyte parameters (see Table 39–2). Hypergammaglobulinemia of IgG, IgA, and IgM is char- acteristic and may be observed as early as age 9 months. Late in the disease, some individuals may become hypogamma- globulinemic. Hematologic abnormalities (anemia, neutro- penia, and thrombocytopenia) may occur due to effects of HIV disease or, more commonly, due to adverse effects of medications. With brain involvement, the cerebrospinal fluid may either be normal or the protein elevated and a mononuclear pleocytosis present. C. Imaging Cerebral imaging can demonstrate atrophy and calcification in the basal ganglia and frontal lobes in patients with encephalop- athy. Chest radiographs of children with lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis show diffuse interstitial reticulonodular infiltrates, occasionally with hilar adenopathy. The chest radiograph in P jiroveci pneumonia typically demonstrates perihilar infiltrates progressing to bilateral diffuse alveolar disease.  Differential Diagnosis HIV infection should be in the differential diagnosis for children being evaluated for immunodeficiency. Depending on the degree of immunosuppression, the presentation in HIV infection may be similar to that in B-cell, T-cell, or combined immunodeficiencies, such as hypogammaglobinemia and severe combined immunodeficiency. (See Chapter 31.) HIV infection should also be considered in the evaluation of chil- dren with failure to thrive or developmental delay. Children or adolescents with chronic HIV infection may present with generalized lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly resem- bling infections with viruses such as EBV or CMV. Because blood tests are definitive for the diagnosis of HIV infection, the diagnosis can be readily established or excluded. The diagnosis of chronic HIV infection is made with HIV antibody testing in a child older than age 18 months. In younger infants, a negative result usually excludes HIV infection; a positive result must be confirmed by testing for viral nucleic acid. In rare cases, HIV-infected children with hypogammaglobulin- emia have falsely negative antibody tests. Any child suspected of having HIV infection whose serologic test results are nega- tive should be tested by a nucleic acid–based test. Absence of maternal risk factors or history of negative test results during pregnancy, particularly if documentation of the results is lacking, should not dissuade the provider from testing for HIV if the patient has signs consistent with the diagnosis.

For these women, the benefit and risk of cesarean delivery should be considered on an individual basis. Because breast milk can carry the virus, breast feeding by HIV-infected mothers is contraindicated when access to safe formula can be ensured. In developing countries transmission via breast milk remains a major mode of pediatric HIV infection. The only 100% effective method of avoiding sexual trans- mission of HIV infection is abstinence or limiting sexual contact to a mutually monogamous partner who is not HIV-infected. However, condoms—used consistently and correctly—are highly effective in preventing transmission between stable, sex- ually active couples in which only one partner is HIV-infected. In two studies, seroconversions occurred in 0–2% of discordant couples using condoms consistently compared with 10–15% of couples with inconsistent condom use. A third study reported 1.1 seroconversions per 100 person-years of observation among consistent condom users compared with 9.7 seroconversions among inconsistent users. The CDC provides detailed instruc- tions on correct condom use. Prompt "
1138,Treatment,Inborn Errors of Metabolism ,1234,"treatment of other sexu- ally transmitted diseases, especially those associated with muco- sal ulceration, also reduces the risk of sexual transmission. Postexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications begun as soon as possible is recommended for people with an occupational exposure that carries a risk of HIV transmis- sion. Prophylaxis is also recommended for people with a nonoccupational exposure that is not likely to recur (eg, sexual assault or condom rupture) who present within 72 hours of the exposure. Detailed guidelines regarding assess- ment of the level of risk and selection of postexposure therapy are published by the CDC. Horizontal transmission (ie, in the absence of sexual contact or injecting drug use) of HIV is exceedingly rare and is associ- ated with exposure of broken skin or mucous membranes to HIV-infected blood or bloody secretions. Because undiagnosed HIV-infected infants and children might be enrolled, all schools and day care centers should have policies with simple guidelines for using universal precautions to prevent transmission of HIV infection in these settings. Saliva, tears, urine, and stool are not contagious if there is no gross blood in these fluids. A barrier protection (eg, latex or rubber gloves or thick pads of fabric or paper) should be used when possible contact with blood or bloody body fluids may occur. Objects that might be contami- nated with blood, such as razors or toothbrushes, should not be shared. No special care is required for dishes, towels, toys, or bedclothes. Blood-soiled clothing may be washed routinely with hot water and detergent. Contaminated surfaces may be disin- fected easily with a variety of agents, including household bleach (1:10 dilution), some commercial disinfectants (eg, Lysol), or 70% isopropyl alcohol.  Treatment HIV infection calls for specific antiretroviral treatment to prevent progressive deterioration of the immune system as well as prophylactic measures at late stages of HIV infection to prevent opportunistic infections. Whenever possible, chil- dren should be enrolled in collaborative treatment studies. Current information on clinical trials may be obtained at: http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/clinical_trials Guidelines for the treatment of HIV developed by a national working group of pediatric HIV specialists are published by the U.S. Public Health System at: http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines The treatment paradigm changes frequently; therefore, prior to initiating treatment, expert consultation should be obtained. A. Specific Measures 1. Principles of HIV treatment—Treatment of HIV is aimed at suppressing viral replication. The rate of disease pro- gression is directly correlated with the number of HIV copies circulating in plasma. Antiretroviral treatment that reduces HIV replication is associated with increases in CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, reconstitution of immune function, and arrest of dis- ease progression. Children have a remarkable ability to restore normal CD4 T-cell counts, even when treatment is started at an advanced disease stage. However, it is clear that even the most potent regimens fail to eradicate virus. HIV persists in long- lived resting cells and cessation of antiretroviral treatment results in resumption of viremia and decline in CD4 lympho- cytes. Therefore, treatment for HIV with currently available modalities must be a lifelong endeavor. Once therapy has been initiated, the patient should be monitored every 3 months for changes in plasma virus copy number, CD4 lymphocyte count, symptoms, and adverse drug effects. Emergence of drug-resistant HIV during therapy is a major challenge. HIV has a high spontaneous mutation rate, and emergence of drug resistance during treatment is fre- quent. Many antiretroviral drugs select for resistant muta- tions in the virus within weeks to a few months when used as monotherapy. Prevention of resistance mutations requires complete suppression such that virus is not replicating and has no opportunity to generate new mutations. Achieving potent viral suppression requires a combination of at least three antiviral agents. Treatment with a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action provides an additional barrier to resistance as the virus must be resistant to all the drugs in the combination. Finally, strict adherence to the prescribed treatment is critical. Studies demonstrate that more than 95% of the doses must be taken in order to maintain optimal viral suppression. Therefore programs and services that enhance adherence are essential adjuncts of any HAART regimen. Determining the best time to initiate treatment is a subject of ongoing discussion and research. Once treatment is initiated there are risks of drug toxicity as well as the risk of developing drug resistance if adherence is suboptimal,   1123 40 Infections: Bacterial & Spirochetal John W.

Clinical findings that correlate with occult bacteremia in ambulatory patients include age (6–24 months), degree of temperature elevation (> 39.4°C), and leukocytosis (> 15,000/μL). Although each of these findings is in itself nonspecific, a combination of them should arouse suspicion. This constellation of findings in a child who has no focus of infection may be an indication for blood cultures and antibiotic therapy. The cause of most of such bacteremic episodes is pneumococci. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of acute purulent otitis media and is the organism responsible for most cases of acute bacterial pneumonia in children. The disease is indistinguishable on clinical grounds from other bacterial pneumonias. Effusions are common, although frank empy- ema is less common. Abscesses also occasionally occur. The incidence rate of pneumococcal meningitis has decreased since incorporation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into the infant vaccine schedule. However, pneumo- coccal meningitis is still more common than Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis. Pneumococcal meningitis, some- times recurrent, may complicate serious head trauma, partic- ularly if there is persistent leakage of CSF. This has led some physicians to recommend the prophylactic administration of penicillin or other antimicrobials in such cases. Children with sickle cell disease, other hemoglobinopa- thies, congenital or acquired asplenia, and some immunoglob- ulin and complement deficiencies are unusually susceptible to pneumococcal sepsis and meningitis. They often have a cata- strophic illness with shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Even with excellent supportive care, the mortality rate is 20–50%. The spleen is important in the control of pneumococcal infection by clearing organisms from the blood and producing an opsonin that enhances phagocytosis. Autosplenectomy may explain why children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of developing serious pneumococcal infections. Children with cochlear implants are at higher risk for pneumococcal meningitis. Children who have, or who are planning to receive, a cochlear implant should receive age-appropriate pneumococcal vacci- nation (> 2 weeks prior to surgery if possible). S pneumoniae rarely causes serious disease in the neonate. Although S pneumoniae does not normally colonize the vagina, transient colonization does occur. Serious neonatal disease—including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis— may occur and clinically is similar to GBS infection. Since being introduced in clinical medicine, penicillin has been the agent of choice for pneumococcal infections. Many strains are still highly susceptible to penicillin, and in those cases, penicillin is still the drug of choice. However, pneu- mococci with moderately increased resistance to penicillin are found in most communities, and reports of treatment failure, particularly in meningitis, are common. The preva-   CHAPTER 40 1134 prevail. The presence of large numbers of organisms without a prominent CSF inflammatory response or meningitis due to a penicillin-resistant strain indicates a poor prognosis.

1156,Staphylococcal Infections,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,1394,"STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTIONS Staphylococcal infections are common in childhood. Staphy- lococcal skin infections range from minor furuncles to the varied syndromes now collectively referred to as scalded skin syndrome. Staphylococci are the major cause of osteomyeli- tis and of septic arthritis and are an uncommon but impor- tant cause of bacterial pneumonia. A toxin produced by certain strains causes staphylococcal food poisoning. Staphy- lococci are responsible for most infections of artificial heart valves. They cause toxic shock syndrome (see later discus- sion). Finally, they are found in infections at all ages and in multiple sites, particularly when infection is introduced from the skin or upper respiratory tract or when closed compart- ments become infected (pericarditis, sinusitis, cervical aden- itis, surgical wounds, abscesses in the liver or brain, and abscesses elsewhere in the body). Staphylococci that do not produce the enzyme coagulase are termed coagulase-negative and are seldom speciated in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Most S aureus strains produce coagulase. S aureus and coagulase-negative staphy- lococci are normal flora of the skin and respiratory tract. The latter rarely cause disease except in compromised hosts, the newborn, or patients with plastic indwelling lines. Most strains of S aureus elaborate β-lactamase that confers penicillin resistance. This can be overcome in clinical practice by the use of a cephalosporin or a penicillinase-resistant peni- cillin, such as methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, cloxacillin, or dicloxacillin. Methicillin-resistant strains of S aureus (MRSA) are found worldwide and are now common in certain hospitals and, increasingly, in community-acquired infections in some areas of the United States. Most MRSA retain β-lactamase production, and many are resistant to other antibiotics as well. MRSA are also resistant in vivo to all of the penicillinase- resistant penicillins and cephalosporins. Strains with inter- mediate susceptibility to vancomycin are occurring more frequently and occasionally vancomycin-resistant strains are isolated. The existence of such strains is of concern because of the inherent virulence of most strains of S aureus and because of the limited choices for therapy. S aureus produces a variety of exotoxins, most of which are of uncertain importance. Two toxins are recognized as playing a central role in specific diseases: exfoliatin and staphylococcal enterotoxin. The former is largely responsible for the various clinical presentations of scalded skin syndrome. Most strains that elaborate exfoliatin are of phage group II. Enterotoxin causes staphylococcal food poisoning. The exoprotein toxin most commonly associated with toxic shock syndrome has been termed TSST-1. Panton- Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is an exotoxin produced by less than 5% of clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA) and MRSA strains. PVL is a virulence factor that causes leukocyte destruction and tissue necrosis. PVL-produc- ing S aureus strains are often community-acquired, and have most commonly produced boils and abscesses. However, they also have been associated with severe cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and deaths from necrotizing pneumonia in otherwise healthy children and young adults.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Staphylococcal skin diseases—Dermal infection with S aureus causes furuncles or cellulitis. S aureus are often found along with streptococci in impetigo. If the strains produce exfoliatin, localized lesions become bullous (bul- lous impetigo). Scalded skin syndrome is thought to be a systemic effect of exfoliatin. The initial infection may begin at any site but is in the respiratory tract in most cases. There is a prodro- mal phase of erythema, often beginning around the mouth, accompanied by fever and irritability. The involved skin becomes tender, and a sick infant will cry when picked up or touched. A day or so later, exfoliation begins, usually around the mouth. The inside of the mouth is red, and a peeling rash is present around the lips, often in a radial pattern. Generalized, painful peeling may follow, involving the limbs and trunk but often sparing the feet. More com- monly, peeling is confined to areas around body orifices. If erythematous but unpeeled skin is rubbed sideways, super- ficial epidermal layers separate from deeper ones and slough (Nikolsky sign). In the newborn, the disease is termed Ritter disease and may be fulminant. If there is tender erythema but not exfoliation, the disease is termed nonstreptococcal scarlet fever. The scarlatiniform rash is sandpaper-like, but straw- berry tongue is not seen, and cultures grow S aureus rather than streptococcus.   CHAPTER 40 1138 "

Less than 1% of carriers develop disease. Meningitis and sepsis are the two most common forms of illness, but septic arthritis, pericarditis, pneumonia, chronic meningo- coccemia, otitis media, conjunctivitis, and vaginitis also occur. The incidence of invasive diseases in the United States is about 1.2 cases per 100,000 people. An estimated 2400– 3000 cases occur in the United States annually. The highest attack rate for meningococcal meningitis is in the first year of life. There also is an elevated attack rate during the teen years. The development of irreversible shock with multior- gan failure is a significant factor in the fatal outcome of acute meningococcal infections. Meningococci are gram-negative organisms containing endotoxin in their cell walls. Endotoxins cause capillary vascular injury and leak as well as DIC. Meningococci are classified serologically into groups: A, B, C, Y, and W-135 are the groups most commonly implicated in systemic disease. The serologic groups serve as markers for studying outbreaks and transmission of disease. Currently in the United States, serogroup B accounts for about one third of cases. Serogroups C and Y each cause 25% of cases, and serogroup W-135 is responsible for about 15%. Serogroup A causes periodic epidemics in developing countries, but only occasionally is associated with cases of meningococcal dis- ease in the United States. Sulfonamide resistance is common in non–serotype-A strains. N meningitidis with increased MICs to penicillin G are reported from South Africa and Spain. A small number of these isolates are reported in the United States. The resistance in these strains is low-level and not due to β-lactamase. Resistant isolates are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. Few isolates are resistant to rifampin. Children develop immunity from asymptomatic carriage of meningococci (usually nontypeable, nonpathogenic strains) or other cross-reacting bacteria. Patients deficient in one of the late components of complement (C6, C7, C8, or C9) are uniquely susceptible to meningococcal infection, particu- larly group A meningococci. Deficiencies of early and alter- nate pathway complement components also are associated with increased susceptibility.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Many children with clinical meningococcemia also have meningitis, and some have other foci of infection. All chil- dren with suspected meningococcemia should have a lumbar puncture. 1. Meningococcemia—A prodrome of upper respiratory infection is followed by high fever, headache, nausea, marked toxicity, and hypotension. Purpura, petechiae, and occasionally bright pink, tender macules or papules over the extremities and trunk are seen. The rash usually progresses rapidly. Occasional cases lack rash. Fulminant meningococ- cemia (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) progresses rap- idly and is characterized by DIC, massive skin and mucosal hemorrhages, and shock. This syndrome also may be caused by H influenzae, S pneumoniae, or other bacteria. Chronic meningococcemia is characterized by periodic bouts of fever, arthralgia or arthritis, and recurrent petechiae. Splenomeg- aly often is present. Patients may be free of symptoms between bouts. Chronic meningococcemia occurs primarily in adults and mimics Henoch-Schönlein purpura. 2. Meningitis—In many children, meningococcemia is fol- lowed within a few hours to several days by symptoms and signs of acute purulent meningitis, with severe headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, and stupor. Children with meningitis generally fare better than children with meningo- coccemia alone, probably because they have survived long enough to develop clinical signs of meningitis. B. Laboratory Findings The peripheral WBC count may be either low or elevated. Thrombocytopenia may be present with or without DIC. (See Chapter 28.) If petechial or hemorrhagic lesions are present, meningococci can sometimes be seen microscopi- cally in tissue fluid expressed from a punctured lesion. CSF is generally cloudy and contains more than 1000 WBCs/μL, with many polymorphonuclear neutrophils and gram-nega- tive intracellular diplococci. A total hemolytic complement assay may reveal absence of late components as an underly- ing cause.  Differential Diagnosis The skin lesions of H influenzae or pneumococci, enterovirus infection, endocarditis, leptospirosis, Rocky Mountain spot- ted fever, other rickettsial diseases, Henoch-Schönlein pur- pura, and blood dyscrasias may be similar to meningococce- mia. Other causes of sepsis and meningitis are distinguished by appropriate Gram stain and cultures.   CHAPTER 40 1140 and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. Purpura and fever should be considered a medical emergency. Children with meningococcemia or meningococcal men- ingitis should be treated as though shock were imminent even if their vital signs are stable when they are first seen. If hypotension already is present, supportive measures should be aggressive, because the prognosis is grave in such situations. Treatment should be started emergently and in an intensive care setting but should not be delayed for the sake of trans- porting the patient. Shock may worsen following antimicro- bial therapy due to endotoxin release. To minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission, patients should be placed in respira- tory isolation for the first 24 hours of antibiotic treatment. A. Specific Measures Antibiotics should be initiated promptly. Because other bacte- ria, such as S pneumoniae, S aureus, or other gram-negative organisms, can cause identical syndromes, initial therapy should be broad. Vancomycin and cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) are preferred initial coverage. Once N meningitidis has been isolated, penicillin G, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone intravenously for 7 days are the drugs of choice. Relative penicillin resistance is uncommon but has been reported in the United States. B. General Measures Most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are treated with intravenous antibiotics for 7 days. 1. Cardiovascular—(See Chapter 13 for management of sep- tic shock.) Corticosteroids are not beneficial. Sympathetic blockade and topically applied nitroglycerin have been used locally to improve perfusion. 2. Hematologic—Adjunctive therapy with heparin is contro- versial. Because hypercoagulability is frequently present in patients with meningococcemia, some experts believe heparin should be considered for those with DIC. A loading dose of 50 units/kg is followed by 15 units/kg/h as a continuous infusion. The patient is monitored by following the partial thromboplas- tin time and heparin assay. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, concentrated antithrombin III, and recombinant pro- tein C infusions have been tried experimentally to reverse coagulopathy. (See Chapter 28 for the management of DIC.)  Prognosis Unfavorable prognostic features include shock, DIC, and extensive skin lesions. The case fatality rate in fulminant men- ingococcemia is over 30%. In uncomplicated meningococcal meningitis, the fatality rate is much lower (10–20%).

1162,Gonococcal Infections,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,3087,"GONOCOCCAL INFECTIONS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Purulent urethral discharge with intracellular gram- negative diplococci on smear in male patients (usually adolescents).  Purulent, edematous, sometimes hemorrhagic conjunc- tivitis with intracellular gram-negative diplococci in 2–4– day-old infants.  Fever, arthritis (often polyarticular) or tenosynovitis, and maculopapular peripheral rash that may be vesiculopus- tular or hemorrhagic.  Positive culture of blood, pharyngeal, or genital secretions.  General Considerations Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus. Although morphologically similar to other neisseriae, it differs in its ability to grow on selective media and to ferment carbohydrates. The cell wall of N gonorrhoeae contains endo- toxin, which is liberated when the organism dies and is responsible for the production of a cellular exudate. The incubation period is short, usually 2–5 days.  Nearly 340,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported in the United States in 2005. Gonococcal disease in children may be transmitted sexually or nonsexually. Prepubertal gonococcal infection outside the neonatal period should be considered presumptive evidence of sexual contact or child abuse. Pre- pubertal girls usually manifest gonococcal vulvovaginitis because of the neutral to alkaline pH of the vagina and thin vaginal mucosa. In the adolescent or adult, the workup of every case of gonorrhea should include a careful and accurate inquiry into the patient’s sexual practices, because pharyngeal infection resulting from oral sex must be detected if present and may be difficult to eradicate. Efforts should be made to identify and provide treatment to all sexual contacts. When prepu- bertal children are infected, epidemiologic investigation should be thorough. Antimicrobial-resistant gonococci are a serious problem. N gonorrhoeae infections resistant to tetracyclines, penicil- lins, and fluoroquinolones are common. Fluoroquinolone antimicrobials are no longer recommended for therapy in the United States. In some cases, clinicians will have very limited choices for therapy. Many clinical laboratories do not   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1143 D. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Doxycycline (100 mg twice a day orally) and either cefoxitin (2 g intramuscularly or intravenously every 6 hours) or cefotetan (2 g intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours) are given until the patient is clinically improved, then doxycycline is adminis- tered by mouth to complete 14 days of therapy. Clindamycin and gentamicin given intravenously until the patient improves clinically may be used rather than cefoxitin. Many other regi- mens have been used for therapy of pelvic inflammatory disease, although comparative efficacy data are limited. E. Prepubertal Gonococcal Infections 1. Uncomplicated genitourinary, rectal, or pharyngeal infections—These infections may be treated with ceftriaxone (25–50 mg/kg/d to a maximum of 125 mg intramuscularly in a single dose). Children older than age 8 years should also receive doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days). The physician should evaluate all children for evidence of sexual abuse and coinfection with syphilis, Chlamydia, and HIV. 2.

1165,Botulism,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,1617,"BOTULISM ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Dry mucous membranes.  Nausea and vomiting.  Diplopia; dilated, unreactive pupils.  Descending paralysis.  Difficulty in swallowing and speech occurring within 12– 36 hours after ingestion of toxin-contaminated food.  Multiple cases in a family or group.  Hypotonia and constipation in infants.  Diagnosis by clinical findings and identification of toxin in blood, stool, or implicated food.  General Considerations Botulism is a paralytic disease caused by Clostridium botuli- num, an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus normally found in soil. The organism produces an extremely potent neurotoxin. Of the seven types of toxin (A–G), types A, B, and E cause most human diseases. The toxin, a polypeptide, is so potent that 0.1 mg is lethal for humans. Food-borne botulism usually results from ingestion of toxin-containing food. Preformed toxin is absorbed from the gut and produces paralysis by preventing acetylcholine release from cholinergic fibers at myoneural junctions. In the United States, home-canned vegetables are usually the cause. Commercially canned foods rarely are responsible. Virtually any food will support the growth of C botulinum spores into vegetative toxin-producing bacilli if an anaerobic, nonacid environment is provided. The food may not appear or taste spoiled. The toxin is heat-labile, but the spores are heat- resistant. Inadequate heating during processing (tempera- ture < 115°C) allows the spores to survive and later resume toxin production. Boiling of foods for 10 minutes or heating at 80°C for 30 minutes before eating will destroy the toxin. Infant botulism is seen in infants younger than age 6 months (median, 10 weeks). The initial symptoms are usu- ally constipation and progressive, often severe hypotonia. Infants younger than age 2 weeks rarely develop botulism. The toxin appears to be produced by C botulinum organisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract. In some instances, honey has been the source of spores. Clinical findings include constipation, weak suck and cry, pooled oral secre- tions, cranial nerve deficits, generalized weakness, and, on occasion, apnea. The characteristic electromyographic pat- tern of brief, small, abundant motor-unit action potentials (BSAPs) may help confirm the diagnosis. Annually, 10–15 cases of wound botulism are reported. Most cases occur in drug abusers with infection in intrave- nous or intramuscular injection sites. Botulism, as a result of aerosolization of botulinum toxin, also could occur as the result of a bioterrorism event. Only three such cases of botulism have been reported; the incuba- tion period was not well-defined, but was about 72 hours in the reported cases.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The incubation period for food-borne botulism is 8–36 hours. The initial symptoms are lethargy and headache. These are followed by double vision, dilated pupils, ptosis, and, within a few hours, difficulty with swallowing and speech. Pharyngeal paralysis occurs in some cases, and food may be regurgitated. The mucous membranes often are very dry. Descending skeletal muscle paralysis may be seen. Death usually results from respiratory failure. Botulism patients present with a “classic triad”: (1) afe- brile; (2) symmetrical, flaccid, descending paralysis with prominent bulbar palsies; and (3) clear sensorium. Recogni- tion of this triad is important in making the clinical diagno- sis. Botulism is caused by a toxin, thus there is no fever unless   CHAPTER 40 1144 secondary infection (eg, aspiration pneumonia) occurs. Common bulbar palsies seen include dysphonia, dysphagia, dysarthria, and diplopia (4 “Ds”). B. Laboratory Findings The diagnosis is made by demonstration of C botulinum toxin in stool, gastric aspirate or vomitus, or serum. Serum and stool samples can be sent for toxin confirmation (done by toxin neutralization mouse bioassay at CDC or state health departments). Foods that are suspected to be contam- inated should be kept refrigerated and given to public health personnel for testing. Laboratory findings, including CSF examination, are usually normal. Electromyography suggests the diagnosis if the characteristic BSAP abnormalities are seen. A nondiagnostic electromyogram does not exclude the diagnosis.  Differential Diagnosis Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by ascending paralysis, sensory deficits, and elevated CSF protein without pleocytosis. Other illnesses that should be considered include polio- myelitis, postdiphtheritic polyneuritis, certain chemical intoxications, tick paralysis, and myasthenia gravis. The history and elevated CSF protein characterize postdiphthe- ritic polyneuritis. Tick paralysis presents with a flaccid ascending motor paralysis. An attached tick should be sought. Myasthenia gravis usually occurs in adolescent girls. It is characterized by ocular and bulbar symptoms, normal pupils, fluctuating weakness, absence of other neurologic signs, and clinical response to cholinesterase inhibitors.  Complications Difficulty in swallowing leads to aspiration pneumonia. Serious respiratory paralysis may be fatal despite assisted ventilation and intensive supportive measures.  Treatment A. Specific Measures Early treatment of botulism with antitoxin (food-borne or wound botulism) or passive human botulism immune glob- ulin (infant botulism) is beneficial. Treatment should begin as soon as the clinical diagnosis is made (prior to microbio- logic or toxin confirmation). For suspected wound or food-borne botulism, equine antitoxins are available from the CDC through state health departments. Patients should be treated with the bivalent antitoxin (types A and B) and possibly also the monovalent (type E) antitoxin. The state health department or the CDC ([770] 488-7100) can be contacted for help in obtaining products and for consultation. Both preparations are given by slow intravenous infusion. All patients need to be screened for hypersensitivity to the products prior to initiat- ing the infusion; small challenge doses are given (see package insert). Patients who have reactions to the challenge doses are desensitized prior to receiving antitoxin infusion. In addition to the antitoxin, 24-hour diagnostic consultation, epidemic assistance, and laboratory testing services are avail- able from the CDC through state health departments. For treatment of infant botulism, intravenous human botulism immune globulin (Baby-BIG) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use. Baby- BIG is a product containing high titers of neutralizing antibodies against type A and B toxin and is made from pooled plasma of adults who were immunized with a botu- lism toxoid vaccine. Results of a placebo-controlled clinical trial of use in infant botulism showed reduction in the mean hospital stay (2.5 weeks in treated patients vs 5.5 weeks in the placebo group) and decrease in mechanical ventilation time in the Baby-BIG–treated group. Although the cost of the preparation is high ($45,000 in 2007), it still is cost-saving since there is a substantial reduction in hospital days, inten- sive care unit stay, and ventilator time in treated infants. Baby-BIG is not indicated for use in any form of botulism (wound, food-borne) other than infant botulism. To obtain Baby-BIG (in any state), contact the California Department of Public Health at: (510) 540-2646. B. General Measures General and supportive therapy consists of bed rest, ventila- tory support (if necessary), fluid therapy, enteral or paren- teral nutrition, and administration of purgatives and high enemas. Aminoglycoside antimicrobials and clindamycin may exacerbate neuromuscular blockage and should be avoided.  Prognosis The mortality rate has declined substantially in recent years and currently is at 6%. In nonfatal cases, symptoms subside over 2–3 months and recovery is usually complete. Fox CK et al: Recent advances in infant botulism. Pediatr Neurol 2005;32:149 [PMID: 15730893].

1166,Tetanus,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,4770,"TETANUS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Nonimmunized or partially immunized patient.  History of skin wound.  Spasms of jaw muscles (trismus).   CHAPTER 40 1146 given intramuscularly. If tetanus immunization is incom- plete, a dose of age-appropriate vaccine should be given. When both are indicated, tetanus toxoid and TIG should be administered concurrently at different sites using different syringes. (See Chapter 9.) Prophylactic antimicrobials are useful if the child is unimmunized and TIG is not available.  Treatment A. Specific Measures Serotherapy lowers the mortality rate from tetanus, but not dramatically. Human TIG in a single dose of 3000–6000 units, intramuscularly, is given to children and adults. Doses of 500 units have been used in infants. If TIG is indicated, but not available, intravenous immune globulin in a dose of 200–400 mg/kg intravenously can be used. Surgical debride- ment of wounds is indicated, but more extensive surgery or amputation to eliminate the site of infection is not necessary. Antibiotics are given to attempt to decrease the number of vegetative forms of the bacteria to decrease toxin produc- tion: oral metronidazole (30 mg/kg/d in four divided doses; maximum 4 g/d) for 10–14 days is the preferred agent. B. General Measures The patient is kept in a quiet room with minimal stimula- tion. Control of spasms and prevention of hypoxic episodes are crucial. Diazepam or another anxiolytic is useful (0.6–1.2 mg/kg/d intravenously in six divided doses). In the newborn, two or three divided doses should be given. Large doses (up to 25 mg/kg/d) may be required for older children. Diaz- epam is given intravenously until muscular spasms become infrequent and the generalized muscular rigidity much less prominent. The drug may then be given orally and the dosage reduced as the child improves. Mechanical ventila- tion and muscle paralysis are necessary in severe cases. Nasogastric or intravenous feedings should be used to limit stimulation of feedings and prevent aspiration.  Prognosis The fatality rate in newborns and heroin-addicted individu- als is high. The overall mortality rate in the United States is 11%. The fatality rate depends on the quality of supportive care, the patient’s age, and the patient’s vaccination history. Many deaths are due to pneumonia or respiratory failure. If the patient survives 1 week, recovery is likely.

1168,Gas Gangrene,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,2636,"GAS GANGRENE ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Contamination of a wound with soil or feces.  Massive edema, skin discoloration, bleb formation, and pain in an area of trauma.  Serosanguineous exudate from wound.  Crepitation of subcutaneous tissue.  Rapid progression of signs and symptoms.  Clostridia cultured or seen on stained smears.  General Considerations Gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) is a necrotizing infection that follows trauma or surgery and is caused by several anaero- bic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacilli of the genus Clostrid- ium. The spores are found in soil, feces, and vaginal secretions. In devitalized tissue, the spores germinate into vegetative bacilli that proliferate and produce toxins, causing thrombosis, hemol- ysis, and tissue necrosis. Clostridium perfringens, the species causing approximately 80% of cases of gas gangrene, produces at least eight such toxins. The areas involved most often are the extremities, abdomen, and uterus. Clostridium septicum may also cause myonecrosis and causes septicemia in patients with neutropenia. Nonclostridial infections with gas formation can mimic clostridial infections and are more common. Neutrope- nia is a risk factor for this severe infection.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The onset of gas gangrene usually is sudden, often 1 day after trauma or surgery (mean, 3–4 days), but can be delayed up to 20 days. The skin around the wound becomes discolored, with hemorrhagic bullae, serosanguineous exudate, and crepitation in the subcutaneous tissues. Pain and swelling usually are intense. Systemic illness appears early and progresses rapidly to intravascular hemolysis, jaundice, shock, toxic delirium, and renal failure. B. Laboratory Findings Isolation of the organism requires anaerobic culture. Gram- stained smears may demonstrate many gram-positive rods and few inflammatory cells. C. Imaging Radiographs may demonstrate gas in tissues, but this is a late finding and is also seen in infections with other gas-forming organisms or may be due to air introduced into tissues during trauma or surgery.   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1147 D. Operative Findings Direct visualization of the muscle at surgery may be neces- sary to diagnose gas gangrene. Early, the muscle is pale and edematous and does not contract normally; later, the muscle may be frankly gangrenous.  Differential Diagnosis Gangrene and cellulitis caused by other organisms and clostridial cellulitis (not myonecrosis) must be distinguished. Necrotizing fasciitis may resemble gas gangrene.  Prevention Gas gangrene can be prevented by the adequate cleansing and debridement of all wounds. It is essential that foreign bodies and dead tissue be removed. A clean wound does not provide a suitable anaerobic environment for the growth of clostridial species.  Treatment A. Specific Measures Penicillin G (300,000–400,000 units/kg/d intravenously in six divided doses) should be given, usually combined with clindamycin or metronidazole. Clindamycin, metronidazole, meropenem, and imipenem–cilastatin are alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients. Some experts recommend a com- bination of penicillin and clindamycin. B. Surgical Measures Surgery should be prompt and extensive, with removal of all necrotic tissue. C. Hyperbaric Oxygen Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to be effective, but it is not a substitute for surgery. A patient may be exposed to 2–3 atm in pure oxygen for 1- to 2-hour periods for as many sessions as necessary until clinical remission occurs.  Prognosis Clostridial myonecrosis is fatal if untreated. With early diagnosis, antibiotics, and surgery, the mortality rate is 20– 60%. Involvement of the abdominal wall, leukopenia, intra- vascular hemolysis, renal failure, and shock are ominous prognostic signs. Langham M, Arnold L: Clostridial myonecrosis in an adolescent male.

1169,Diphtheria,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,1989,"DIPHTHERIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Gray, adherent pseudomembrane, most often in the pharynx but also in the nasopharynx or trachea.  Sore throat, serosanguineous nasal discharge, hoarse- ness, and fever in a nonimmunized child.  Peripheral neuritis or myocarditis.  Positive culture.  Treatment should not be withheld pending culture results.  General Considerations Diphtheria is an acute infection of the upper respiratory tract or skin caused by toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Diphtheria in the United States is rare; five cases have been reported since 2000, and only 48 cases were reported from 1980–1997. However, significant numbers of elderly adults and unimmunized children are susceptible to infection. Diphtheria still occurs in epidemics in countries where immunization is not universal. Travelers to these areas may acquire the disease. Corynebacteria are gram-positive, club-shaped rods with a beaded appearance on Gram stain. The capacity to produce exotoxin is conferred by a lysogenic bacteriophage and is not present in all strains of C diphtheriae. In immunized communi- ties, infection probably occurs through spread of the phage among carriers of susceptible bacteria rather than through spread of phage-containing bacteria themselves. Diphtheria toxin kills susceptible cells by irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis. The toxin is absorbed into the mucous membranes and causes destruction of epithelium and a superficial inflammatory response. The necrotic epithelium becomes embedded in exud- ing fibrin and red and white blood cells, forming a grayish pseudomembrane over the tonsils, pharynx, or larynx. Any attempt to remove the membrane exposes and tears the capillar- ies, resulting in bleeding. The diphtheria bacilli within the membrane continue to produce toxin, which is absorbed and may result in toxic injury to heart muscle, liver, kidneys, and adrenals, and is sometimes accompanied by hemorrhage. The toxin also produces neuritis, resulting in paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, or extremities. Death may occur as a result of respiratory obstruction or toxemia and circulatory collapse. The patient may succumb after a somewhat longer time as a result of cardiac damage. The incubation period is 2–7 days.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1.

1171,Enterobacteriaceae,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,436,"ENTEROBACTERIACEAE ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Diarrhea by several different mechanisms due to Escherichia coli.  Hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome.  Neonatal sepsis or meningitis.  Urinary tract infection.  Opportunistic infections.  Diagnosis confirmed by culture.  General Considerations Enterobacteriaceae are a family of gram-negative bacilli that are normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract and are also found in water and soil. They cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, neonatal sepsis and meningitis, and oppor- tunistic infections. Escherichia coli is the organism in this family that most commonly causes infection in children, but Klebsiella, Morganella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus, and other genera are also important, particularly in the compro- mised host. Shigella and Salmonella are discussed in separate sections. E coli strains capable of causing diarrhea were originally termed enteropathogenic (EPEC) and were recognized by serotype. It is now known that E coli may cause diarrhea by several distinct mechanisms. Classic EPEC strains cause a characteristic histologic injury in the small bowel termed adherence and effacement. Enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC) causes a secretory, watery diarrhea. ETEC adheres to enterocytes and secretes one or more plasmid-encoded enterotoxins. One of these, heat-labile toxin, resembles cholera toxin in structure, function, and mechanism of action. Enteroinvasive E coli (EIEC) are very similar to Shigella in their pathogenetic mechanisms. Enterohemor- rhagic E coli (EHEC) cause hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The most common EHEC serotype is O157:H7, although several other serotypes cause the same syndrome. These strains elaborate one of several cytotoxins, closely related to Shiga toxin produced by Shi- gella dysenteriae. Outbreaks of hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with EHEC have followed consumption of inade- quately cooked ground beef. Thorough heating to 68–71°C is necessary. Unpasteurized fruit juice, various uncooked vege- tables, and contaminated water also have caused infections and epidemics. The common source for EHEC in all of these foods and water is the feces of cattle. Person-to-person spread including spread in day care centers by the fecal-oral route has been reported. E coli that aggregate on the surface of hep cells in tissue culture are termed enteroaggregative (EAggEC) E coli. EAggEC cause diarrhea by a distinct but unknown mechanism. Eighty percent of E coli strains causing neonatal meningi- tis possess specific capsular polysaccharide (K1 antigen), which, alone or in association with specific somatic antigens, confers virulence. Approximately 90% of urinary tract infec- tions in children are caused by E coli. E coli binds to the uroepithelium by P-fimbriae, which are present in more than 90% of E coli that cause pyelonephritis. Other bacterial cell surface structures, such as O and K antigens, and host factors are also important in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Morganella are nor- mally found in the gastrointestinal tract and in soil and water. Klebsiella may cause a bronchopneumonia with cavity formation. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia are often hospital-acquired opportunists associated with antibiotic usage, debilitated states, and chronic respiratory conditions. They frequently cause urinary tract infection or sepsis. In many newborn nurseries, nosocomial outbreaks caused by antimicrobial-resistant Klebsiella or Enterobacter species are a major problem. Many of these infections are difficult to treat because of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility tests are neces- sary. Parenteral third-generation cephalosporins are usually more active than ampicillin, but resistance due to high-level production of chromosomal cephalosporinase may occur. Enterobacter and Serratia strains broadly resistant to cepha- losporins also cause infections in hospitalized newborns and children. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are usually effective but require monitoring of serum levels to ensure therapeutic and nontoxic levels.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. E coli gastroenteritis—E coli may cause diarrhea of varying types and severity. ETEC usually produce mild, self-limiting illness without significant fever or systemic toxicity, often known as traveler’s diarrhea. However, diar- rhea may be severe in newborns and infants, and occasion- ally an older child or adult will have a cholera-like syndrome. EIEC strains cause a shigellosis-like illness, characterized by fever, systemic symptoms, blood and mucus in the stool, and leukocytosis, but currently are uncommon in the United States. EHEC strains cause hemorrhagic colitis.

1173,Pseudomonas,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,944,"PSEUDOMONAS INFECTIONS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Opportunistic infection.  Confirmed by cultures.  General Considerations Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an aerobic gram-negative rod with versatile metabolic requirements. The organism may grow in distilled water and in commonly used disinfectants, compli- cating infection control in medical facilities. P aeruginosa is both invasive and destructive to tissue as well as toxigenic due to secreted exotoxins, all factors that contribute to virulence. Other genera previously classified as Pseudomonas frequently cause nosocomial infections and infections in immunocom- promised children. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (previously P maltophilia) and Burkholderia cepacia (previously P cepacia) are the most frequent. P aeruginosa is an important cause of infection in chil- dren with cystic fibrosis, neoplastic disease, neutropenia, or extensive burns and in those receiving antibiotic therapy. Infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts, ears, mas- toids, paranasal sinuses, eyes, skin, meninges, and bones are seen. Pseudomonas pneumonia is a common nosocomial infection in patients receiving assisted ventilation. P aeruginosa sepsis may be accompanied by characteristic peripheral lesions called ecthyma gangrenosum. Ecthyma gangrenosum also may occur by direct invasion through intact skin in the groin, axilla, or other skinfolds. P aeruginosa is an infrequent cause of sepsis in previously healthy infants and may be the initial sign of underlying medical problems. P aeruginosa osteomyelitis often complicates puncture wounds of the feet. P aeruginosa is a frequent cause of malignant external otitis media and of chronic suppurative otitis media. Outbreaks of vesiculopustular skin rash have been associated with exposure to contaminated water in whirlpool baths and hot tubs. P aeruginosa infects the tracheobronchial tree of nearly all patients with cystic fibrosis. Mucoid exopolysaccharide, an exuberant capsule, is characteristically overproduced by iso- lates from patients with cystic fibrosis. Although bacteremia seldom occurs, patients with cystic fibrosis ultimately suc- cumb to chronic lung infection with P aeruginosa. Infection due to B cepacia has caused a rapidly progressive pulmonary disease in some colonized patients and may be spread by close contact. Osteomyelitis of the calcaneus or other foot bones occurs after punctures such as stepping on a nail and is commonly due to P aeruginosa.  Clinical Findings The clinical findings depend on the site of infection and the patient’s underlying disease. Sepsis with these organisms resem- bles gram-negative sepsis with other organisms, although the presence of ecthyma gangrenosum suggests the diagnosis. The diagnosis is made by culture. Pseudomonas infection should be suspected in neonates and neutropenic patients with clinical sepsis. A severe necrotizing pneumonia occurs in patients on ventilators. Patients with cystic fibrosis have a persistent bronchitis that progresses to bronchiectasis and ultimately to respira- tory failure. During exacerbations of illness, cough and sputum production increase with low-grade fever, malaise, and diminished energy. The purulent aural drainage without fever in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media is not distinguishable from that due to other causes.  Prevention A. Infections in Debilitated Patients Colonization of extensive second- and third-degree burns by P aeruginosa can lead to fatal septicemia. Aggressive debridement and topical treatment with 0.5% silver nitrate solution, 10% mafenide cream, or silver sulfadiazine will greatly inhibit P aeruginosa contamination of burns. (See Chapter 11 for a discussion of burn wound infections and prevention.) B. Nosocomial Infections Faucet aerators, communal soap dispensers, disinfectants, improperly cleaned inhalation therapy equipment, infant incubators, and many other sources that usually are associ- ated with wet or humid conditions all have been associated with Pseudomonas epidemics. Infant-to-infant transmission by nursery personnel carrying Pseudomonas on the hands is frequent in neonatal units. Careful maintenance of equip- ment and enforcement of infection control procedures are essential to minimize nosocomial transmission.   CHAPTER 40 1152 C. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis Chronic infection of the lower respiratory tract occurs in nearly all patients with cystic fibrosis. The infecting organism is seldom cleared from the respiratory tract, even with intensive antimicrobial therapy, and the resultant injury to the lung eventually leads to pulmonary insufficiency. Treat- ment is aimed at controlling signs and symptoms of the infection.  Treatment P aeruginosa is inherently resistant to many antimicrobials and may develop resistance during therapy. Mortality rates in hospitalized patients exceed 50%, owing both to the severity of underlying illnesses in patients predisposed to Pseudomonas infection and to the limitations of therapy. Antibiotics effective against Pseudomonas include the ami- noglycosides, ureidopenicillins (ticarcillin and piperacillin), β-lactamase inhibitor with a ureidopenicillin (ticarcillin– clavulanate and piperacillin–tazobactam), expanded-spec- trum cephalosporins (ceftazidime and cefepime), imipenem, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary from area to area, and resistance tends to appear as new drugs become popular. Treatment of infec- tions is best guided by clinical response and susceptibility tests. Gentamicin or tobramycin (5.0–7.5 mg/kg/d, given intra- muscularly or intravenously in three divided doses) or ami- kacin (15–22 mg/kg/d, given in two or three divided doses) in combination with ticarcillin (200–300 mg/kg/d, given intravenously in four to six divided doses) or with another antipseudomonal β-lactam antibiotic is recommended for treatment of serious Pseudomonas infections. Ceftazidime (150–200 mg/kg/d, given in four divided doses) or cefepime (150 mg/kg/d, given in three divided doses) has excellent activity against P aeruginosa. Treatment should be continued for 10–14 days. Treatment with two active drugs is recom- mended for all serious infections. Pseudomonas osteomyelitis due to punctures requires thorough surgical debridement and antimicrobial therapy for 2 weeks. Pseudomonas folliculitis does not require antibi- otic therapy. Oral or intravenous ciprofloxacin is also effective against susceptible P aeruginosa, but is not approved by the FDA for use in children except in the case of urinary tract infection. Nonetheless, in some circumstances of antimicrobial resis- tance, or when the benefits clearly outweigh the small risks, ciprofloxacin may be used. Chronic suppurative otitis media responds to intrave- nous ceftazidime (150–200 mg/kg/d in three or four divided doses) given until the drainage has ceased for 3 days. Twice- daily ceftazidime with aural debridement and cleaning given on an outpatient basis has also been successful. Swimmer’s ear may be caused by P aeruginosa and responds well to topical drying agents (alcohol–vinegar mix) and cleansing.  Prognosis Because debilitated patients are most frequently affected, the mortality rate is high. These infections may have a protracted course, and eradication of the organisms may be difficult. Iversen BG et al: An outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection caused by contaminated mouth swabs.

1174,Salmonella Gastroenteritis,Genetics & Dysmorphology ,3812,"SALMONELLA GASTROENTERITIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Nausea, vomiting, headache, meningismus.  Fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain.  Culture or organism from stool, blood, or other specimens.  General Considerations Salmonellae are gram-negative rods that frequently cause food-borne gastroenteritis and occasionally bacteremic infection of bone, meninges, and other foci. Three species— Salmonella typhi, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Salmonella enteritidis—and approximately 2000 serotypes are recog- nized. Salmonella typhimurium is the most frequently iso- lated serotype in most parts of the world. An estimated 4 million cases of salmonellosis occur yearly in the United States, but only 40,000 are reported. Salmonellae are able to penetrate the mucin layer of the small bowel and attach to epithelial cells. Organisms penetrate the epithelial cells and multiply in the submucosa. Infection results in fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea; the diarrhea occasionally includes mucus and polymorphonuclear neutro- phils in the stool. Although the small intestine is generally regarded as the principal site of infection, colitis also occurs. S typhimurium frequently involves the large bowel. Salmonella infections in childhood occur in two major forms: (1) gastroenteritis (including food poisoning), which may be complicated by sepsis and focal suppurative compli- cations; and (2) enteric fever (typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever) (see next section). Although the incidence of typhoid fever has decreased in the United States, the incidence of   CHAPTER 40 1154 bacteremia during the course of gastroenteritis should receive parenteral treatment initially, and a careful search should be made for additional foci of infection. After signs and symptoms subside, these patients should receive oral medication. Parenteral and oral treatment should last a total of 7–10 days. Longer treatment is indicated for specific complications. If susceptibility tests indicate resistance to ampicillin, third-generation cephalosporins or TMP–SMX should be given. Fluoroquinolones also are efficacious but are not approved for administration to children. Fluoroquinolones are used for strains resistant to multiple other drugs. Salmonella meningitis is best treated with ampicillin (200–300 mg/kg/d intravenously in four to six divided doses) and a third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) for 3 weeks. If the child improves rapidly and the CSF is sterile, treatment may be completed with a single drug, the choice guided by results of susceptibility tests. Outbreaks on pediatric wards are difficult to control. Strict hand washing, cohorting of patients and personnel, and ultimately closure of the unit may be necessary. B. Treatment of the Carrier State About half of patients may have positive stool cultures after 4 weeks. Infants tend to remain convalescent carriers for up to a year. Antibiotic treatment of carriers is not effective. C. General Measures Careful attention must be given to maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, especially in infants.  Prognosis In gastroenteritis, the prognosis is good. In sepsis with focal suppurative complications, the prognosis is more guarded. The case fatality rate of Salmonella meningitis is high in infants. There is a strong tendency to relapse if treatment is not continued for at least 14–21 days. Amieva MR: Important bacterial gastrointestinal pathogens in children: A pathogenesis perspective.

1176,Typhoid Fever & Paratyphoid Fever,Allergic Disorders ,2594,"TYPHOID FEVER & PARATYPHOID FEVER ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Insidious or acute onset of headache, anorexia, vomit- ing, constipation or diarrhea, ileus, and high fever.  Meningismus, splenomegaly, and rose spots.  Leukopenia; positive blood, stool, bone marrow, and urine cultures.  General Considerations Typhoid fever is caused by the gram-negative bacillus Salmo- nella typhi. Paratyphoid fevers, which are usually milder but may be clinically indistinguishable, are caused by Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella schottmülleri, or Salmonella hirschfeldii (formerly Salmonella paratyphi A, B, and C). Children have a shorter incubation period than do adults (usually 5–8 days instead of 8–14 days). The organism enters the body through the walls of the intestinal tract and, following a transient bacteremia, multiplies in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver and spleen. Persistent bacteremia and symptoms then follow. Reinfection of the intestine occurs as organisms are excreted in the bile. Bacterial emboli produce the character- istic skin lesions (rose spots). Symptoms in children may be mild or severe, but children younger than age 5 years rarely have severe typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and by contamination of food or water. Unlike other Salmonella species, there are no animal reservoirs of S typhi; each case is the result of direct or indirect contact with the organism or with an individual who is actively infected or a chronic carrier. About 250 cases per year are reported in the United States, 80% of which are acquired during foreign travel.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs In children, the onset of typhoid fever usually is sudden rather than insidious, with malaise, headache, crampy abdominal pains and distention, and sometimes constipa- tion followed within 48 hours by diarrhea, high fever, and toxemia. An encephalopathy may be seen with irritability, confusion, delirium, and stupor. Vomiting and meningis- mus may be prominent in infants and young children. The classic lengthy three-stage disease seen in adult patients often is shortened in children. The prodrome may last only 2–4 days, the toxic stage only 2–3 days, and the defervescence stage 1–2 weeks. During the prodromal stage, physical findings may be absent, or there may merely be some abdominal distention   CHAPTER 40 1156 Edino ST et al: Prognostic factors in typhoid ileal perforation: A prospective study of 53 cases.

1178,Shigellosis (Bacillary Dysentery),Allergic Disorders ,920,"SHIGELLOSIS (BACILLARY DYSENTERY) ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Cramps and bloody diarrhea.  High fever, malaise, convulsions.  Pus and blood in diarrheal stools examined microscop- ically.  Diagnosis confirmed by stool culture.  General Considerations Shigellae are nonmotile gram-negative rods of the family Enterobacteriaceae and are closely related to E coli. The genus Shigella is divided into four major groups, A–D, representing Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, and Shigella sonnei, respectively. Approximately 30,000 cases of shigellosis are reported each year in the United States. S sonnei followed by S flexneri are the most common isolates. S dysenteriae, which causes the most severe diarrhea of all species and the greatest number of extraintestinal complica- tions, accounts for less than 1% of all Shigella infections in the United States. Shigellosis may be a serious disease, particularly in young children, and without supportive treatment an appreciable mortality rate results. In older children and adults, the disease tends to be self-limited and milder. Shigella is usually transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Food- and water-borne outbreaks are increasing in occurrence, but are less impor- tant overall than person-to-person transmission. The disease is very communicable—as few as 200 bacteria can produce illness in an adult. The secondary attack rate in families is high, and shigellosis is a serious problem in day care centers and custodial institutions. Shigella organisms produce dis- ease by invading the colonic mucosa, causing mucosal ulcer- ations and microabscesses. A plasmid-encoded gene is required for enterotoxin production, chromosomal genes are required for invasiveness, and smooth lipopolysaccha- rides are required for virulence. An experimental vaccine is under development and is safe and immunogenic in young children.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The incubation period of shigellosis is usually 2–4 days. Onset is abrupt, with abdominal cramps, urgency, tenesmus, chills, fever, malaise, and diarrhea. Hallucinations and sei- zures sometimes accompany high fever. In severe forms, blood and mucus are seen in small stools (dysentery), and meningismus and convulsions may occur. In older children, the disease may be mild and may be characterized by watery diarrhea without blood. In young children, a fever of 39.4– 40°C is common. Rarely there is rectal prolapse. Symptoms generally last 3–7 days. B. Laboratory Findings The total WBC count varies, but often there is a marked shift to the left. The stool may contain gross blood and mucus, and many neutrophils are seen if mucus from the stool is examined microscopically. Stool cultures are usually posi- tive; however, they may be negative because the organism is somewhat fragile and present in small numbers late in the disease, and because laboratory techniques are suboptimal for the recovery of shigellae.  Differential Diagnosis Diarrhea due to rotavirus infection is a winter rather than a summer disease. Usually children with rotavirus infection are not as febrile or toxic as those with shigellosis, and in rotavirus infection, stool does not contain gross blood or neutrophils. Intestinal infections caused by Salmonella or Campylobacter are differentiated by culture. Grossly bloody stools in a patient without fever or stool leukocytes suggest E coli O157:H7 infection. Amebic dysentery is diagnosed by microscopic examination of fresh stools or sigmoidoscopy specimens. Intussusception is characterized by an abdominal mass (so-called currant jelly stools) without leukocytes, and by absence of fever. Mild shigellosis is not distinguishable clinically from other forms of infectious diarrhea.  Complications Dehydration, acidosis, shock, and renal failure are the major complications. In some cases, a chronic form of dysentery occurs, characterized by mucoid stools and poor nutrition. Bacteremia and metastatic infections are rare but serious complications. Febrile seizures are common. Fulminating fatal dysentery and hemolytic-uremic syndrome occur rarely.   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1157  Treatment A. Specific Measures Resistance to TMP–SMX (10 mg/kg/d trimethoprim and 50 mg/kg/d sulfamethoxazole, given in two divided doses orally for 5 days) is now commonly encountered in many communities and limits the use of this otherwise effective drug combination to cases where results of susceptibility testing are known. Amoxicillin is not effective. Ampicillin (100 mg/kg/d, given in four divided doses) is also effica- cious if the strain is sensitive. Parenteral ceftriaxone and oral cefixime are both effective; experience with other third-generation oral cephalosporins is limited. Azithro- mycin (12 mg/kg/d on day 1, then 6 mg/kg/d for 4 days) was superior to cefixime in one study. Ciprofloxacin (500 mg, given twice daily for 5 days) is efficacious in adults but is not approved for use in children. However, it may be used in children who remain symptomatic and in need of therapy, and when multiply resistant strains limit other preferred choices. Successful treatment reduces the dura- tion of fever, cramping, and diarrhea and terminates fecal excretion of Shigella. Tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also effective, but resistance is common. Presumptive ther- apy should be limited to children with classic shigellosis or known outbreaks. Afebrile children with bloody diarrhea are more commonly infected with EHEC. Antimicrobial therapy of EHEC may increase the likelihood of hemolytic- uremic syndrome. B. General Measures In severe cases, immediate rehydration is critical. A mild form of chronic malabsorption syndrome may supervene and require prolonged dietary control.  Prognosis The prognosis is excellent if vascular collapse is treated promptly by adequate fluid therapy. The mortality rate is high in very young, malnourished infants who do not receive fluid and electrolyte therapy. Convalescent fecal excretion of Shigella lasts 1–4 weeks in patients not receiving antimicro- bial therapy. Long-term carriers are rare. Ashkenazi S: Shigella infections in children: New insights.

1179,Cholera,Allergic Disorders ,2687,"CHOLERA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Sudden onset of severe watery diarrhea.  Persistent vomiting without nausea or fever.  Extreme and rapid dehydration and electrolyte loss, with rapid development of vascular collapse.  Contact with a case of cholera or with shellfish, or the presence of cholera in the community.  Diagnosis confirmed by stool culture.  General Considerations Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the gram- negative organism Vibrio cholerae. It is transmitted by con- taminated water or food, especially contaminated shellfish. Typical disease is generally so dramatic that in endemic areas the diagnosis is obvious. Individuals with mild illness and young children may play an important role in transmission of the infection. Asymptomatic infection is far more common than clini- cal disease. In endemic areas, rising titers of vibriocidal antibody are seen with increasing age. Infection occurs in individuals with low titers. The age-specific attack rate is highest in children younger than age 5 years and declines with age. Cholera is unusual in infancy. Cholera toxin is a protein enterotoxin that is primarily responsible for symptoms. Cholera toxin binds to a regula- tory subunit of adenylyl cyclase in enterocytes, causing increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate and an outpour- ing of NaCl and water into the lumen of the small bowel. Nutritional status is an important factor determining the severity of the diarrhea. Duration of diarrhea is prolonged in adults and children with severe malnutrition. Cholera is endemic in India and southern and Southeast Asia and in parts of Africa. The most recent pandemic, caused by the El Tor biotype of V cholerae 01, began in 1961 in Indonesia. Epidemic cholera spread in Central and South America, with a total of 1 million cases and 9500 deaths reported through 1994. Cases in the United States occurred in the course of foreign travel or as a result of consumption of contaminated imported food. Cholera is increasingly associated with consumption of shellfish. Interstate ship- ment of oysters has resulted in cholera in several inland states. Cholera is now rare in the United States with fewer than 10 cases per year reported. V cholerae is a natural inhabitant of shellfish and cope- pods in estuarine environments. Seasonal multiplication of V cholerae may provide a source of outbreaks in endemic areas. Chronic cholera carriers are rare. The incubation period is short, usually 1–3 days.   CHAPTER 40 1158  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Many patients infected with V cholerae have mild disease, with 1–2% developing severe diarrhea. During severe chol- era, there is a sudden onset of massive, frequent, watery stools, generally light gray in color (so-called rice-water stools) and containing some mucus but no pus. Vomiting may be projectile and is not accompanied by nausea. Within 2–3 hours, the tremendous loss of fluids results in life- threatening dehydration, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia, with marked weakness and collapse. Renal failure with ure- mia and irreversible peripheral vascular collapse will occur if fluid therapy is not administered. The illness lasts 1–7 days and is shortened by appropriate antibiotic therapy. B. Laboratory Findings Markedly elevated hemoglobin (20 g/dL) and marked acido- sis, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia are seen. Stool sodium concentration may range from 80–120 mEq/L. Cul- tural confirmation requires specific media and takes 16–18 hours for a presumptive diagnosis and 36–48 hours for a definitive bacteriologic diagnosis.  Prevention Cholera vaccine is available and provides 50% efficacy. Protection lasts 3–6 months. Cholera vaccine is not generally recommended for travelers. Tourists visiting endemic areas are at little risk if they exercise caution in what they eat and drink and maintain good personal hygiene. In endemic areas, all water and milk must be boiled, food protected from flies, and sanitary precautions observed. Simple filtration of water is highly effective in reducing cases. Thorough cooking of shellfish prevents transmission. All patients with cholera should be isolated. Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for household and other close contacts of cholera patients. It should be initiated as soon as possible after the onset of the disease in the index patient. Tetracycline (500 mg/d for 5 days) is effective in preventing infection. TMP–SMX may be substituted in children.  Treatment Physiologic saline or lactated Ringer solution should be administered intravenously in large amounts to restore blood volume and urine output and prevent irreversible shock. Potassium supplements are required. Sodium bicar- bonate, given intravenously, also may be needed initially to overcome profound metabolic acidosis from bicarbonate loss in the stool. Moderate dehydration and acidosis can be corrected in 3–6 hours by oral therapy alone, because the active glucose transport system of the small bowel is nor- mally functional. The optimal composition of the oral solu- tion (in mEq/L) is as follows: Na+, 90; Cl–, 80; and K+, 20 (with glucose, 110 mmol/L). Treatment with tetracycline (50 mg/kg/d orally in four divided doses for 2–5 days) or azithromycin (10 mg/kg/d in one dose for 1–5 days) shortens the duration of the disease in children and prevents clinical relapse but is not as important as fluid and electrolyte therapy. Tetracycline resistance occurs in some regions, and ciprofloxacin may be used depending on local resistance patterns. TMP–SMX should be used in children younger than age 9 years.  Prognosis With early and rapid replacement of fluids and electrolytes, the case fatality rate is 1–2% in children. If significant symptoms appear and no treatment is given, the mortality rate is over 50%. Ali M et al: Herd immunity conferred by killed oral cholera vaccines in Bangladesh: A reanalysis.

1180,Campylobacter,Allergic Disorders ,3774,"CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTION ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.  Presumptive diagnosis by darkfield or phase contrast microscopy of stool wet mount or modified Gram stain.  Definitive diagnosis by stool culture.  General Considerations Campylobacter species are small gram-negative, curved or spiral bacilli that are commensals or pathogens in many animals. Campylobacter jejuni frequently causes acute enteritis in humans. In the 1990s, C jejuni was responsible for 3–11% of cases of acute gastroenteritis in North America and Europe. In many areas, enteritis due to C jejuni is more common than that due to Salmonella or Shigella. Campylobacter fetus causes bacteremia and meningitis in immunocompromised patients. C fetus may cause maternal fever, abortion, stillbirth, and severe neonatal infection. Helicobacter pylori (previously called Campylobacter pylori) causes gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in both adults and children. (See Chapter 20.) Campylobacter colonizes domestic and wild animals, especially poultry. Numerous cases have been associated with sick puppies or other animal contacts. Contaminated food and water, improperly cooked poultry, and person-to- person spread by the fecal-oral route are common routes of   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1159 transmission. Outbreaks associated with day care centers, contaminated water supplies, and raw milk have been reported. Newborns may acquire the organism from their mothers at delivery.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs C jejuni enteritis can be mild or severe. In tropical countries, asymptomatic stool carriage is common. The incubation period is usually 1–7 days. The disease usually begins with sudden onset of high fever, malaise, headache, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Diarrhea follows and may be watery or bile-stained, mucoid, and bloody. The illness is self-limiting, lasting 2–7 days, but relapses occur in 15–25% of cases. Without antimicrobial treatment, the organism remains in the stool for 1–6 weeks. B. Laboratory Findings The peripheral WBC count generally is elevated, with many band forms. Microscopic examination of stool reveals eryth- rocytes and pus cells. Isolation of C jejuni from stool is not difficult but requires selective agar, incubation at 42°C rather than 35°C, and incubation in an atmosphere of about 5% oxygen and 5% CO2 (candle jar is satisfactory).  Differential Diagnosis Campylobacter enteritis may resemble viral gastroenteritis, salmonellosis, shigellosis, amebiasis, or other infectious diar- rheas. Because it also mimics ulcerative colitis, Crohn dis- ease, intussusception, and appendicitis, mistaken diagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgery.  Complications The most common complication is dehydration. Other uncommon complications include erythema nodosum, con- vulsions, reactive arthritis, bacteremia, urinary tract infec- tion, and cholecystitis. Guillain-Barré syndrome may follow C jejuni infection by 1–3 weeks.  Prevention No vaccine is available. Hand washing and adherence to basic food sanitation practices help prevent disease. Hand washing and cleaning of kitchen utensils after contact with raw poultry are important.  Treatment Treatment of fluid and electrolyte disturbances is important. Antimicrobial treatment with erythromycin in children (30– 50 mg/kg/d orally in four divided doses for 5 days), azithro- mycin for 5 days, or ciprofloxacin terminates fecal excretion. Fluoroquinolone-resistant C jejuni are now common world- wide. Therapy given early in the course of the illness will shorten the duration of symptoms but is unnecessary if given later. Antimicrobials used for shigellosis, such as TMP–SMX and ampicillin, are inactive against Campylobacter. Support- ive therapy is sufficient in most cases.  Prognosis The outlook is excellent if dehydration is corrected and misdiagnosis does not lead to inappropriate diagnostic or surgical procedures.

1181,Tularemia,Allergic Disorders ,3162,"TULAREMIA ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  A cutaneous or mucous membrane lesion at the site of inoculation and regional lymph node enlargement.  Sudden onset of fever, chills, and prostration.  History of contact with infected animals, principally wild rabbits, or history of tick exposure.  Positive culture or immunofluorescence from mucocu- taneous ulcer or regional lymph nodes.  High serum antibody titer.  General Considerations Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis, a gram-nega- tive organism usually acquired directly from infected ani- mals (principally wild rabbits) or by the bite of an infected tick. Occasionally infection is acquired from infected domestic dogs or cats; by contamination of the skin or mucous membranes with infected blood or tissues; by inhalation of infected material; by bites of fleas or deer flies that have been in contact with infected animals; or by ingestion of contaminated meat or water. The incubation period is short, usually 3–7 days, but may vary from 2–25 days. Ticks are the most important vector of tularemia and rabbits are the classic vector. It is important to seek a history of rabbit hunting, skinning, or food preparation in any patient who has a febrile illness with tender lymphadenopa- thy, often in the region of a draining skin ulcer.   CHAPTER 40 1160  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Several clinical types of tularemia occur in children. Sixty percent of infections are of the ulceroglandular form and start as a reddened papule that may be pruritic, quickly ulcerates, and is not very painful. Soon, the regional lymph nodes become large and tender. Fluctuance quickly follows. There may be marked systemic symptoms, including high fever, chills, weakness, and vomiting. Pneumonitis occasion- ally accompanies the ulceroglandular form or may be seen as the sole manifestation of infection (pneumonic form). A detectable skin lesion may be absent, and localized lymphoid enlargement may exist alone (glandular form). Oculoglan- dular and oropharyngeal forms also occur. The latter is characterized by tonsillitis, often with membrane formation, cervical adenopathy, and high fever. In the absence of a primary ulcer or localized lymphadenitis, a prolonged febrile disease reminiscent of typhoid fever can occur (typhoidal form). Splenomegaly is common in all forms. B. Laboratory Findings F tularensis can be recovered from ulcers, regional lymph nodes, and sputum of patients with the pneumonic form. However, the organism grows only on an enriched medium (blood-cystine-glucose agar), and laboratory handling is dangerous owing to the risk of airborne transmission to laboratory personnel. Immunofluorescent staining of biopsy material or aspirates of involved lymph nodes is diagnostic, although it is not widely available. The WBC count is not remarkable. Agglutinins are present after the second week of illness, and in the absence of a positive culture their development confirms the diag- nosis. An agglutination titer of 1:160 or higher is consid- ered positive.  Differential Diagnosis The typhoidal form of tularemia may mimic typhoid, brucel- losis, miliary tuberculosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and mononucleosis. Pneumonic tularemia resembles atypi- cal or mycotic pneumonitis. The ulceroglandular type of tularemia resembles pyoderma caused by staphylococci or streptococci, "
1182,Plague,Allergic Disorders ,2073,"plague, anthrax, and cat-scratch fever. The oropharyngeal type must be distinguished from streptococ- cal or diphtheritic pharyngitis, mononucleosis, herpangina, or other viral pharyngitides.  Prevention Children should be protected from insect bites, especially those of ticks, fleas, and deer flies, by the use of proper clothing and repellents. Because rabbits are the source of most human infections, the dressing and handling of such game should be performed with great care. If contact occurs, thorough washing with soap and water is indicated.  Treatment A. Specific Measures Historically, streptomycin was the drug of choice. Gentamicin and amikacin also are efficacious, more available, and familiar to clinicians. A 10-day course is usually sufficient; although more severe infections may need longer therapy. Doxycycline is effective, but relapse rates are higher. Doxycycline is not usually recommended for children younger than 8 years of age unless benefits of use outweigh the risk of dental staining. Ciprofloxa- cin also can be used in patients with less severe disease. Cipro- floxacin is not approved for children younger than 18 years, and is not usually recommended in children unless benefits out- weigh risks. Failures occur with ceftriaxone. B. General Measures Antipyretics and analgesics may be given as necessary. Skin lesions are best left open. Glandular lesions occasionally require incision and drainage.  Prognosis The prognosis is excellent in cases of tularemia that are recognized early and treated appropriately.

1184,Haemophilus influenzae Type B,Allergic Disorders ,954,"HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE  TYPE B INFECTIONS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Purulent meningitis in children younger than age 4 years with direct smears of CSF showing gram-nega- tive pleomorphic rods.  Acute epiglottitis: high fever, drooling, dysphagia, apho- nia, and stridor.  Septic arthritis: fever, local redness, swelling, heat, and pain with active or passive motion of the involved joint in a child 4 months to 4 years of age.  Cellulitis: sudden onset of fever and distinctive celluli- tis in an infant, often involving the cheek or periorbital area.  In all cases, a positive culture from the blood, CSF, or aspirated pus confirms the diagnosis.  General Considerations H influenzae type b (Hib) has become uncommon because of widespread immunization in early infancy. The 99% reduction in incidence seen in many parts of the United States is due to high rates of vaccine coverage and reduced nasopharyngeal carriage after vaccination. Forty percent of cases occur in children younger than 6 months who are too young to have completed a primary immunization series. Hib may cause meningitis, bacteremia, epiglottitis (supraglottic croup), septic arthritis, periorbital and facial cellulitis, pneumonia, and pericarditis. Disease due to H influenzae types A, C, D, E, F, or unencapsulated strains is rare, but it now accounts for a larger proportion of positive culture results. Third-genera- tion cephalosporins are preferred for initial therapy of Hib infections. Ampicillin is adequate for culture-proved Hib susceptible strains. Unencapsulated, nontypeable H influenzae frequently colonize the mucous membranes and cause otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia in children and adults. Bacteremia is uncommon. Neonatal sepsis similar to early- onset GBS is recognized. Obstetric complications of chorio- amnionitis and bacteremia are usually the source of neonatal cases. Ampicillin resistance occurs in 25–40% of nontypeable H influenzae.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Meningitis—Infants usually present with fever, irritabil- ity, lethargy, poor feeding with or without vomiting, and a high-pitched cry. 2. Acute epiglottitis—The most useful clinical finding in the early diagnosis of Hib epiglottitis is evidence of dyspha- gia, characterized by a refusal to eat or swallow saliva and by drooling. This finding, plus the presence of a high fever in a toxic child—even in the absence of a cherry-red epiglottis on direct examination—should strongly suggest the diagnosis and lead to prompt intubation. Stridor is a late sign. (See Chapter 18.) 3. Septic arthritis—Hib is a common cause of septic arthritis in unimmunized children younger than age 4 years in the United States. The child is febrile and refuses to move the involved joint and limb because of pain. Exami- nation reveals swelling, warmth, redness, tenderness on palpation, and severe pain on attempted movement of the joint. 4. Cellulitis—Cellulitis due to Hib occurs almost exclusively in children between the ages of 3 months and 4 years but is now uncommon as a result of immunization. Fever is usually noted at the same time as the cellulitis, and many infants appear toxic. The cheek or periorbital (preseptal) area is usually involved. B. Laboratory Findings The WBC count in Hib infections may be high or normal with a shift to the left. Blood culture is frequently positive. Positive culture of aspirated pus or fluid from the involved site proves the diagnosis. In untreated meningitis, CSF smear may show the characteristic pleomorphic gram-negative rods.   CHAPTER 40 1166 days. Ampicillin (100 mg/kg/d in four divided doses) may also be used for erythromycin-intolerant patients. Azithromycin is often preferred due to ease of compliance and decreased gastrointestinal side effects. Corticosteroids reduce the severity of disease but may mask signs of bacterial superinfection. Albuterol (0.3–0.5 mg/kg/d in four doses) has reduced the severity of illness, but tachycardia is common when the drug is given orally, and aerosol administration may precipitate paroxysms. B. General Measures Nutritional support during the paroxysmal phase is impor- tant. Frequent small feedings, tube feeding, or parenteral fluid supplementation may be needed. Minimizing stimuli that trigger paroxysms is probably the best way of controlling cough. In general, cough suppressants are of little benefit. C. Treatment of Complications Respiratory insufficiency due to pneumonia or other pulmo- nary complications should be treated with oxygen and assisted ventilation if necessary. Convulsions are treated with oxygen and anticonvulsants. Bacterial pneumonia or otitis media requires additional antibiotics.  Prognosis The prognosis for patients with pertussis has improved in recent years because of excellent nursing care, treatment of complications, attention to nutrition, and modern intensive care. However, the disease is still very serious in infants younger than age 1 year; most deaths occur in this age group. Children with encephalopathy have a poor prognosis.

1188,Listeriosis,Allergic Disorders ,2123,"LISTERIOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES Early-onset neonatal disease:  Signs of sepsis a few hours after birth in an infant born with fetal distress and hepatosplenomegaly; maternal fever. Late-onset neonatal disease:  Meningitis, sometimes with monocytosis in the CSF and peripheral blood.  Onset at age 9–30 days.  General Considerations Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, non–spore-form- ing aerobic rod distributed widely in the animal kingdom and in food, dust, and soil. It causes systemic infections in newborn infants and immunosuppressed older children. In pregnant women, infection is relatively mild, with fever, aches, and chills, but is accompanied by bacteremia and sometimes results in intrauterine or perinatal infection with grave consequences for the fetus or newborn. One fourth of cases occur in pregnant women, and 20% of their pregnancies end in stillbirth or neonatal death. Listeria is present in the stool of approximately 10% of the healthy population. Persons in contact with animals are at greater risk. Outbreaks of listeriosis have been traced to contami- nated cabbage in coleslaw, soft cheese, hot dogs, luncheon meats, and milk. Listeria infections have decreased since the adoption of strict regulations for ready-to-eat foods; fewer than 900 cases were reported in 2005. Like GBS infections, Listeria infections in the newborn can be divided into early and late forms. Early infections are more common, leading to a severe congenital form of infection. Later infections are often characterized by meningitis.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs In the early neonatal form, symptoms of listeriosis usually appear on the first day of life and always by the third day. Fetal distress is common, and infants frequently have signs of severe disease at birth. Respiratory distress, diarrhea, and fever occur. On examination, hepatosplenomegaly and a papular rash are found. A history of maternal fever is common. Meningitis may accompany the septic course. The late neonatal form usually occurs after age 9 days and can occur as late as 5 weeks. Meningitis is common, character- ized by irritability, fever, and poor feeding. Listeria infections are rare in older children and usually are associated with immunodeficiency. Several recent cases were associated with tumor necrosis factor-α neutralizing agents. Signs and symptoms are those of meningitis, usually with insidious onset. B. Laboratory Findings In all patients except those receiving white cell depressant drugs, the WBC count is elevated, with 10–20% monocytes. When meningitis is found, the characteristic CSF cell count is high (> 500/μL) with a predominance of polymorphonu-   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1167 clear neutrophils in 70% of cases. Monocytes may predomi- nate in up to 30% of cases. Gram-stained smears of CSF are usually negative, but short gram-positive rods may be seen. The chief pathologic feature in severe neonatal sepsis is miliary granulomatosis with microabscesses in liver, spleen, CNS, lung, and bowel. Culture results are frequently positive from multiple sites, including blood from the infant and the mother.  Differential Diagnosis Early-onset neonatal disease resembles hemolytic disease of the newborn, GBS sepsis or severe cytomegalovirus infec- tion, rubella, or toxoplasmosis. Late-onset disease must be differentiated from meningitis due to echovirus and cox- sackievirus, GBS, and gram-negative enteric bacteria.  Prevention Immunosuppressed, pregnant, and elderly patients can decrease the risk of Listeria infection by avoiding soft cheeses, by thoroughly reheating or avoiding delicatessen and ready-to-eat foods, by avoiding raw meat and milk, and by thoroughly washing fresh vegetables.  Treatment Ampicillin (150–300 mg/kg/d every 6 hours intravenously) is the drug of choice in most cases of listeriosis. Gentami- cin (2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours intravenously) has a synergis- tic effect with ampicillin and should be given in serious infections and to patients with immune deficits. Vancomy- cin may be substituted for ampicillin when empirically treating meningitis. If ampicillin cannot be used, TMP– SMX also is effective. Cephalosporins are not effective. Treatment of severe disease should continue for at least 2 weeks.  Prognosis In a recent outbreak of early-onset neonatal disease, the mortality rate was 27% despite aggressive and appropriate management. Meningitis in older infants has a good progno- sis. In immunosuppressed children, prognosis depends to a great extent on that of the underlying illness.

1189,Tuberculosis,Antimicrobial Therapy ,2604,"TUBERCULOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  All types: positive tuberculin test in patient or mem- bers of household, suggestive chest radiograph, his- tory of contact, and demonstration of organism by stain and culture.  Pulmonary: fatigue, irritability, and undernutrition, with or without fever and cough.  Glandular: chronic cervical adenitis.  Miliary: classic snowstorm appearance of chest radio- graph.  Meningitis: fever and manifestations of meningeal irritation and increased intracranial pressure. Charac- teristic CSF.  General Considerations Tuberculosis is a granulomatous disease caused by Myco- bacterium tuberculosis. It is a leading cause of death throughout the world. Children younger than age 3 years are most susceptible. Lymphohematogenous dissemina- tion through the lungs to extrapulmonary sites, including the brain and meninges, eyes, bones and joints, lymph nodes, kidneys, intestines, larynx, and skin, is more likely to occur in infants. Increased susceptibility occurs again in adolescence, particularly in girls within 2 years of menarche. Following substantial increases in disease dur- ing the 1980s, tuberculosis incidence has decreased since 1992 due to increased control measures. More than 10,000 new cases were reported in 2005. High-risk groups include ethnic minorities, foreign-born persons, prison- ers, residents of nursing homes, indigents, migrant work- ers, and health care providers. However, 50% of cases occurred in U.S.-born persons. HIV infection is an important risk factor for both development and spread of disease. Pediatric tuberculosis incidence mirrors the trends seen in adults. Exposure to an infected adult is the most common risk factor in children. The primary complex in infancy and childhood consists of a small parenchymal lesion in any area of the lung with caseation of regional nodes and calcification. Post-primary tuberculosis in adolescents and adults commonly occurs in the apices of the lungs and is likely to cause chronic progressive cavitary pulmo- nary disease with less tendency for hematogenous dissem- ination. Mycobacterium bovis infection is clinically identi- cal to M tuberculosis. M bovis may be acquired from unpasteurized dairy products obtained outside the United States.   CHAPTER 40 1170 4. Ethambutol—Because optic neuritis is the major side effect in adults, ethambutol has usually been given only to children whose vision can be reliably tested for loss of color differentiation. Optic neuritis is rare and usually occurs in those receiving more than the recommended dosage of 25 mg/ kg/d. Documentation of optic toxicity in children is lacking despite considerable worldwide experience. Therefore, many four-drug regimens for children now include ethambutol. 5. Streptomycin—Streptomycin (20–30 mg/kg/d, given intra- muscularly in one or two doses) should be given for 1 or 2 months in severe disease. The child’s hearing should be tested periodically during use as ototoxicity is common. B. Chemotherapy for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis The incidence of drug resistance is increasing and reaches 10–20% in some areas of the United States. Transmission of multiply drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains to contacts has occurred in some epidemics. Consultation with local experts in treating tuberculosis is important in these difficult cases. Therapy should continue for 12 months or longer. Often, four to six first- and second-line medica- tions are needed. C. General Measures Corticosteroids may be used for suppressing inflammatory reactions in meningeal, pleural, and pericardial tuberculosis and for the relief of bronchial obstruction due to hilar adenopathy. Prednisone is given orally, 1 mg/kg/d for 6–8 weeks, with gradual withdrawal at the end of that time. The use of corticosteroids may mask progression of disease. Accordingly, the clinician needs to be sure that an effective regimen is being used.  Prognosis If bacteria are sensitive and treatment is completed, most children are cured with minimal sequelae. Repeat treatment is more difficult and less successful. With antituberculosis chemotherapy (especially isoniazid), there should now be nearly 100% recovery in miliary tuberculosis. Without treat- ment, the mortality rate in both miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis is almost 100%. In the latter form, about two thirds of patients receiving treatment survive. There may be a high incidence of neurologic abnormalities among survivors if treatment is started late.

Strains of nontuber- culous mycobacteria are common in soil, food, and water. Organisms enter the host by small abrasions in skin, oral mucosa, or gastrointestinal mucosa. Strain cross-reactivity with M tuberculosis can be demonstrated by simultaneous skin testing (Mantoux) with PPD-S (standard) and PPD prepared from one of the atypical antigens. Unfortunately, reagents prepared for routine nontuberculosis skin testing are not available to clinicians. The Runyon classification of mycobacteria includes the following: Group I. Photochromogens (PPD-Y): (Mycobacterium kansasii, M marinum) Yellow color develops on exposure to light in previously white colony grown 2–4 weeks in the dark. Group II. Scotochromogens (PPD-G): (Mycobacterium scrofulaceum) Colonies are definitely yellow-orange after incubation in the dark. Organisms may be found in small numbers in the normal flora of some human saliva and gastric contents. Subclinical infection is widespread in the United States, but clinical disease appears rarely. Group III. Nonphotochromogens (PPD-B): “Battey avian- swine group” grows as small white colonies after incuba- tion in the dark, with no significant development of pig- ment on exposure to light.

1194,Legionella,Antimicrobial Therapy ,609,"LEGIONELLA INFECTION ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Severe progressive pneumonia in a child with compro- mised immunity.  Diarrhea and neurologic signs are common.  Positive culture requires buffered charcoal yeast extract media and proves infection.  Direct fluorescent antibody staining of respiratory secre- tions proves infection.  General Considerations Legionella pneumophila is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacil- lus that causes two distinct clinical syndromes: Legionnaire disease and Pontiac fever. Usually Legionnaire disease is an acute, severe pneumonia that is frequently fatal in immuno- compromised patients. Pontiac fever is a mild, flulike illness that spares the lungs and is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. The disease is self-limited and is described in outbreaks in otherwise healthy adults. Over 40 species of Legionella have been discovered, but not all cause disease in humans. L pneumophila causes most infec- tions. Legionella is present in many natural water sources as well as domestic water supplies (faucets and showers). Con- taminated cooling towers and heat exchangers have been implicated in several large institutional outbreaks. Person-to- person transmission has not been documented. Few cases of Legionnaire disease have been reported in children. Most were in children with compromised cellular immunity. In adults, risk factors include smoking, underlying cardiopulmonary or renal disease, alcoholism, and diabetes. L pneumophila is thought to be acquired by inhalation of a contaminated aerosol. The bacteria are phagocytosed but proliferate within macrophages. Cell-mediated immunity is necessary to activate macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Onset of fever, chills, anorexia, and headache is abrupt. Pulmonary symptoms appear within 2–3 days and progress rapidly. The cough is nonproductive early. Purulent sputum occurs late. Hemoptysis, diarrhea, and neurologic signs (including lethargy, irritability, tremors, and delirium) are seen. B. Laboratory Findings The WBC count is usually elevated. Chest radiographs show rapidly progressive patchy consolidation. Cavitation and large pleural effusions are uncommon. Cultures from spu- tum, tracheal aspirates, or bronchoscopic specimens, when grown on specialized media are positive in 70–80% of patients at 3–7 days. Direct fluorescent antibody staining of sputum or other respiratory specimens is only 50–70% sensitive but 95% specific. A negative result on culture or direct fluorescent antibody staining of sputum or tracheal secretions does not rule out disease due to Legionella. PCR detection of respiratory secretions for Legionella is available at some centers. A urine immunoassay for Legionella antigen is more sensitive than the immunoassay using respiratory secretions and is highly specific. Serologic tests are available, but a maximum rise in titer may require 6–8 weeks.  Differential Diagnosis Legionnaire disease is usually a rapidly progressive pneumo- nia in a patient who appears very ill with unremitting fevers. Other bacterial pneumonias, viral pneumonias, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and fungal disease are all possibilities and may be difficult to differentiate clinically in an immunocompro- mised patient.  Complications In sporadic untreated cases, mortality rates are 5–25%. In immunocompromised patients with untreated disease, mor- tality approaches 80%. Hematogenous dissemination may result in extrapulmonary foci of infection, including pericar- dium, myocardium, and kidneys. Legionella may be the cause of culture-negative endocarditis.  Prevention No vaccine is available. Hyperchlorination and periodic superheating of water supplies in hospitals have been shown to reduce the number of organisms and the risk of infection.  Treatment Intravenous azithromycin, 10 mg/kg/d given as a once-daily dose (maximum dose 500 mg), is the drug of choice. Rifampin (20 mg/kg/d divided in two doses) may be added to the regimen in gravely ill patients. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are effective in adults but are not approved for use in children. Duration of therapy is 5–10 days if azithro- mycin is used; for other antibiotics a 14–21-day course is recommended. Oral therapy may be substituted for intrave- nous therapy as the patient’s condition improves.   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1173  Prognosis Mortality rate is high if treatment is delayed.

PSITTACOSIS (ORNITHOSIS) & CHLAMYDIA PNEUMONIAE INFECTION ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fever, cough, malaise, chills, headache.  Diffuse rales; no consolidation.  Long-lasting radiographic findings of bronchopneumonia.  Isolation of the organism or rising titer of complement- fixing antibodies.  Exposure to infected birds (ornithosis).  General Considerations Psittacosis is caused by Chlamydia psittaci. When the agent is transmitted to humans from psittacine birds (parrots, para- keets, cockatoos, and budgerigars), the disease is called psittacosis or parrot fever. However, other avian genera (eg, pigeons and turkeys) are common sources of infection in the United States, and the general term ornithosis often is used. The agent is an obligate intracellular parasite. Human-to- human spread rarely occurs. The incubation period is 5–14 days. The bird from which the disease was transmitted may not be clinically ill. Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause atypical pneumonia similar to that due to M pneumoniae. Transmission is by respiratory spread. Infection appears to be most prevalent during the second decade; half of surveyed adults are sero- positive. Only a small percentage of infections result in clinical pneumonia. The disease may be more common than atypical pneumonia due to M pneumoniae. Lower respira- tory tract infection due to C pneumoniae is uncommon in infants and young children.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. C psittaci—The disease is extremely variable but tends to be mild in children. The onset is rapid or insidious, with fever, chills, headache, backache, malaise, myalgia, and dry cough. Signs include pneumonitis, altered percussion notes and breath sounds, and rales. Pulmonary findings may be absent early. Dyspnea and cyanosis may occur later. Spleno- megaly, epistaxis, prostration, and meningismus are occa- sionally seen. Delirium, constipation or diarrhea, and abdominal distress may occur. 2. C pneumoniae—Clinically, C pneumoniae infection is similar to M pneumoniae infection. Most patients have mild upper respiratory infections. Lower respiratory tract infec- tion is characterized by fever, sore throat (perhaps more severe with C pneumoniae), cough, and bilateral pulmonary findings and infiltrates. B. Laboratory Findings 1. C psittaci—In psittacosis, the WBC count is normal or decreased, often with a shift to the left. Proteinuria is common. C psittaci is present in the blood and sputum during the first 2 weeks of illness and can be isolated by inoculation of specimens into mice or embryonated eggs, but culture is available only in research laboratories. A fourfold rise in complement fixation titers in specimens obtained at least 2 weeks apart or a single titer above 1:32 is considered evidence of infection. The titer rise may be blunted or delayed by therapy. Infection with C pneumoniae may lead to diagnostic confusion because cross-reactive antibody may cause falsely positive C psittaci titers. Micro- immunofluorescence and PCR assays are specific but usually not available for C psittaci. 2. C pneumoniae—A fourfold rise in IgG titer (microim- munofluorescence antibody test) or an IgM titer above 1:16 is evidence of infection. IgG antibody peaks 6–8 weeks after infection. C pneumoniae can be isolated from nasal wash or throat swab specimens after inoculation into cell culture. A PCR assay also is available. C. Imaging The radiographic findings in psittacosis are those of central pneumonia that later becomes widespread or migratory. Psittacosis is indistinguishable from viral pneumonias by radiograph. Signs of pneumonitis may appear on radio- graph in the absence of clinical suspicion of pulmonary involvement.  Differential Diagnosis Psittacosis can be differentiated from viral or mycoplasmal pneumonias only by the history of contact with potentially infected birds. In severe or prolonged cases with extrapulmo- nary involvement the differential diagnosis is broad, includ- ing typhoid fever, brucellosis, and rheumatic fever.  Complications Complications of psittacosis include myocarditis, endocardi- tis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and secondary bacterial pneumo- nia. C pneumoniae infection may be prolonged or may recur. "

PSITTACOSIS (ORNITHOSIS) & CHLAMYDIA PNEUMONIAE INFECTION ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Fever, cough, malaise, chills, headache.  Diffuse rales; no consolidation.  Long-lasting radiographic findings of bronchopneumonia.  Isolation of the organism or rising titer of complement- fixing antibodies.  Exposure to infected birds (ornithosis).  General Considerations Psittacosis is caused by Chlamydia psittaci. When the agent is transmitted to humans from psittacine birds (parrots, para- keets, cockatoos, and budgerigars), the disease is called psittacosis or parrot fever. However, other avian genera (eg, pigeons and turkeys) are common sources of infection in the United States, and the general term ornithosis often is used. The agent is an obligate intracellular parasite. Human-to- human spread rarely occurs. The incubation period is 5–14 days. The bird from which the disease was transmitted may not be clinically ill.

1196,Cat-Scratch Disease,Antimicrobial Therapy ,756,"CAT-SCRATCH DISEASE ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  History of a cat scratch or cat contact.  Primary lesion (papule, pustule, or conjunctivitis) at site of inoculation.  Acute or subacute regional lymphadenopathy.  Aspiration of sterile pus from a node.  Laboratory studies excluding other causes.  Biopsy of node or papule showing histopathologic findings consistent with cat-scratch disease and occa- sionally characteristic bacilli on Warthin-Starry stain.  Positive cat-scratch serology (antibody to Bartonella henselae).  General Considerations The causative agent of cat-scratch disease is Bartonella hense- lae, a gram-negative bacillus that also causes bacillary angio- matosis. Cat-scratch disease is a benign, self-limited form of lymphadenitis. Patients often report a cat scratch (67%) or contact with a cat or kitten (90%). The cat almost invariably is healthy. The clinical picture is that of a regional lymphadenitis associated with an erythematous papular skin lesion without intervening lymphangitis. The disease occurs worldwide and is more common in the fall and winter. It is estimated that more than 20,000 cases per year occur in the United States. The most common systemic complication is encephalitis.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs About 50% of patients with cat-scratch disease develop a pri- mary lesion at the site of the wound. The lesion usually is a papule or pustule that appears 3–10 days after injury and is located most often on the arm or hand (50%), head or leg (30%), or trunk or neck (10%). The lesion may be conjunctival (10%). Regional lymphadenopathy appears 10–50 days later and may be accompanied by mild malaise, lassitude, headache, and fever. Multiple sites are seen in about 10% of cases. Involved nodes may be hard or soft and 1–6 cm in diameter. They are usually tender, and 10–20% of them suppurate. The overlying skin may be inflamed. Lymphadenopathy usually resolves in about 2 months but may persist for up to 8 months. Unusual manifestations include erythema nodosum, thrombocytopenic purpura, conjunctivitis (Parinaud ocu- loglandular fever), parotid swelling, pneumonia, osteolytic lesions, mesenteric and mediastinal adenitis, neuroretinitis, peripheral neuritis, hepatitis, granulomata of the liver and spleen, and encephalitis. Immunocompetent patients may develop an atypical sys- temic form of cat-scratch disease. These patients have pro- longed fever, fatigue, and malaise. Lymphadenopathy may be present. Hepatosplenomegaly or low-density hepatic or splenic lesions visualized by ultrasound or computed tomog- raphy scan are seen in some patients. Infection in immunocompromised individuals may take the form of bacillary angiomatosis, presenting as vascular tumors of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Immunocom- promised patients may also have bacteremia or infection of the liver (peliosis hepatis). B. Laboratory Findings Serologic evidence of Bartonella infection by indirect fluores- cent antibody or ELISA with a titer above 1:64 is supportive of the diagnosis. PCR assays are available. Cat-scratch skin test antigens are not recommended. Histopathologic examination of involved tissue may show pyogenic granulomas or bacillary forms demonstrated by Warthin-Starry silver stain. There usually is some eleva- tion in the ESR. In patients with CNS involvement, the CSF is usually normal but may show a slight pleocytosis and modest elevation of protein.  Differential Diagnosis Cat-scratch disease must be distinguished from pyogenic aden- itis, tuberculosis (typical and atypical), tularemia, plague, bru- cellosis, lymphoma, primary toxoplasmosis, infectious mono- nucleosis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and fungal infections.  Treatment Treatment of cat-scratch disease adenopathy is controversial because the disease usually resolves without therapy and the patient is typically not exceedingly ill. Treatment of typical cat- scratch disease with a 5-day course of azithromycin has been shown to speed resolution of lymphadenopathy in some patients. The best therapy is reassurance that the adenopathy is benign and will subside spontaneously with time (mean dura- tion of illness is 14 weeks). In cases of nodal suppuration, needle aspiration under local anesthesia relieves the pain. Excision of the   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1175 involved node is indicated in cases of chronic adenitis. In some reports, azithromycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or TMP–SMX have been useful. Azithromycin is used by many experts if treatment of adenopathy is desired because it is given once a day, is reasonably priced, and was studied in one random- ized placebo-controlled trial. In that trial, lymph node volume decreased faster than placebo by 1 month; there was no differ- ence in long-term resolution in the azithromycin and placebo groups. Immunocompromised patients with evidence of infection should be treated with antibiotics: long-term therapy (months) in these patients with azithromycin, erythromycin, or doxycy- cline often is needed to prevent relapses. Immunocompetent patients with more severe disease or evidence of systemic infec- tion should also be treated with antibiotics.  Prognosis The prognosis is good if complications do not occur.

Acquired:  Chancre of genitals, lip, or anus in child or adolescent.  History of sexual contact.  General Considerations Syphilis is a chronic, generalized infectious disease caused by a spirochete, Treponema pallidum. In the acquired form, the disease is transmitted by sexual contact. Primary syphilis is characterized by the presence of an indurated painless chan- cre, which heals in 7–10 days. A secondary eruption involv- ing the skin and mucous membranes appears in 4–6 weeks. After a long latency period, late lesions of tertiary syphilis involve the eyes, skin, bones, viscera, CNS, and cardiovascu- lar system. Congenital syphilis results from transplacental infection. Infection may result in stillbirth or produce illness in the newborn, in early infancy, or later in childhood. Syphilis occurring in the newborn and young infant is comparable to secondary disease in the adult but is more severe and life- threatening. Late congenital syphilis (developing in child- hood) is comparable to tertiary disease. Congenital syphilis is increasing in the United States due to increasing primary and secondary syphilis in women of childbearing age, and perhaps due to inadequate diagnosis and treatment of syphilis in prenatal care programs.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Congenital Syphilis a. Newborns—Most newborns with congenital syphilis are asymptomatic. If infection is not detected and treated, symp- toms develop within weeks to months. When clinical signs are present, they usually consist of jaundice, anemia with or without thrombocytopenia, increase in nucleated red blood cells, hepatosplenomegaly, and edema. Overt signs of menin- gitis (bulging fontanelle or opisthotonos) may be present, but subclinical infection with CSF abnormalities is more likely. b. Young infants (3–12 weeks)—The infant may appear normal for the first few weeks of life only to develop mucocutaneous lesions and pseudoparalysis of the arms or legs. Shotty lymphadenopathy may be felt. Hepatomegaly is universal, with splenomegaly in 50% of patients. Other signs of disease similar to those seen in the newborn may be present. Anemia has been reported as the only presenting manifestation of congenital syphilis in this age group. “Snuf- fles” (syphilitic rhinitis), characterized by a profuse mucopu- rulent discharge, are present in 25% of patients. A syphilitic rash is common on the palms and soles but may occur anywhere on the body. The rash consists of bright red, raised maculopapular lesions that gradually fade. Moist lesions occur at the mucocutaneous junctions (nose, mouth, anus, and genitals) and lead to fissuring and bleeding.

Syphilis of more than 1 year’s duration (late latent disease)—Syphilis of more than 1 year’s duration (without evidence of neurosyphilis) requires weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin G therapy for 3 weeks. CSF examina- tion and VDRL test should be done on all children and patients with coexisting HIV infection or neurologic symp- toms. In addition, patients who have failed treatment or who were previously treated with an agent other than penicillin need a CSF examination and CSF VDRL. 4. Neurosyphilis—Aqueous crystalline penicillin G is rec- ommended, 200,000–300,000 units/kg/d in four to six divided doses, given intravenously for 10–14 days. The maximum adult dose is 4 million units per dose. This regimen should possibly be followed by an intramuscular course of benzathine G penicillin, 50,000 units/kg given once a week for 3 consecu- tive weeks, to a maximum dose of 2.4 million units. B. General Measures Penicillin treatment of early congenital or secondary syphilis may result in a dramatic systemic febrile illness termed the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Treatment is symptomatic, with careful follow-up. Transfusion may be necessary in infants with severe hemolytic anemia.  Prognosis Severe disease, if undiagnosed, may be fatal in the newborn. Complete cure can be expected if the young infant is given penicillin. Serologic reversal usually occurs within 1 year. Treatment of primary syphilis with penicillin is curative.

1200,Relapsing Fever,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,2132,"RELAPSING FEVER ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Episodes of fever, chills, malaise.  Occasional rash, arthritis, cough, hepatosplenomegaly, conjunctivitis.  Diagnosis confirmed by direct microscopic identifica- tion of spirochetes in smears of peripheral blood.  General Considerations Relapsing fever is a vector-borne disease caused by spiro- chetes of the genus Borrelia. Epidemic relapsing fever is transmitted to humans by body lice (Pediculus humanus) and endemic relapsing fever by soft-bodied ticks (genus Ornithodoros). Tick-borne relapsing fever is endemic in the western United States. Although several hundred cases are reported per year, substantial underdiagnosis occurs. Trans- mission usually takes place during the warm months, when ticks are active and recreation or work brings people into contact with Ornithodoros ticks. Infection is often acquired in mountain camping areas and cabins. The ticks are noctur- nal feeders and remain attached for only 5–20 minutes. Consequently, the patient seldom remembers a tick bite. Rarely, neonatal relapsing fever results from transplacental transmission of Borrelia. Both louse-borne and tick-borne relapsing fever may be acquired during foreign travel.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The incubation period is 4–18 days. The attack is sudden, with high fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, bronchitis, and a dry, nonpro- ductive cough. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly appear later. Meningeal irritation may be present. An erythematous rash may be seen over the trunk and extremities, and petechiae may be present. After 3–10 days, the fever falls. Jaundice, iritis, conjunctivitis, cranial nerve palsies, and hemorrhage occur more commonly during relapses. The disease is characterized by relapses at intervals of 1– 2 weeks and lasting 3–5 days. The relapses duplicate the initial attack but become progressively less severe. In louse- borne relapsing fever, there is usually a single relapse. In tick- borne infection, two to six relapses occur. B. Laboratory Findings During febrile episodes, the patient’s urine contains protein, casts, and occasionally erythrocytes; a marked polymorpho- nuclear leukocytosis is present; and about 25% of patients have a false-positive serologic test for syphilis. Examination of the peripheral blood smear is the diagnostic test of choice. Spirochetes can be found in the peripheral blood by direct microscopy in approximately 70% of cases by darkfield examination or by Wright, Giemsa, or acridine orange stain- ing of thick and thin smears. Spirochetes are not found during afebrile periods. Immunofluorescent antibody (or ELISA confirmed by Western blot) can sometimes help establish the diagnosis serologically. However, high titers of Borrelia hermsii can cross-react with Borrelia burgdorferi (the   INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL & SPIROCHETAL 1179 agent in Lyme disease) in immunofluorescent antibody assay, ELISA, and Western blots. Serologic specimens can be sent to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO 80522.  Differential Diagnosis Relapsing fever may be confused with malaria, "

CNS involvement occurs in 10–30% of patients.  Treatment For children younger than age 8 years who have tick-borne relapsing fever, standard dosages of penicillin or erythromy- cin should be given for 10 days. Older children may be given doxycycline. Chloramphenicol is also efficacious and was often used in the past. Severely ill patients should be hospitalized. Patients may experience a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (usually noted in the first few hours after commencing antibiotics). Isolation precau- tions are not necessary for relapsing fever. Contact precautions are recommended for patients with louse infestations.  Prognosis The mortality rate in treated cases of relapsing fever is very low, except in debilitated or very young children. With treatment, the initial attack is shortened and relapses pre- vented. The response to antimicrobial therapy is dramatic.

LEPTOSPIROSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Biphasic course lasting 2–3 weeks.  Initial phase: high fever, headache, myalgia, and conjunctivitis.  Apparent recovery for 2–3 days.  Return of fever associated with meningitis.  Jaundice, hemorrhages, and renal insufficiency (severe cases).  Culture of organism from blood and CSF (early) and from urine (later), or direct microscopy of urine or CSF.  Positive leptospiral agglutination test.  General Considerations Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by many antigenically distinct but morphologically similar spirochetes. The organ- ism enters through the skin or respiratory tract. Classically the severe form (Weil disease), with jaundice and a high mortality rate, was associated with infection with Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae after immersion in water contaminated with rat urine. It is now known that a variety of animals (eg, dogs, rats, and cattle) may serve as reservoirs for pathogenic Leptospira, that a given serogroup may have multiple animal species as hosts, and that severe disease may be caused by many different serogroups. In the United States, leptospirosis usually occurs after contact with dogs. Cattle, swine, or rodents may transmit the organism. Sewer workers, farmers, abattoir workers, animal handlers, and soldiers are at risk for occupational exposure. Outbreaks have resulted from swimming in contaminated streams and harvesting field crops. In the United States, about 100 cases are reported yearly, about one third of them in children.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Initial phase—The incubation period is 4–19 days (mean, 10 days). Chills, fever, headache, myalgia, conjunctivitis (episcleral injection), photophobia, cervical lymphadenopa- thy, and pharyngitis commonly occur. The initial lepto- spiremic phase lasts for 3–7 days. 2. Phase of apparent recovery—Symptoms typically (but not always) subside for 2–3 days. 3. Systemic phase—Fever reappears and is associated with headache, muscular pain and tenderness in the abdomen and back, and nausea and vomiting. Lung, heart, and joint involvement occasionally occurs. These manifestations are due to extensive vasculitis. a. Central nervous system involvement—The CNS is involved in 50–90% of cases. Severe headache and mild nuchal rigidity are usual, but delirium, coma, and focal neurologic signs may be seen. b. Renal and hepatic involvement—In about 50% of cases, the kidney or liver is affected. Gross hematuria and oliguria or anuria is sometimes seen. Jaundice may be associated with an enlarged and tender liver.   1183 41 Infections: Parasitic & Mycotic Samuel R. Dominguez, MD, PhD Adriana Weinberg, MD Myron J. Levin, MD "
1205,Parasitic Infections,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,111,"PARASITIC INFECTIONS Parasitic diseases are common and may present clinically in a variety of ways (Table 41–1). Although travel to endemic areas suggests particular infections, many are transmitted through fomites or acquired from contact with human carriers and can occur anywhere. Some of the less common parasitic infections and those seen primarily in the developing world are presented in abbreviated form in Table 41–2. Selection of Patients for Evaluation The incidence of parasitic infections varies greatly with geographic area. Children who have traveled or lived in areas where parasitic infections are endemic are at risk for infection with a variety of intestinal and tissue parasites. Children who have resided only in developed countries are usually free of tissue parasites (except Toxoplasma). Searching for intestinal parasites is expensive for the patient and time-consuming for the laboratory. More than 90% of ova and parasite examinations performed in most hospital laboratories in the United States are nega- tive; many have been ordered inappropriately. An ap- proach to determining which children with diarrhea need such examinations is presented in Figure 41–1. It can be more cost-effective to treat symptomatic U.S. immigrants with albendazole or nitazoxanide, broad-spectrum anti- parasitic drugs, and to investigate only those whose symp- toms persist. Immunodeficient children are very susceptible to proto- zoal intestinal infections. Multiple opportunists are fre- quently identified, and the threshold for ordering tests should be low for these children. Specimen Processing For tissue parasites, contact the laboratory for proper collec- tion procedures. Diarrheal stools may contain trophozoites that die rapidly during transport. The specimen should be either examined immediately or placed in a stool fixative such as polyvinyl alcohol. Fixative vials for home collection of stool are available. They may contain toxic compounds, so they should be stored safely. Fixed specimens are stable at room temperature. Formed stools usually contain cysts that are more stable. It is also best to fix these after collection, although they may be reliably examined after transport at room temperature. Eosinophilia & Parasitic Infections Although some parasites commonly cause eosinophilia, in developed countries other causes are much more common and include allergies, drugs, and other infections. Heavy intestinal nematode infections cause eosinophilia; they are easily detected on a single ova and parasite examination. Light nematode infections and common protozoal infections—giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, and amebiasis—rarely cause eosinophilia. Eosinophilia is also unusual or minimal in more serious infec- tions such as amebic liver abscess and malaria. The most common parasitic infection in the United States that causes significant eosinophilia with negative stool examination is toxocariasis. In a young child with unex- plained eosinophilia and a negative stool examination, a serologic test for Toxocara may be the next appropriate test. Trichinosis is a rare cause of marked eosinophilia; strongy- loidiasis is a cause of eosinophilia that may be difficult to diagnose with stool examinations. The differential diagnosis of eosinophilia is broad for patients who have been in developing countries (see Table 41–1).  Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

1212,Babesiosis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1506,"Babesiosis Babesia microti is a malaria-like protozoan that infects and lyses erythrocytes of wild and domestic animals in North America and Europe. In the United States, human babesi- osis has been identified in the coastal areas of New England, northern California and Washington State, and in the lakes region of the upper Midwest. Humans acci- dentally enter the cycle when bitten by Ixodes scapularis (deer tick), one of the intermediate hosts and vectors of B microti. After inoculation, the protozoan penetrates the erythrocytes and starts an asynchronous cycle that causes hemolysis.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The incubation period is 1–3 weeks but may extend up to 6 weeks. Many times the tick bite is unnoticed. Symptoms are nonspecific and include sustained or cyclic fever up to 40°C, shaking chills, malaise, myalgias, headache, and dark urine. Hepatosplenomegaly is an uncommon finding. The disease is usually self-limited, but severe cases have been described in asplenic patients and immunocompromised hosts. Because they share a common vector, physicians should consider the possibility of coinfection with Borrelia burgdorferi or Ana- plasma phagocytophilum in any patient diagnosed with Babe- sia infection.

The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstrating high antibody titers in aque- ous fluid. Congenital infection is documented by anti-Toxoplasma IgM or IgA antibodies in the blood of the neonate. Prenatal diagnosis of congenital infection requires a combination of ultrasonography (to detect ventricle enlargement) and amni- otic fluid PCR or cord blood serology. Amniotic fluid PCR is highly sensitive and carries fewer risks than cord puncture.  Differential Diagnosis Congenital toxoplasmosis must be differentiated from cyto- megalovirus infection, rubella, herpes simplex infection, syphilis, Lyme disease, listeriosis, erythroblastosis, and the encephalopathies that accompany degenerative diseases. Acquired infection mimics viral, bacterial, or lymphoprolif- erative disorders.  Prevention Pregnant women and immunocompromised patients should wash hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, cook meat to 66°C or greater, wash fruits and vegetables before con- sumption, and avoid contact with cat feces. Serologic screen- ing of pregnant women is warranted in areas of high preva- lence. A first test should be performed by 10–12 weeks of pregnancy. Seronegative patients should be retested at 20–22 weeks’ gestation and near term. Seroconverters require spe- cific therapy.  Treatment Treatment does not reverse central nervous system (CNS) damage in neonates, but does markedly decrease late seque- lae. A year of treatment is recommended for all congenitally infected infants; symptomatic patients receive 6 months of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, followed by alternating spiramycin and pyrimethamine–sulfadiazine monthly for the next 6 months. Subclinical infection is treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for 6 weeks, followed by alternating spiramycin for 6 weeks with pyrimethamine– sulfadiazine for 4 weeks. Oral pyrimethamine at 1 mg/kg/d (maximum, 25 mg) causes gastrointestinal upset, leukopenia, thrombocytope- nia, and rarely, agranulocytosis. Frequent blood counts should be performed to guide therapy. Leucovorin calcium (folinic acid), 5 mg given intramuscularly every 3 days, decreases myelotoxicity. The dosage of sulfadiazine is 40–45 mg/kg twice a day orally (maximum, 8 g/d). Clindamycin can be substituted for sulfadiazine in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides. Spiramycin and trimethoprim–sulfa- methoxazole are less active. Since acquired infection is usually self-limited, the poten- tially toxic therapy should be prescribed with discretion when the illness is uncomplicated. In chorioretinitis, antimicrobial therapy (pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine) is used for 4 weeks. A course of corticoster- oids (prednisone, 1.5 mg/kg up to 75 mg) is recommended when lesions involve the macula or the optic nerve. Lesions tend to improve after 10 days of therapy. In primary infection during pregnancy, spiramycin is started immediately. Pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine, alter- nating every 3 weeks with spiramycin, are used when fetal infection has been documented. Montoya JG et al: Diagnosis and management of toxoplasmosis.

An estimated 10% of the world’s population is infected with E histolytica or Entamoeba dispar, and an estimated 100,000 people die of amebic infection each year. Amebiasis should be suspected in patients with a history of travel to, or contact with individu- als who may be asymptomatic carriers from, endemic areas. In the United States, amebiasis may occur in homes for the handicapped, where poor hygiene fosters the spread of enteric pathogens. E histolytica has been found in the stools of as many as 30% of homosexual men. Individuals of any age may be infected. Transmission is usually fecal-oral, often from asymptomatic carriers who pass cysts. Trophozoites are killed by stomach acid and are not infectious.

Paromomycin, a nonab- sorbable aminoglycoside, can be used safely during preg- nancy and has only mild intestinal side effects, including flatulence and increased number of stools. Diloxanide furoate is relatively nontoxic and used widely outside the United States. The treatment of invasive amebiasis requires metronidazole. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like effect and should be avoided in patients receiving ethanol-contain- ing medications. Tinidazole, a more potent nitroimidazole against amebic infection, can be used for shorter treatment courses and is well tolerated in children. In patients who cannot tolerate metronidazole or tinida- zole, erythromycin and tetracycline are active against intesti- nal trophozoites, but are inactive against trophozoites in liver abscesses. Conversely, chloroquine is active only against hepatic amebiasis. Treatment of invasive amebiasis should always be followed with an intraluminal cysticidal agent, even if the stool examination is negative. Metronidazole and paromomycin should not be given concurrently, because the diarrhea that is a common side effect of paromomycin may make it difficult to assess response to therapy. Patients with large, thin-walled hepatic abscesses may need therapeutic aspiration to avoid abscess rupture. Patients with amebiasis should be placed under enteric precautions.

1221,Giardiasis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1759,"Giardiasis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Chronic relapsing diarrhea, flatulence, bloating, anorexia, poor weight gain.  Absence of fever and hematochezia.  Detection of trophozoites, cysts, or Giardia antigens in stool.  General Considerations Giardiasis, caused by Giardia lamblia, is the most common intestinal protozoal infection in children in the United States and in most of the world. Endemic worldwide, the infection is classically associated with drinking contaminated water, either in rural areas or in areas with faulty purification systems. But even ostensibly clean urban water supplies can be contaminated intermittently. Persons have acquired the infection in swimming pools. Fecal-oral contamination allows person-to-person spread. Day care centers have become a major source of infection, with an incidence of up to 50% reported in some centers. No symptoms occur in 25% of infected persons, facilitating spread to household contacts. Food-borne outbreaks also occur. Although infec- tion is rare in neonates, giardiasis may occur at any age.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Giardia infection is followed by asymptomatic cyst passage, acute self-limited diarrhea, or a chronic syndrome of diar- rhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. Acute diarrhea occurs 1–2 weeks after infection and is characterized by abrupt onset of diarrhea with greasy, malodorous stools; malaise; flatulence; bloating; and nausea. Fever and vomiting occur in a minority of patients. Urticaria, reactive arthritis, biliary tract disease, gastric infection, and constipation have occa- sionally been reported. The disease has a protracted course (> 1 week) and frequently leads to weight loss. Patients who develop chronic diarrhea complain of profound malaise, lassitude, headache, and diffuse abdominal pain in associa- tion with bouts of diarrhea—most typically foul-smelling, greasy stools—intercalated with periods of constipation or normal bowel habits. This syndrome can persist for months until specific therapy is administered or until it subsides spontaneously. Chronic diarrhea frequently leads to malab- sorption, steatorrhea, vitamin A and vitamin B12 deficiencies, and disaccharidase depletion.

B. Laboratory Findings The diagnosis of giardiasis relies on finding the parasite in stool or duodenal aspirates or detecting Giardia antigen in feces. For ova and parasite examination, a fresh stool pro- vides the best results. Liquid stools have the highest yield of trophozoites, which are more readily found on wet mounts. With semiformed stools, the examiner should look for cysts in fresh or fixed specimens, preferably using a concentration technique. When these techniques are applied carefully, one examination has a sensitivity of 50–70%; three examinations increase the sensitivity to 90%. Giardia antigen detection by means of immunofluorescence ELISAs, nonenzymatic im- munoassays, and direct fluorescence antibody tests are be- coming the standard diagnostic tests in the United States. They are comparable in cost to a stool ova and parasite examination, have a more rapid return of results, and are 85– 90% sensitive and 95–100% specific. With a careful stool ova and parasite examination or with the use of a new antigen test, direct sampling of the duodenal contents should be restricted to particularly difficult cases. Three methods are currently available: the string test (Entero-Test), duodenal aspiration, and duodenal biopsy.  Prevention The prevention of giardiasis requires proper treatment of water supplies and interruption of person-to-person trans- mission. Travelers to developing countries or wilderness areas should halogenate or boil (for over 10 minutes) drink- ing water and avoid uncooked foods that might have been washed with contaminated water. Sexual transmission is prevented by avoiding oral-anal and oral-genital sex. Inter- rupting fecal-oral transmission requires strict hand washing. However, outbreaks of diarrhea in day care centers might be particularly difficult to eradicate, and reinforcing hand- washing and treating the disease in both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers may be necessary.  Treatment Metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide are the drugs of choice for treatment of giardiasis. When given at 5 mg/kg (up to 250 mg) three times a day for 5 days, metronidazole has 80–95% efficacy. The drug is well tolerated in children. It has a disulfiram-like effect and should be avoided in patients receiving ethanol-containing medication. Metronidazole can be administered safely during pregnancy. Tinidazole has an efficacy approaching 90% when given as a single dose of 50 mg/kg (up to 2 g). Nitazoxanide is available in liquid formu- lation and requires only 3 days of treatment. Recommended doses are 100 mg (5 mL) every 12 hours for children 12–47 months of age and 200 mg (10 mL) for 4- to 11-year-olds. Furazolidone is sometimes used in children because it is available in suspension. Administered at 1.5 mg/kg (up to 100 mg) four times daily for 7–10 days, it has only 80% efficacy. Furazolidone may cause gastrointestinal side effects, turn urine red, and cause mild hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. For patients who do not respond to ther- apy, or who suffer relapse, a second course with the same drug or switching to another drug is equally effective. In cases of repeated treatment failure, albendazole (400 mg/d for 5–10 days), although not specifically recommended in the United States for the treatment of giardiasis, is an effective option.

1222,Cryptosporidiosis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,3571,"Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan that has gained importance because it causes severe diarrhea in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in other immunodeficient persons. The parasite is ubiq- uitous and infects and reproduces in the epithelial cell lining of the digestive and respiratory tracts of humans and most other vertebrate animals. Humans acquire the infection from contaminated water supplies, including swimming pools and lake water, or from close contact with infected humans or animals.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Immunocompetent persons infected with Cryptosporidium usually develop self-limited diarrhea (2–26 days) with or without abdominal cramps. Diarrhea is intermittent and scant or continuous, watery, and voluminous. Low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and malaise may accompany the diarrhea. Children younger than age 2 years appear more susceptible to infection than older children. Immunocompromised patients (either cellular or humoral deficiency) tend to develop prolonged disease, which usually subsides only after the immunodeficiency is corrected. Other clinical manifestations associated with cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised hosts include cholecystitis, pancreati- tis, hepatitis, and respiratory symptoms. B. Laboratory Findings Cryptosporidiosis has no characteristic laboratory features other than identification of the microorganism in feces or on biopsy. ELISA and PCR tests are more sensitive than staining of stool specimens or concentrates.  Prevention & Treatment Prevention of Cryptosporidium infection is limited by oocyst resistance to some of the standard water purification proce-   CHAPTER 41 1202 However, in the presence of a documented case, it is advisable to close the implicated lake to swimming.

Ascariasis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Abdominal cramps and discomfort.  Large, white or reddish, round worms, or ova in the feces.  General Considerations Together with the whipworm and hookworms (see below), Ascaris comprises the group of so-called “soil-transmitted helminths.” This group of parasites causes human infection through contact with eggs or larvae that thrive in the moist soil of the tropics and subtropics. Worldwide more than a billion people are infected with one species of these parasites, and especially in less developed countries, it is not uncom- mon for children to be chronically infected with all three worms. Children infected with these worms are at increased risk for malnutrition, stunted growth, intellectual retarda- tion, and cognitive and education deficits. Together, the soil- transmitted helminths are one of the world’s most important causes of physical and intellectual growth retardation. Ascaris lumbricoides is a worldwide human parasite. Ova passed by carriers may remain viable for months under the proper soil conditions. The ova contaminate food or fingers and are subsequently ingested by a new host. The larvae hatch, penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the venous system, reach the alveoli, are coughed up, and return to the small intestine, where they mature. The female lays thousands of eggs daily.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Infections usually remain asymptomatic; severe cases, how- ever, can be associated with pain, weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, or vomiting. Adult worms may be seen in feces or vomitus. Rarely, they perforate or obstruct the small bowel, biliary system, or appendix. Large numbers of larvae migrat- ing through the lungs may cause an acute, transient eosino- philic pneumonia (Löffler syndrome). B. Laboratory Findings The diagnosis is made by observing the large roundworms (1.5–4 cm) in the stool or by microscopic detection of the ova.  Treatment Because the adult worms live less than a year, asymptomatic infection need not be treated. Mebendazole (100 mg twice a day for 3 days or 500 mg once), pyrantel pamoate (a single dose of 11 mg/kg; maximum, 1 g), and albendazole (400 mg in a single dose, or 200 mg in children 1–2 years of age) are highly and equally effective. In cases of intestinal or biliary obstruction, piperazine (150 mg/kg initially, followed by six doses of 65 mg/kg every 12 hours by nasogastric tube) is recommended because it narcotizes the worms and helps relieve obstruction. However, surgical removal is occasion- ally required. Bethony J et al: Soil-transmitted helminth infections: Ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm. Lancet 2006;367:1521 [PMID: 16679166]. 3. Trichuriasis (Whipworm) Trichuris trichiura is a widespread human and animal para- site common in children living in warm, humid areas condu- cive to survival of the ova. The adult worms live in the cecum and colon; the ova are passed and become infectious after several weeks in the soil. Ingested infective eggs hatch in the upper small intestine. Unlike Ascaris, Trichuris does not have a migratory tissue phase. Symptoms are not present unless the infection is severe, in which case pain, diarrhea, and mild abdominal distention are present. Massive infections may also cause rectal prolapse and dysentery. Detection of the characteristic barrel-shaped ova in the feces confirms the diagnosis. Adult worms may be seen in the prolapsed rectum or at proctoscopy; their thin heads are buried in the mucosa, and the thicker posterior portions protrude. Mild to moder- ate eosinophilia may be present. Mebendazole (100 mg orally twice a day for 3 days or 500 mg once) or albendazole (400 mg in a single dose for 3 days, or 200 mg in children 1–2 years of age) improves gastrointes- tinal symptoms and terminates constitutional symptoms.

Hookworm ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Iron deficiency anemia.  Abdominal discomfort, weight loss.  Ova in the feces.  General Considerations The common human hookworms are Ancylostoma duode- nale and Necator americanus. Both are widespread in the tropics and subtropics. The larger A duodenale is more pathogenic because it consumes more blood, up to 0.5 mL per worm per day.  CHAPTER 41 1204 The adults live in the jejunum. Eggs are passed in the feces and develop and hatch into infective larvae in warm, damp soil within 2 weeks. The larvae penetrate human skin on contact, enter the blood, reach the alveoli, are coughed up and swal- lowed, and develop into adults in the intestine. The adult worms attach with their mouth parts to the mucosa, from which they suck blood. Blood loss is the major sequela of infection. Infec- tion rates reach 90% in areas without sanitation. A separate species, A braziliense (dog or cat hookworm), causes creeping eruption (cutaneous larva migrans). This disease occurs mainly on the warm-water American coasts.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs The larvae usually penetrate the skin of the feet and cause intense local itching (ground itch). This subsides as the larvae continue their migration. Löffler syndrome may supervene during lung migration. In creeping eruption, the nonhuman Ancylostoma larvae migrate blindly in the skin before dying, creating serpiginous burrows. Mild intestinal infections produce no symptoms. Severe infections cause iron deficiency anemia and malnutrition. Occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhea may be observed. B. Laboratory Findings The large ova of both species of hookworm are found in feces and are indistinguishable. Microcytic anemia, hypoalbumin- emia, eosinophilia, and hematochezia occur in severe cases.  Prevention Fecal contamination of soil and skin contact with potentially contaminated soil should be avoided.  Treatment A. Specific Measures Albendazole (400 mg orally in a single dose, or 200 mg in children 1–2 years of age), mebendazole (100 mg orally twice a day for 3 days), and pyrantel pamoate (11 mg/kg, to a maximum of 1 g, daily for 3 days) are the drugs of choice. Topical thiabendazole or albendazole or oral thiabendazole are useful for creeping eruption. B. General Measures Iron therapy may be as important as worm eradication.  Prognosis The outcome is usually excellent.

Strongyloidiasis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Abdominal pain, diarrhea.  Eosinophilia.  Larvae in stools and duodenal aspirates.  Serum antibodies.  General Considerations Strongyloides stercoralis is unique in having both parasitic and free-living forms; the latter can survive in the soil for several generations. The parasite is found in most tropical and sub- tropical regions of the world. The adults live in the submu- cosal tissue of the duodenum and occasionally elsewhere in the intestines. Eggs deposited in the mucosa hatch rapidly; the first-stage (rhabditiform) larvae, therefore, are the predomi- nant form found in duodenal aspirates and feces. The larvae mature rapidly to the tissue-penetrating filariform stage and initiate internal autoinfection. The filariform larvae also inhabit the soil and can penetrate the skin of another host, subsequently migrating into veins and pulmonary alveoli, reaching the intestine when coughed up and swallowed. Older children and adults are infected more often than are young children. Even low worm burden can result in signifi- cant clinical symptoms. Infestations due to poor sanitation and hygiene are noteworthy. Immunosuppressed patients may develop fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis, known as the hyperinfection syndrome.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs At the site of skin penetration, a pruritic rash may occur. Large numbers of migrating larvae can cause wheezing, cough, and hemoptysis. Although one third of intestinal infections are asymptomatic, the most prominent features of strongyloidiasis include abdominal pain, distention, diar- rhea, vomiting, and occasionally malabsorption. Patients with cellular immunodeficiencies and those on corticosteroid therapy may develop disseminated infection involving the intestine, the lungs, and the meninges. Gram- negative sepsis may complicate disseminated strongyloidiasis. B. Laboratory Findings Finding larvae in the feces, in duodenal aspirates, on a string test (Entero-Test), or in sputum is diagnostic. IgG antibodies measured by ELISA or immunoblot are sensitive and specific for Strongyloides. These persist after successful therapy. Marked eosinophilia is common.  INFECTIONS: PARASITIC & MYCOTIC 1205  Differential Diagnosis Strongyloidiasis should be differentiated from peptic disease, celiac disease, regional or tuberculous enteritis, hookworm infection, and other causes of intestinal symptoms or malab- sorption. The pulmonary phase may mimic asthma or bron- chopneumonia. Patients with severe infection can present with an acute abdomen.  Prevention & Treatment Thiabendazole (50 mg/kg/d in two doses for 2 days; maxi- mum, 3 g/d) and ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg/d for 1 or 2 days) are the drugs of choice. Relapses are common. In the hyperinfection syndrome, 2–3 weeks of therapy may be necessary. Patients from endemic areas should be tested for specific antibodies and receive treatment before undergoing immunosuppression.

Visceral Larva Migrans (Toxocariasis) ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Visceral involvement including hepatomegaly, marked eosinophilia, and anemia.  Posterior or peripheral ocular inflammatory mass.  Elevated antibody titers in serum or aqueous fluid; demonstration of Toxocara larvae in biopsy specimen.  General Considerations Visceral larva migrans is a worldwide disease. The agent is the cosmopolitan intestinal ascarid of dogs and cats, Toxo- cara canis or Toxocara cati. The eggs passed by infected animals contaminate parks and other areas that young chil- dren frequent. Children with pica are at increased risk. In the United States, seropositivity ranges from 2.8% in unselected populations to 23% in southern states to 54% in rural areas. Ingested eggs hatch and penetrate the intestinal wall, then migrate to the liver, lungs, eyes, and other organs, where they die and incite a granulomatous inflammatory reaction.  Clinical Findings A. Visceral Larva Migrans Toxocariasis is usually asymptomatic, but young children (aged 1–5 years) sometimes present with anorexia, fever, fatigue, pallor, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, nau- sea, vomiting, and cough. Hepatomegaly is common, sple- nomegaly is unusual, and adenopathy is absent. Lung involvement, usually asymptomatic, can be demonstrated readily by radiologic examination. Seizures are common, but more severe neurologic abnormalities are infrequent. Eosin- ophilia with leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver func- tion tests are typical laboratory findings. ELISA is sensitive, specific, and useful in confirming the clinical diagnosis. Most patients recover spontaneously, but disease may last up to 6 months. B. Ocular Larva Migrans This condition occurs in older children and adults who present with a unilateral posterior or peripheral inflamma- tory mass. History of visceral larva migrans and eosinophilia are typically absent. Anti-Toxocara antibody titers are low in the serum and high in vitreous and aqueous fluids. C. Diagnostic Findings Hypergammaglobulinemia and elevated isohemagglutinins sometimes result from cross-reactivity between Toxocara antigens and human group A and B blood antigens. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding larvae in granulomatous lesions. Positive serology in high titers and the exclusion of other causes of hypereosinophilia allow a presumptive diag- nosis to be made in typical cases.  Differential Diagnosis Diseases associated with hypereosinophilia must be consid- ered. These include trichinosis (enlarged liver not common; muscle tenderness common), eosinophilic leukemia (rare in children; eosinophils are abnormal in appearance), collagen- vascular disease (those associated with eosinophilia are rare in young children), strongyloidiasis (no organomegaly; enteric symptoms are common), early ascariasis, tropical eosino- philia (occurring mainly in India), allergies, and hypersensi- tivity syndromes.  Prevention & Treatment A. Specific Measures The clinical benefit of specific anthelmintic therapy is not defined. Treatment with albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 5 days) or mebendazole (100–200 mg twice a day for 5 days) is indicated for severe complications of brain, lung, or heart. B. General Measures Treating any cause of pica, such as iron deficiency, is impor- tant. Corticosteroids are used to treat marked inflammation of lung, eye, or other organs. Pets should be dewormed routinely. Other children in the household may be infected. Mild eosinophilia and positive serologic tests may be the only clue to their infection. Therapy is not necessary for these individuals.  CHAPTER 41 1206 7. Trichinosis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Vomiting, diarrhea, and pain within 1 week of eating infected meat.  Fever, periorbital edema, myalgia, and marked eosin- ophilia.  General Considerations Trichinella spiralis is a small roundworm that inhabits hogs and several other meat-eating animals. The human cycle begins with ingestion of viable larvae in undercooked meat. In the intestine, the larvae develop into adult worms that mate and produce hundreds of larvae. The larvae enter the bloodstream and migrate to the striated muscle where they continue to grow and eventually encyst. Symptoms are caused by the inflammatory response in the intestines or muscle.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Most infections are asymptomatic. The initial bowel pene- tration may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps within 1 week after ingestion of contaminated meat. This may progress to the classic myopathic form, which consists of fever, periorbital edema, myalgia, and weakness. Many organs may be infected by the migrating larvae: diaphragm, heart, lungs, kidneys, spleen, skin, and brain. Severe cerebral involvement may be fatal. Myocarditis may also be severe or fatal. Symptoms usually peak after 2–3 weeks, but may last months. Children typically have milder clinical and labora- tory findings than adults. B. Laboratory Findings Marked eosinophilia is the rule. Serology confirms the diag- nosis. Muscle biopsy is rarely necessary.  Differential Diagnosis The classic symptoms are pathognomonic if one is aware of this disease. It has to be distinguished from dermatomyositis, typhoid fever, sinusitis, influenza with myopathy, and angio- neurotic edema.  Prevention Because a microscopic examination must be performed, meat in the United States is not inspected for trichinosis. Although all states require the cooking of hog swill, hog-to- hog or hog-to-rat cycles may continue. All pork and sylvatic meat (eg, bear or walrus) should be heated to at least 65°C. Freezing meat to at least –15°C for 3 weeks may also prevent transmission. Animals used for food should not be fed or allowed access to raw meat.  Treatment Mebendazole has activity against the intestinal, circulating, and tissue stages of infection. The adult dose is 200–400 mg three times a day for 3 days followed by 400–500 mg three times a day for 10 days. Pediatric dosing has not been stand- ardized and recommendations range from 5–25 mg/kg/d divided in three doses for 14 days. Concurrent corticoster- oids are used in an attempt to prevent the Herxheimer reaction associated with treatment.  Prognosis Death may occur within the first weeks, but most infections are self-limited.

Raccoon Roundworm Infections ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis or encephalopathy.  Ocular larva migrans.  Contact with raccoons or raccoon feces.  General Considerations Human infections with Baylisascaris procyonis, the raccoon roundworm, have been increasingly recognized, particu- larly in children. The definitive host of this ascarid is the raccoon. Humans who ingest the eggs excreted in raccoon feces become intermediate hosts when the larvae penetrate the gut and disseminate via the bloodstream to the brain, eyes, viscera, and muscles. Young age, pica, and exposure to raccoon feces (eg, while camping) represent the main risk factors for this infection. Most of the infections are asymp- tomatic, but cases of severe encephalitis (neural larva migrans) and endophthalmitis (ocular larva migrans) occur. Symptoms typically begin 2–4 weeks after inocula- tion. CNS infections characteristically present as acute, rapidly progressive encephalitis with eosinophilic pleocyto- sis of the CSF. Both CNS and ocular infections resemble other larva migrans infections such as toxocariasis; there- fore B procyonis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these infections when Toxocara serology is negative. The diagnosis of B procyonis is established by "

Taeniasis & Cysticercosis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Mild abdominal pain; passage of worm segments (taeniasis).  Focal seizures, headaches (neurocysticercosis).  Cysticerci present in biopsy specimens, on plain films (as calcified masses), or on CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging.  Proglottids and eggs in feces; specific antibodies in serum or CSF.  General Considerations Both the beef tapeworm (Taenia saginata) and the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) cause taeniasis. The adults live in the intestines of humans; the egg-laden distal segments, or proglottids, break off and are passed in feces, disinte- grating and releasing the ova in the soil. After ingestion in food or water by cattle or pigs, the eggs hatch and the larvae migrate to and encyst in skeletal muscle. Encysted larvae in meat ingested by humans mature into adult tapeworms. Humans can be an intermediate host for T solium (but not T saginata), and the larvae released from ingested eggs encyst in a variety of tissues, especially muscle and brain. Full larval maturation occurs in 2 months, but the cysts cause little inflammation until they die months to years later. Inflammatory edema ensues with calcification or disappear- ance of the cyst. A slowly expanding mass of sterile cysts at the base of the brain may cause obstructive hydrocephalus (racemose cysticercosis). Both parasites are distributed worldwide. Contamination of foods by eggs in human feces allows infection without exposure to meat or travel to endemic areas. Asymptomatic cases are common, but neurocysticercosis is a leading cause of seizures in endemic areas. Person-to-person spread may occur, resulting in infec- tion of individuals with no exposure to infected meat.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Taeniasis—In most tapeworm infections, the only clini- cal manifestation is the passage of fecal proglottids, which are white, motile bodies 1–2 cm in size. They occasionally crawl out onto the skin and down the leg, especially the larger T saginata. Children may harbor the adult worm for years and complain of abdominal pain, anorexia, and diarrhea. 2. Cysticercosis—Most cases are asymptomatic. Subcutane- ous nodules of 1–2 cm may be the only sign. After several years, the cysticerci calcify and appear as radiographic opac- ities. Brain cysts may remain silent or cause seizures, head- ache, hydrocephalus, and basilar meningitis. Rarely, the spinal cord is involved. Neurocysticercosis manifests an average of 5 years after exposure, but may cause symptoms in the first year of life. In the eye, cysts cause bleeding, retinal detachment, and uveitis. Definitive diagnosis requires histo- logic demonstration of larvae or cyst membrane. Presump- tive diagnosis is often made by the characteristics of the cysts seen on CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging; the differ- ential diagnosis may include tuberculoma, brain abscess, arachnoid cyst, and tumor. The presence of T solium eggs in feces is uncommon, but supports the diagnosis. B. Laboratory Findings Eggs or proglottids may be found in feces or on the perianal skin (using the tape method employed for pinworms). Eggs of both Taenia species are identical. The species are identi- fied by examination of proglottids. Peripheral eosinophilia is minimal or absent. CSF eosin- ophilia is seen in 10–75% of cases of neurocysticercosis; its presence supports an otherwise presumptive diagnosis. ELISA antibody titers are eventually positive in up to 98% of serum specimens and over 75% of CSF specimens from patients with neurocysticercosis. Solitary cysts are associated with seropositivity less often than are multiple cysts. High titers tend to correlate with more severe disease. CSF titers are higher if cysts are near the meninges.  Treatment A. Taeniasis Praziquantel (5–10 mg/kg once) and albendazole are equally effective. Feces free of segments or ova for 3 months suggest cure. B. Cysticercosis Specific treatment is reserved for patients with meningitis, or enhancing or cystic parenchymal lesions. In contrast, those with inactive disease require only symptomatic treatment (anticon- vulsants). Albendazole, 15 mg/kg/d (maximum, 800 mg)  CHAPTER 41 1208 divided in two doses daily for 8 days, is the treatment of choice. Larval death may result in clinical worsening because of inflam- matory edema. A short course of dexamethasone may decrease these symptoms. Giant subarachnoidal cysts may require more than one cycle of therapy or surgery (or both). Follow-up scans every several months help assess the response to therapy. Treat- ment of patients with calcified lesions and seizure disorder results in a decrease of generalized seizures.  Prevention The incidence in the United States is low because beef and pork are inspected for taeniasis. Prevention requires proper cooking of meat, careful washing of raw vegetables and fruits, treatment of intestinal carriers, avoiding the use of human excrement for fertilizer, and providing proper sanitary facilities.  Prognosis The prognosis is good in intestinal taeniasis. Symptoms associated with a few cerebral cysts may disappear in a few months; heavy brain infections may cause death or chronic neurologic impairment.

Hymenolepiasis Hymenolepis nana, the cosmopolitan human tapeworm, is a common parasite of children; Hymenolepis diminuta, the rat tapeworm, is rare. The former is capable of causing autoin- fection. Larvae hatched from ingested eggs penetrate the intestinal wall and then reenter the lumen to mature into adults. Their eggs are immediately infectious for the same or a new host. The adult is only a few centimeters long. Finding the characteristic eggs in feces is diagnostic. H diminuta has an intermediate stage in rat fleas and other insects; children are infected when they ingest these insects. Light infections with either tapeworm are usually asymp- tomatic; heavy infection can cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. Therapy is with praziquantel (25 mg/kg once). 3. Echinococcosis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Cystic tumors of liver, lung, kidney, bone, brain, and other organs.  Eosinophilia.  Urticaria and pruritus if cysts rupture.  Protoscoleces or daughter cysts in the primary cyst.  Positive serology.  Epidemiologic evidence of exposure  General Considerations Dogs, cats, and other carnivores are the hosts for Echinococ- cus granulosus. Cystic and alveolar echinococcosis (hydatid disease) cause significant morbidity and mortality world- wide. Endemic areas include Australia, New Zealand, and the southwestern United States, including Native American res- ervations where shepherding is practiced. The adult tape- worm lives in sheep intestines, and eggs are passed in the feces. When ingested by humans, the eggs hatch, and the larvae penetrate the intestinal mucosa and disseminate in the bloodstream to produce cysts; the primary sites of involve- ment are the liver (60–70%) and the lungs (20–25%). A unilocular cyst is most common. Over years, the cyst may reach 25 cm in diameter, although most are much smaller. The cysts of Echinococcus multilocularis are multilocular and demonstrate more rapid growth.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Clinical disease is due to pressure from the enlarging cysts, vessel erosion, and sensitization to cyst or worm antigens. Liver cysts present as slowly expanding tumors that may cause biliary obstruction. Most are in the right lobe and extend inferiorly; 25% are on the upper surface and may be asymptomatic for years. Omental torsion or hemorrhage from vessel erosion may occur. Rupture of a pulmonary cyst causes coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, urticaria, chest pain, and hemoptysis; cyst and worm remnants are found in sputum. Brain cysts may cause focal neurologic signs and convulsions; renal cysts cause pain and hematuria; bone cysts cause pain. B. Laboratory Findings Presumptive diagnosis is made by a combination of radio- graphic or ultrasonographic and serologic findings. ELISA, which is the method most widely used for antibody testing, is highly sensitive, but has limited specificity. Confirmation may be obtained by ultrasonography- guided fine-needle aspiration coupled with parasitologic examination for protoscoleces, rostellar hooks, antigens, or DNA. Eosinophilia is variable and may be absent. Serologic tests are useful for diagnosis and follow-up of therapy. C. Imaging Pulmonary or bone cysts may be visible on plain films. Other imaging techniques are preferred for cysts in other "
1231,Trematode Infections,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1771,"TREMATODE INFECTIONS Schistosomiasis ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Transient pruritic rash after exposure to fresh water.  Fever, urticaria, arthralgias, cough, lymphadenitis, and eosinophilia.  Weight loss, anorexia, hepatosplenomegaly.  Hematuria, dysuria.  Eggs in stool, urine, or rectal biopsy specimens.  General Considerations One of the most common serious parasitic diseases, schisto- somiasis, is caused by several species of Schistosoma flukes. Schistosoma japonicum, S mekongi, and S mansoni involve the intestines and S haematobium, the urinary tract. The first two species are found in eastern and southeastern Asia; S man- soni in tropical Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America; and S haematobium in northern Africa. Infection is caused by free-swimming larvae (cercariae), which emerge from the intermediate hosts, certain species of freshwater snails. The cercariae penetrate human skin, migrate to the liver, and mature into adults, which then migrate through the portal vein to lodge in the bladder veins (S haematobium), superior mesenteric veins (S mekongi and S japonicum), or inferior mesenteric veins (S mansoni). Clinical disease results primarily from inflammation caused by the many eggs that are laid in the perivascular tissues or that embolize to the liver. Escape of ova into bowel or bladder lumen allows microscopic visualization and diagnosis from stool or urine specimens, as well as contamination of fresh water and infection of the snail hosts that ingest them.  Clinical Findings Much of the population in endemic areas is infected but asymptomatic. Only heavy infections produce symptoms. A. Symptoms and Signs The cercarial penetration may cause a pruritic rash; larval migra- tion may cause fever, urticaria, and cough; the maturation phase may cause tender hepatosplenomegaly followed by days to weeks of fever and malaise as the worms migrate to their final destina- tion. Bladder infection results in dysuria, hematuria, reflux, stones, and incontinence. Secondary pyelonephritis and ureteral obstruction may occur. Intestinal infection is usually asymptom- atic. The final stages of disease caused by the parasite in mesen- teric veins are characterized by hepatic fibrosis, portal hyperten- sion, splenomegaly, ascites, and bleeding from esophageal varices. The chronic inflammation in the urinary tract associated with S haematobium infections may result in obstructive uropa- thy, stones, infection, bladder cancer, fistulas, and anemia due to chronic hematuria. Spinal cord granulomas and paraplegia due to egg embolization into the Batson plexus have been reported. B. Laboratory Findings The diagnosis is made by finding the species-specific eggs in feces (S japonicum, S mekongi, S mansoni, and occasionally S haematobium) or urine (S haematobium and occasionally S mansoni). If no eggs are found, concentration methods should be used. A rectal biopsy may reveal S mansoni and should be   CHAPTER 41 1210 done if other specimens are negative. Peripheral eosinophilia is common, and eosinophils may be seen in urine.  Prevention The best prevention is to avoid contact with contaminated fresh water in endemic areas. Efforts to destroy the snail hosts have been successful in areas of accelerated economic development.  Treatment A. Specific Measures Praziquantel is the treatment of choice for schistosomiasis. A dosage of 40 mg/kg/d in two divided doses (S mansoni or S haematobium) or 20 mg/kg three times in 1 day (S japonicum or S mekongi) is very effective and nontoxic. Praziquantel has no effect on eggs and immature worms and therefore a repeat dose 4–6 weeks later is sometimes needed. Oxamniquine (20 mg/kg/d in two doses once per day) is an alternative regimen for treatment of S mansoni infection. Artemether (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) may prevent new infections or reinfection after curative treatment. B. General Measures Therapy of nutritional deficiency or secondary bacterial infec- tions may be needed. The patient’s urinary tract should be evaluated carefully in S haematobium infection; reconstructive surgery may be needed. Hepatic fibrosis requires careful eval- uation of the portal venous system and surgical management of portal hypertension when appropriate.  Prognosis Therapy decreases the worm burden and liver size, despite continued exposure in endemic areas. Early disease responds well to therapy, but once significant scarring or severe inflam- mation has occurred, eradication of the parasites is of little benefit.

1232,Mycotic Infections,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1644,"MYCOTIC INFECTIONS Fungi can be classified as yeasts, which are unicellular and reproduce by budding; as molds, which are multicellular and consist of tubular structures (hyphae) and grow by elongation and branching; or as dimorphic fungi, which can exist either as yeasts or molds depending on environmental conditions. Fun- gal infections can be categorized as shown in Table 41–7.  Table 41–7. Pediatric fungal infections.

Asymptomatically infects many normal hosts. eExcept Cryptococcus, which is often diagnosed by antigen detection. KOH, potassium hydroxide.   INFECTIONS: PARASITIC & MYCOTIC 1211 In the United States, systemic disease in normal hosts is commonly caused by three organisms—Coccidioides, Histo- plasma, and Blastomyces—which are restricted to certain geo- graphic areas. Prior residence in or travel to these areas, even for a brief time, is a prerequisite for inclusion in a differential diagnosis. Of these three, Histoplasma most often relapses years later in patients who are immunosuppressed. Immunosuppression, foreign bodies (eg, central cathe- ters), ulceration of gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosa, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, malnutrition, HIV infection, and neutrophil defects or depletion are major risk factors for opportunistic fungal disease. Laboratory diagnosis may be difficult because of the small number of fungi present in some lesions, slow growth of some organisms, and difficulty in distinguishing normal colonization of mucosal surfaces from infection. A tissue biopsy with fungal stains and culture is the best method for diagnosing systemic disease with some fungi. Repeat blood cultures may be negative even in the presence of intravascular infections. Serologic tests are useful for diagnosing coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmo- sis, and antigen detection is useful for diagnosing histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. The common superficial fungal infections of the hair and skin are discussed in Chapter 14. "
1233,Blastomycosis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1411,"BLASTOMYCOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Residence in or travel to an endemic area.  In immunocompetent patients, most often a self- limited flulike illness; acute pneumonia occurs in a minority of cases.  Complications include progressive pneumonia and dis- seminated disease (CNS, skin, bone and joints, geni- tourinary tract).  Diagnosis by culture of specimens from bronchoscopy, skin, or other tissue.  General Considerations The causative fungus, Blastomyces dermatitidis, is found in soil primarily in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, additional southeastern and south central states, and the states bordering the Great Lakes. Transmission is by inhala- tion of spores. Subclinical disease is common. Severe disease is much more common in adults and males. In children, infection rates are similar in both sexes.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Primary infection is unrecognized or produces pneumonia. Acute symptoms include cough, chest pain, headache, weight loss, and fever occurring several weeks to months after inoculation. Infection is usually self-limited in immu- nocompetent patients. In some patients an indolent progres- sive pulmonary disease occurs after an incubation period of 30–45 days. Cutaneous lesions usually represent dissemi- nated disease; local primary inoculation is rare. Slowly pro- gressive ulcerating lesions with a sharp, heaped-up border or verrucous lesions occur. Bone disease resembles other forms of chronic osteomyelitis. Lytic skull lesions in children are typical, but long bones, vertebrae, and the pelvis may be involved. Extrapulmonary disease occurs in 25–40% of patients with progressive disease. A total body radiographic examination is advisable when blastomycosis is diagnosed in the skin or another nonpulmonary site. The genitourinary tract involvement characteristic of dissemination in adults is rare in prepubertal children. Lymph nodes, brain, and kid- neys may be involved. B. Laboratory Findings Diagnosis requires isolation or visualization of the fungus. Pulmonary specimens (sputum, tracheal aspirates, or lung biopsy) may be positive with conventional stains or fungal cell wall stains. An initial suppurative response is followed by an increase in the number of mononuclear cells, and then formation of noncaseating granulomas. The budding yeasts are thick-walled, have refractile walls, and are very large and distinctive. Sputum specimens are positive in 50–80% of cases and skin lesions are positive in 80–100%. The fungus can be grown readily in most laboratories, but 1–2 weeks are required. Serologic tests are generally not helpful for diagno- sis. An ELISA antigen detection method, similar to that used for histoplasmosis, is useful for detecting Blastomyces antigen in urine and other body fluids. C. Imaging Radiographic consolidation and fibronodular interstitial and alveolar infiltrates are typical; effusions, hilar nodes, and cavities are less common. The paucity of cavitation distin- guishes acute blastomycosis from histoplasmosis and tuber- culosis. Miliary patterns also occur with acute infection. Chronic disease can develop in the upper lobes, with cavities and fibronodular infiltrations similar to those seen in tuber- culosis, but unlike in tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, these lesions rarely caseate or calcify.  Differential Diagnosis Primary pulmonary infection resembles acute viral, bacte- rial, or mycoplasmal infections. Blastomycosis should be considered when a significant pulmonary infection in an endemic area fails to respond to antibiotic therapy. Subacute infection mimics tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidi- oidomycosis. Chronic pulmonary or disseminated disease must be differentiated from cancer, tuberculosis, or other fungal infections.   CHAPTER 41 1212  Treatment Mild pulmonary blastomycosis does not require treatment; indeed, it is rarely recognized. Recommended therapy for life-threatening (especially in the immunocompromised pa- tient) or CNS infections is amphotericin B (0.7–1.0 mg/kg intravenously for a total of 1.5–2.0 g). Itraconazole (6–8 mg/ kg/d for 6 months) is preferred for other forms of blastomy- cosis. Bone disease may require a full year of itraconazole therapy. Surgical debridement is required for devitalized bone, drainage of large abscesses, and pulmonary lesions not responding to medical therapy.

1234,Candidiasis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,875,"CANDIDIASIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  In normal or immunosuppressed individuals: superfi- cial infections (oral thrush or ulcerations; vulvovagini- tis; erythematous intertriginous rash with satellite lesions); fungemia related to intravascular devices.  In immunosuppressed individuals: systemic infections (renal, hepatic, splenic, pulmonary, or cerebral abscesses); cotton-wool retinal lesions; cutaneous nodules.  In either patient population: budding yeast and pseudo- hyphae are seen in biopsy specimens, body fluids, or scrapings of lesions; positive culture.  General Considerations Disease due to Candida is caused by Candida albicans in 60– 80% of cases; similar systemic infection may be due to C tropicalis, C parapsilosis, C glabrata, and a few other Candida species. Speciation is important because of differences in pathogenicity and response to azole therapy. In tissue, pseu- dohyphae or budding yeast (or both) are seen. Candida grows on routine media more slowly than bacteria; growth is usually evident on agar after 2–3 days and in blood culture media in 2–7 days. C albicans is ubiquitous and often present in small num- bers on skin, mucous membranes, or in the intestinal tract. Normal bacterial flora, intact epithelial barriers, neutrophils and macrophages in conjunction with antibody and comple- ment, and normal lymphocyte function by skin test reactiv- ity are factors in preventing invasion. Disseminated infection is almost always preceded by prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, instrumentation (including intravascular catheters), or immunosuppression. Patients with diabetes mellitus are especially prone to superficial Candida infection; thrush and vaginitis are most common. Candida is the third most common blood isolate in hospitals in the United States and is a common cause of catheter-related urinary tract infection.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Oral candidiasis (thrush)—Adherent creamy white plaques on the buccal, gingival, or lingual mucosa are seen. These may be painful. Lesions may be few and asympto- matic, or they may be extensive, extending into the esopha- gus. Thrush is very common in otherwise normal infants in the first weeks of life; it may last weeks despite topical therapy. Spontaneous thrush in older children is unusual unless they have recently received antimicrobials. Cortico- steroid inhalation for asthma predisposes patients to thrush. HIV infection should be considered if there is no other reason for oral thrush, or if it is persistent or recurrent. Angular cheilitis is the name given to painful erythematous fissures caused by Candida at the corners of the mouth, often in association with a vitamin or iron deficiency. 2. Vaginal infection—Vulvovaginitis occurs in sexually active girls, in diabetic patients, and in girls receiving antibiotics. Thick, odorless, cheesy discharge with intense pruritus is typical. The vagina and labia are usually ery- thematous and swollen. Outbreaks are more frequent before menses. 3. Skin infection a. Diaper dermatitis—Diaper dermatitis is often due entirely or partly to Candida. Pronounced erythema with a sharply defined margin and satellite lesions is typical. Pus- tules, vesicles, papules, or scales may be seen. Weeping, eroded lesions with a scalloped border are common. Any moist area, such as axillae or neck folds, may be involved. b. Congenital skin lesions—These lesions may be seen in infants born to women with Candida amnionitis. A red maculopapular or pustular rash is seen. Dissemination may occur in premature infants, or in term infants after pro- longed rupture of membranes. c. Scattered red papules or nodules—Such findings may represent cutaneous dissemination. d. Paronychia and onychomycosis—These conditions occur in immunocompetent children but are often associat- ed with immunosuppression, hypoparathyroidism, or adre- nal insufficiency (Candida endocrinopathy syndrome). The selective absence of specific T-cell responses to Candida can lead to marked, chronic skin and nail infections called chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.   INFECTIONS: PARASITIC & MYCOTIC 1215  Prognosis Superficial disease in normal hosts has a good prognosis; in abnormal hosts, it may be refractory to therapy. Early ther- apy of systemic disease is often curative if the underlying immune response is adequate. The outcome is poor when therapy is delayed or when host response is inadequate.

1237,Coccidioidomycosis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1061,"COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Residence in or travel to an endemic area.  Primary pulmonary form: fever, chest pain, cough, anorexia, weight loss, and often a macular rash or erythema nodosum or multiforme.  Primary cutaneous form: skin trauma followed in 1–3 weeks by an ulcer and regional adenopathy.  Spherules seen in pus, sputum, CSF, joint fluid; positive culture.  Appearance of precipitating (early) and complement- fixing antibodies (late).  General Considerations Coccidioidomycosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Coccidioides immitis, which is endemic in the Sonoran Desert areas of western parts of Texas, southern New Mexico and Arizona, southern California, northern Mex- ico, and South America. Infection results from inhalation or inoculation of arthrospores (highly contagious and readily airborne in the dry climate). Even brief travel in or through an endemic area, especially during windy seasons, may allow infection. Human-to-human transmission does not occur. More than half of all infections are asympto- matic, and less than 5–10% are associated with significant pulmonary disease. Chronic pulmonary disease or dissem- ination occurs in less than 1% of cases.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Primary disease—The incubation period is 10–16 days (range, 7–28 days). Symptoms vary from those of a mild fever and arthralgia to severe influenza-like illness with high fever, nonproductive cough, pleurisy, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, night sweats, and anorexia. Upper respiratory tract signs are not common. Severe pleuritic chest pain suggests this diagnosis. Signs vary from none to rash, rales, pleural rubs, and signs of pulmonary consolidation. Weight loss may occur. 2. Skin disease—Up to 10% of children develop erythema nodosum or multiforme. These manifestations imply a favorable host response to the organism. Less specific macu- lopapular eruptions occur in a larger number of children. Skin lesions can occur following fungemia. Primary skin inoculation sites develop indurated ulcers with local adenop- athy. Contiguous involvement of skin from deep infection in nodes or bone also occurs. The presence of chronic skin lesions with this fungus should lead to a search for other areas of infection (eg, lung). 3. Chronic pulmonary disease—This is uncommon in chil- dren. Chronic disease is manifested by chronic cough (occa- sionally with hemoptysis), weight loss, pulmonary consoli- dation, effusion, cavitation, or pneumothorax. 4. Disseminated disease—This is less common in chil- dren than adults. It is more common in infants, neonates, pregnant women (especially during the third trimester), blacks, Filipinos, American Indians, and patients with HIV or other types of immunosuppression. One or more organs may be involved. The most common sites involved are bone or joint (usually a single bone or joint; subacute or chronic swelling, pain, redness), nodes, meninges (slowly progressive meningeal signs, ataxia, vomiting, headache, and cranial neuropathies), and kidney (dysuria and urinary frequency). As with most fungal diseases, the evolution of the illness is usually slow. B. Laboratory Findings Direct examination of respiratory secretions, pus, CSF, or tissue may reveal large spherules (30–60 μm) containing endospores. These are the product of coccidioidal spores germinating in tissue. Phase-contrast microscopy is useful for demonstrating these refractile bodies; Gram or methy- lene blue stains are not helpful, but periodic acid–Schiff reagent, methenamine silver, and calcofluor stains are. Fluffy, gray-white colonies grow within 2–5 days on routine fungal and many other media. CSF cultures are often negative. Routine laboratory tests are nonspecific. The sedimenta- tion rate is usually elevated.

1239,Cryptococcosis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,480,"CRYPTOCOCCOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Acute pneumonitis in immunocompetent individuals.  Immunosuppressed patients especially vulnerable to CNS infection (headache, vomiting, cranial nerve pal- sies, meningeal signs; mononuclear cell pleocytosis).  Cryptococcal antigen detected in CSF; also in serum and urine in some patients.  Readily isolated on routine media.  General Considerations Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous soil yeast. It appears to survive better in soil contaminated with bird excrement, especially that of pigeons. However, most infections in humans are not associated with a history of significant contact with birds. Inhalation is the presumed route of inoculation. Infections in children are rare, even in heavily immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV in- fection. Immunocompetent individuals can also be infected. Asymptomatic carriage does not occur.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Pulmonary disease—Pulmonary infection precedes dis- semination to other organs. It is frequently asymptomatic (ie, many older children and adults have serologic evidence of prior infection) and less often clinically apparent than cryptococcal meningitis. Pneumonia is the primary manifes- tation in one third of patients and CNS disease in 50%; cryptococcal pneumonia may coexist with cerebral involve- ment. Symptoms are nonspecific and subacute—cough, weight loss, and fatigue. 2. Meningitis—The most common clinical disease is men- ingitis, which follows hematogenous spread from a pulmo- nary focus. Symptoms of headache, vomiting, and fever occur over days to months. Meningeal signs and papilledema are common. Cranial nerve dysfunction and seizures may occur. 3. Other forms—Cutaneous forms are usually secondary to dissemination. Papules, pustules, and ulcerating nodules are typical. Bones (rarely joints) may be infected; osteolytic areas are seen, and the process may resemble osteosarcoma. Many other organs, especially the eye, can be involved with dissemination. B. Laboratory Findings The CSF usually has a lymphocytic pleocytosis; it may be completely normal in immunosuppressed patients who have cryptococcal meningitis. Direct microscopy may reveal organisms in sputum, CSF, or other specimens. The capsular antigen can be detected by latex agglutination or ELISA, which are both sensitive (> 90%) and specific. Serum, CSF, and urine may be tested. The serum may be negative if the only organ infected is the lung. False-negative CSF tests have been reported. The organism grows well after several days on many routine media; for optimal culture, collecting and concentrating a large amount of CSF (10 mL) is recom- mended, because the number of organisms may be low. C. Imaging Radiographic findings are usually lower lobe infiltrates or nodular densities; less often effusions; and rarely cavitation, hilar adenopathy, or calcification. Single or multiple focal mass lesions (cryptococcoma) may be detected in the CNS on CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan.  Differential Diagnosis Cryptococcal meningitis may mimic tuberculosis, viral men- ingoencephalitis, meningitis due to other fungi, or a space- occupying CNS lesion. Lung infection is difficult to differen- tiate from many causes of pneumonia.  Complications Hydrocephalus may be caused by chronic basilar meningitis. Symptomatic intracranial hypertension is common. Signifi- cant pulmonary or osseous disease may accompany the primary infection or dissemination.  Treatment Patients with symptomatic pulmonary disease should receive fluconazole for 3–6 months. All immunocompromised patients should have a lumbar puncture to rule out CNS infection; this should also be done for immunocompetent patients with cryptococcal antigen in the serum. Severely ill patients should receive amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg/d). Men- ingitis is treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine (100 mg/kg/d). This combination is synergistic and allows lower doses of amphotericin B to be used. Therapy is usually 6 weeks for CNS infections (or for 1 month after sterilization) and 8 weeks for osteomyelitis. An alternative is to substitute   CHAPTER 41 1218 fluconazole after 2 weeks of the combination therapy and continue fluconazole alone for 8–10 weeks. Fluconazole is the preferred maintenance therapy to prevent relapses in high-risk (HIV) patients. CSF antigen levels should be checked after 2 weeks of therapy. Intracranial hypertension is treated by frequent spinal taps or a lumbar drain.  Prognosis Treatment failure, including death, is common in immuno- suppressed patients, especially those with AIDS. Lifelong maintenance therapy may be required in these patients. Poor prognostic signs are the presence of extrameningeal disease; fewer than 20 cells/μL of initial CSF; and initial CSF antigen titer greater than 1:32. Chayakulkeeree M, Perfect JR: Cryptococcosis.

1240,Histoplasmosis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1191,"HISTOPLASMOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Residence in or travel to an endemic area.  Pneumonia with flulike illness.  Hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, leukopenia if dissem- inated.  Histoplasmal antigen in urine, blood, or CSF.  Detection of the organism in smears or tissue or by culture.  General Considerations The dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is found in the central and eastern United States (Ohio and Mississippi River valleys), Mexico, and most of South America. Soil contamination is enhanced by the presence of bat or bird feces. The small yeast form (2–4 μm) is seen in tissue, especially within macrophages. Infection is acquired by inhaling spores that transform into the pathogenic yeast phase. Infections in endemic areas are very common at all ages and are usually asymptomatic. Over two thirds of children are infected in these areas. Reactivation is very rare in children; it may occur years later, usually owing to significant immunosuppression. Reinfection also occurs. The extent of symptoms with primary or reinfection is influenced by the size of the infecting inoculum.  Clinical Findings Because human-to-human transmission does not occur, infection requires exposure in the endemic area—usually within prior weeks or months. Congenital infection does not occur. A. Symptoms and Signs 1. Asymptomatic infection (90% of infections)— Asymp- tomatic histoplasmosis is usually diagnosed by the presence of scattered calcifications in lungs or spleen and a positive skin test. The calcification may resemble that caused by tuberculosis but may be more extensive than the usual Ghon complex. 2. Pneumonia—Approximately 5% of patients have mild to moderate disease. Most of these patients are not recognized as having a histoplasmal infection. Acute pulmonary disease may resemble influenza, with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and cough occurring 1–3 weeks after exposure; the subacute form resembles infections such as tuberculosis, with cough, weight loss, night sweats, and pleurisy. Chronic disease is unusual in children. Physical examination may be normal, or rales may be heard. A small number of patients may have immune-mediated signs such as arthritis, pericarditis, and erythema nodosum. The usual duration of the disease is less than 2 weeks, followed by complete resolution. Symptoms may last several months and still resolve without antifungal therapy. 3. Disseminated infection (5% of infections)— Fungemia during primary infection probably occurs in the first 2 weeks of all infections, including those with minimal symptoms. Transient hepatosplenomegaly may occur, but resolution is the rule in immunocompetent individuals. Heavy exposure, severe underlying pulmonary disease, and immunosuppres- sion are risk factors for progressive reticuloendothelial cell infection, with anemia, fever, weight loss, organomegaly, bone marrow involvement, and death. Dissemination may occur in otherwise immunocompetent children; usually they are younger than age 2 years. 4. Other forms—Ocular involvement consists of multifocal choroiditis. This usually occurs in immunocompetent adults who exhibit other evidence of disseminated disease. Brain, pericardium, intestine, and skin (oral ulcers and nodules) are other involved sites. Adrenal gland involvement is common with systemic disease. B. Laboratory Findings Routine tests are normal or nonspecific in the benign forms. Pancytopenia is present in many patients with disseminated disease. The diagnosis can be made by demonstrating the   INFECTIONS: PARASITIC & MYCOTIC 1219 organism by histology or culture. Tissue yeast forms are small and may be mistaken for artifact. They are usually found in macrophages, occasionally in peripheral blood leukocytes in severe disease, but rarely in sputum, urine, or CSF. Cultures of infected fluids or tissues may yield the organism after 1–6 weeks of incubation on fungal media, but even cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage or transbronchial biopsy specimens in immunocompromised patients are often negative (15%). Thus bone marrow and tissue speci- mens are needed. Detection of histoplasmal antigen in blood, urine, CSF, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the most sensitive diagnostic test (90% positive in the urine with disseminated disease; 75% positive with acute pneumonia). The level of antigen correlates with the extent of the infec- tion, and antigen levels can be used to follow the response to therapy and to indicate low-grade infection persisting after completion of therapy (eg, in a child with HIV infection). Antibodies may be detected by immunodiffusion and complement fixation; the latter rises in the first 2–6 weeks of illness and fall unless dissemination occurs. Cross-reactions occur with some other endemic fungi. A single high titer or rising titer indicates a high likelihood of disease. Antigen detection has replaced serology as a rapid diagnostic test. C. Imaging Scattered pulmonary calcifications in a well child are typical of past infection. Bronchopneumonia (focal midlung infil- trates) occurs with acute disease, often with hilar and medi- astinal adenopathy, occasionally with nodules, but seldom with effusion. Apical cavitation occurs with chronic infec- tion, often on the background of preexisting pulmonary infection.  Differential Diagnosis Pulmonary disease resembles viral infection, tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis. Systemic disease resembles disseminated fungal or mycobacterial infection, leukemia, histiocytosis, or cancer.  Treatment Mild infections do not require therapy. Treatment is indicated for severe pulmonary disease (diffuse radiographic involve- ment); disseminated disease; when endovascular, CNS, or chronic pulmonary disease is present; and for children younger than age 1 year. Treatment should also be considered for patients who do not improve after 1 month. Disseminated disease in infants may respond to as few as 10 days of amphotericin B, although 4–6 weeks (or 30 mg/kg total dosage) is usually recommended. Amphotericin B is the pre- ferred therapy for moderately severe forms of the disease. Patients with severe disease may benefit from a short course of corticosteroid therapy (see also later section on Pneumocystis jiroveci). Surgical excision of chronic pulmonary lesions is rarely required. Itraconazole (3–5 mg/kg/d for 6–12 weeks; achieve peak serum level of >1.0 mcg/mL) appears to be equivalent to amphotericin B therapy for mild disease and can be substituted for amphotericin B in severe disease after a favorable initial response. With chronic pulmonary, CNS, or disseminated disease, prolonged therapy may be required. Quantitation of fungal antigen is useful for directing ther- apy. Histoplasmosis can reactivate in previously infected indi- viduals who subsequently become immunosuppressed. Chron- ically immunosuppressed patients (eg, those with HIV) may require lifelong maintenance therapy with an azole.  Prognosis Patients with mild and moderately severe infections have a good prognosis. With early diagnosis and treatment, infants with disseminated disease usually recover; the prognosis worsens if the immune response is poor. Silveira F, Paterson DL: Pulmonary fungal infections.

1241,Sporotrichosis,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,3962,"SPOROTRICHOSIS ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES  Subacute cutaneous ulcers.  New lesions appearing proximal to existing lesions along a draining lymphatic.  Absence of systemic symptoms.  Isolation of Sporothrix schenckii from wound drainage or biopsy.  General Considerations Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus present as a mold in soil, plants, and plant products from most areas of North and South America. Spores of the fungus can cause infection when they breach the skin at areas of minor trauma. Sporotrichosis has been transmitted from cutaneous lesions of pets.  Clinical Findings Cutaneous disease is by far the most common manifestation. Typically at the site of inapparent skin injury an initial papular lesion will slowly become nodular and ulcerate. Subsequent new lesions develop in a similar fashion proxi- mally along lymphatics draining the primary lesion. This sequence of developing painless, chronic ulcers in a linear pattern is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis. Solitary   CHAPTER 42 1226 care provider to obtain an accurate sexual history is crucial in prevention and control efforts. Questions must be explicit and understandable to the youth. If the adolescent has ever engaged in sexual activity, the provider needs to determine what kind of sexual activity (mutual masturbation or oral, anal, or vaginal sex); whether it has been heterosexual, homosexual, or both; whether birth control and condoms were used; and whether it has been consensual or forced. During the interview the clinician should take the opportu- nity to discuss risk-reduction techniques regardless of the history obtained from the youth. Importantly, female health care providers are twice as likely as male providers to screen female teenagers for STIs, so male health care providers need to better use screening opportunities. A routine laboratory screening process is warranted if the patient has engaged in intercourse, presents with STI symp- toms, or reports a partner with an STI. The availability of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), primarily for Chla- mydia and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has changed the nature of STI screening and intervention. These amplification tests are more than 95% sensitive and more than 99% specific, using either urine or cervical/urethral swabs. Annual screening of all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger is recommended for Chlamydia trachomatis. Routine chlamyd- ial testing should be considered for all adolescent males and, in particular, males who have sex with men, have new or multiple sex partners, or are in correctional facilities. Initial screening for urethritis in males begins with a physical examination. A first-catch urine sample (the first 10–40 mL of voided urine collected after not voiding for 2 hours) should be sent for Chlamydia and N gonorrhoeae testing if there are no signs (urethral discharge or lesions) or symptoms. With signs or symptoms, a urethral swab should be sent to test for both N gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia. A wet mount preparation should then be done on a spun urine sample or from urethral discharge, evaluating for the pres- ence of Trichomonas vaginalis. Screening asymptomatic females has become more com- plicated because a variety of approaches are available. Gener- ally, either a first-void urine specimen or a cervical swab is used to screen for Chlamydia and N gonorrhoeae by NAAT. When screening for N gonorrhoeae, it is important to recog- nize that certain NAATs are less sensitive when using urine compared with a cervical swab and may not be approved for urine screening. A wet preparation of the vaginal secretions should be performed annually to check for bacterial vagino- sis and trichomoniasis, and a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation done to screen for yeast infections. The Papani- colaou (Pap) smear serves to evaluate the cervix for the presence of HPV. The first Pap smear should be performed 3 years after the initiation of sexual intercourse, and then annually. HPV typing is no longer recommended. For both sexes if high-risk behavior is present (three or more partners in the last 6 months or more than two partners per year for several years), then screening for hepatitis B surface antigen is warranted if the individual was not fully immunized prior to initiation of sexual intercourse. The pres- ence of hepatitis B surface antigen indicates either the carrier state or active infection. Presence of only hepatitis B surface antibody identifies vaccinated individuals, whereas presence of hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis B surface antibody identifies individuals with past infection (see Chapter 21). In urban areas with a relatively high rate of syphilis or in males who have sex with men, an RPR/VDRL (rapid plasma reagin/Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test should be drawn yearly. RPR and HIV antibody tests should be done in all individuals in whom a concomitant STI is present. Fortenberry JD: "

SIGNS & SYMPTOMS For males, the most common symptoms are dysuria and penile discharge resulting from urethral inflammation. Less common symptoms are scrotal pain, hematuria, proctitis, and pruritus in the pubic region. Signs include epididymitis, orchi- tis, and urethral discharge. Rarely do males develop systemic symptoms. For females, the most common symptoms are vaginal discharge and dysuria. Vaginal itching and irregular menses or spotting are also common. Abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, although less common, are signs of PID. Pain in the genital region and dyspareunia may be present. Signs that can be found in both males and females with an STI include genital ulcerations, adenopathy, and genital warts. THE MOST COMMON  ANTIBIOTIC-RESPONSIVE  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae are STIs that are epidemic in the United States and are readily treated when appropriate antibiotics are administered in a timely fashion. CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS INFECTION  General Considerations C trachomatis is the most common bacterial cause of STIs in the United States. Three million cases are estimated to occur annually in adolescents and young adults. C trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that replicates within the cytoplasm of host cells. Destruction of Chlamydia-infected cells is mediated by host immune responses.    SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS 1233 males (55–67%) with N gonorrhoeae are asymptomatic. Both males and females can develop gonococcal proctitis and pharyngitis after appropriate exposure. B. Laboratory Findings A cervical swab from females should be sent for NAAT or cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. Obtaining specimens from the rectum or pharynx when clinically indicated will increase the likelihood of positive results. Pharyngeal infection requires more intensive therapy. Nongonococcal Neisseria species reside in the vagina, thereby negating the value of the Gram stain in a female. NAAT screening of female urine can be used; however, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is less sensitive (83%) compared with ligase chain reaction (99%). Culture or NAAT for N gonorrhoeae in males can be achieved with a swab of the urethra or first-void urine. Urethral culture is less sensitive (85%) compared with the 95–99% sensitivity using NAAT methods on either urethral or urine specimens. Gram stain of urethral discharge showing gram- negative intracellular diplococci indicates gonorrhea in a male. If proctitis is present, appropriate cultures should be obtained and treatment for both gonorrhea and Chlamydia infection given. If oral exposure to gonorrhea is suspected, cultures should be taken and the patient given empiric treatment.  Differential Diagnosis Gonococcal pharyngitis needs to be differentiated from streptococcal infection, herpes simplex pharyngitis, and infectious mononucleosis. Chlamydia infection needs to be differentiated from gonococcal infection.  Complications Disseminated gonococcal infection occurs in a minority (0.5–3%) of patients with untreated gonorrhea. Hematoge- nous spread most commonly causes arthritis and dermatitis. The joints most frequently involved are the wrist, metacar- pophalangeal joints, knee, and ankle. Skin lesions are typi- cally tender, with hemorrhagic or necrotic pustules or bullae on an erythematous base occurring on the distal extremities. Disseminated disease occurs more frequently in females than in males. Risk factors include pregnancy and gonococcal pharyngitis. Gonorrhea is complicated occasionally by peri- hepatitis and very rarely by endocarditis or meningitis.  Treatment Historically, patients diagnosed with gonorrhea were treated for chlamydia as well. As chlamydia testing has become more sensitive, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that treatment for coinfection is not necessary if testing for chlamydia has been done by NAAT. Their guide- lines also state that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis do not require tests of cure when they are treated with first-line medications, unless the patient remains symptomatic. If retesting is indicated it should be delayed for 1 month after completion of therapy if NAATs are used to document a test of cure. Retesting might also be considered for sexually active adolescents likely to be reinfected. Patients should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until both they and their partners have completed a course of treatment. Treatment for disseminated disease may require hospitalization (see Table 42–1). Quinolones should no longer be used to treat gonorrhea due to high levels of quinolone resistance in all populations in the United States. Failure of initial treatment should prompt reevaluation of the patient and consideration of retreatment with ceftriaxone.

1255,The Spectrum of Sexually Transmitted  Infections,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,3817,"THE SPECTRUM OF SEXUALLY  TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS The patient presenting with an STI usually has one or more of the signs or symptoms described in this section. Manage- ment considerations for STIs include assessing the patient’s adherence to therapy and ensuring follow-up, treating STIs in partners, and determining pregnancy risk. Treatment of each STI is detailed in Table 42–1. CERVICITIS  General Considerations Cervicitis is caused by C trachomatis or N gonorrhoeae approximately 30% of the time. HSV, T vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium are less common causes. Bacterial vaginosis has emerged as a new condition associated with cervicitis. Cervicitis can also be present without an STI.  Clinical Findings A. Symptoms and Signs Cervicitis is often asymptomatic, but many females have an abnormal vaginal discharge or postcoital bleeding. Purulent or mucopurulent endocervical exudate visible in the endocervical canal or on an endocervical swab specimen is characteristic of cervicitis. The cervix is often friable with easily induced bleeding. B.

1267,"Regulation of Body Fluids, Electrolytes,  & Tonicity",Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,83,"REGULATION OF BODY FLUIDS,  ELECTROLYTES, & TONICITY Total body water (TBW) constitutes 50–75% of the total body mass, depending on age, sex, and fat content. After an initial postnatal diuresis, the TBW slowly decreases to the adult range near puberty (Figure 43–1). TBW is divided into the intracel- lular and extracellular spaces. Intracellular fluid (ICF) ac- counts for two thirds of the TBW and extracellular fluid (ECF), for one third. The ECF is further compartmentalized into plasma (intravascular) volume and interstitial fluid (ISF). The principal constituents of plasma are sodium, chlo- ride, bicarbonate, and protein (primarily albumin). The ISF is similar to plasma but lacks significant amounts of protein (Figure 43–2). Conversely, the ICF is rich in potassium, magnesium, phosphates, sulfates, and protein. An understanding of osmotic shifts between the ECF and ICF is fundamental to understanding disorders of fluid balance. Iso-osmolality is generally maintained between fluid compartments. Because the cell membrane is water-perme- able, abnormal fluid shifts occur if the concentration of solutes that cannot permeate the cell membrane in the ECF does not equal the concentration of such solutes in the ICF. Thus NaCl, mannitol, and glucose (in the setting of hyper- glycemia) remain restricted to the ECF space and contribute effective osmoles by obligating water to remain in the ECF compartment. In contrast, a freely permeable solute such as urea does not contribute effective osmoles because it is not restricted to the ECF and readily crosses cell membranes. Tonicity, or effective osmolality, differs from measured osmolality in that it accounts only for osmotically active impermeable solutes rather than all osmotically active sol- utes, including those that are permeable to cell membranes. Osmolality may be estimated by the following formula: Although osmolality and osmolarity differ, the former being an expression of osmotic activity per weight (kg) and the latter per volume (L) of solution, for clinical purposes they are similar and occasionally used interchangeably. Oncotic pressure represents the osmotic activity of macromolecular constituents such as albumin in the plasma and body fluids. The principal mechanisms that regulate ECF volume and tonicity are antidiuretic hormone (ADH), thirst, aldoster- one, and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Antidiuretic Hormone In the kidney, ADH increases water reabsorption in the cortical and medullary collecting ducts, leading to formation of concentrated urine. In the absence of ADH, dilute urine is produced. Under normal conditions, ADH secretion is regu- lated by the tonicity of body fluids rather than the fluid volume and becomes detectable at a plasma osmolality of 280 mOsm/kg or greater. However, tonicity may be sacri- ficed to preserve ECF volume, as in the case of hyponatremic dehydration, wherein ADH secretion and renal water reten- tion are maximal. Thirst Water intake is commonly determined by cultural factors rather than by thirst. Thirst is not physiologically stimulated until plasma osmolality reaches 290 mOsm/kg, a level at which ADH levels are sufficient to induce maximal antidiuresis. Thirst provides control over a wide range of fluid volumes and can even be a response to an absence of or lack of responsive- ness to ADH, with attendant production of copious and dilute urine, as in diabetes insipidus. One who cannot perceive thirst develops profound problems with fluid balance.

At a constant osmolality, retention of Na+ leads to expansion of ECF volume and suppression of aldosterone release. Atrial Natriuretic Factor ANF, a polypeptide hormone secreted principally by the cardiac atria in response to atrial dilation, plays an important role in regulation of blood volume and blood pressure. ANF inhibits renin secretion and aldosterone synthesis and causes an increase in glomerular filtration rate and renal sodium excretion. ANF also guards against excessive plasma volume expansion in the face of increased ECF volume by shifting fluid from the vascular to the interstitial compartment. ANF inhibits angiotensin II- and norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction and acts in the brain to decrease the desire for salt and inhibit the release of ADH. Thus the net effect of ANF is a decrease in blood volume and blood pressure associated with natriuresis and diuresis. "
1268,Acid-Base Balance,Infections: Viral & Rickettsial ,1022,"ACID-BASE BALANCE The pH of arterial blood is maintained between 7.38 and 7.42 to ensure that pH-sensitive enzyme systems function nor- mally. Acid-base balance is maintained by interaction of the lungs, kidneys, and systemic buffering systems. Over 50% of the blood’s buffering capacity is provided by the carbonic acid–bicarbonate system, roughly 30% by hemoglobin, and the remainder by phosphates and ammonium. The carbonic acid–bicarbonate system, depicted chemically as: interacts with the lungs, kidneys, and nonbicarbonate sys- tems to stabilize systemic pH. The concentration of dissolved CO2 in blood is established by the respiratory system and that of HCO3 – by the kidneys. Disturbances in acid-base balance are initially stabilized by chemical buffering, com- pensated for by pulmonary or renal regulation of CO2 or HCO3 –, and ultimately corrected when the primary cause of the acid-base disturbance is eliminated. Renal regulation of acid-base balance is accomplished by the reabsorption of filtered HCO3 – and the excretion of H+ or HCO3 – to match the net input of acid or base. When urine is alkalinized, HCO3 – enters the kidney and is ultimately lost in the urine. Alkalinization of the urine may occur when an absolute or relative excess of bicarbonate exists. However, urinary alkaliniza- tion will not occur if there is a deficiency of Na+ or K+, because HCO3 – must also be retained to maintain electroneutrality. In contrast, the urine may be acidified if an absolute or relative decrease occurs in systemic HCO3 –. In this setting, proximal tubular HCO3 – reabsorption and distal tubular H+ excretion are maximal. A “paradoxical aciduria” with low urinary pH may also be seen in the setting of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and systemic K+ depletion when H+ is exchanged in preference to K+ in response to mineralocorticoid. Some of the processes involved in acid-base regulation are shown in Figure 43–3.

Over 50% of the blood’s buffering capacity is provided by the carbonic acid–bicarbonate system, roughly 30% by hemoglobin, and the remainder by phosphates and ammonium. The carbonic acid–bicarbonate system, depicted chemically as: interacts with the lungs, kidneys, and nonbicarbonate sys- tems to stabilize systemic pH. The concentration of dissolved CO2 in blood is established by the respiratory system and that of HCO3 – by the kidneys. Disturbances in acid-base balance are initially stabilized by chemical buffering, com- pensated for by pulmonary or renal regulation of CO2 or HCO3 –, and ultimately corrected when the primary cause of the acid-base disturbance is eliminated. Renal regulation of acid-base balance is accomplished by the reabsorption of filtered HCO3 – and the excretion of H+ or HCO3 – to match the net input of acid or base. When urine is alkalinized, HCO3 – enters the kidney and is ultimately lost in the urine. Alkalinization of the urine may occur when an absolute or relative excess of bicarbonate exists. However, urinary alkaliniza- tion will not occur if there is a deficiency of Na+ or K+, because HCO3 – must also be retained to maintain electroneutrality. In contrast, the urine may be acidified if an absolute or relative decrease occurs in systemic HCO3 –. In this setting, proximal tubular HCO3 – reabsorption and distal tubular H+ excretion are maximal. A “paradoxical aciduria” with low urinary pH may also be seen in the setting of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and systemic K+ depletion when H+ is exchanged in preference to K+ in response to mineralocorticoid. Some of the processes involved in acid-base regulation are shown in Figure 43–3. "

Therapy should be phased to (1) rapidly expand the ECF volume and restore tissue perfusion, (2) replenish fluid and electrolyte deficits while correcting attendant acid-base abnormalities, (3) meet the patient’s nutritional needs, and (4) replace ongoing losses. The cornerstone of therapy involves an understanding of maintenance fluid and electrolyte requirements. Maintenance requirements call for provision of enough water, glucose, and electrolytes to prevent deterioration of body stores. During short-term parenteral therapy, sufficient glucose is provided to prevent ketosis and limit protein catabolism, although this is usually little more than 20% of the patient’s true caloric needs. Prior to the administration of maintenance fluids, it is important to consider the patient’s volume status and to determine whether intravenous fluids are needed at all. Various models have been devised to facilitate calculation of maintenance requirements based on body surface area, weight, and caloric expenditure. A system based on caloric expenditure is most helpful, because 1 mL of water is needed for each kilocalorie expended. The system presented in Table 43–1 is based on caloric needs and is applicable to children weighing more than 3 kg. As depicted in Table 43–1, a child weighing 30 kg would need 1700 kcal and 1700 mL of water daily. If the child received parenteral fluids for 2 days, the fluid would usually contain 5% glucose, which would provide 340 kcal/d, or 20% of the maintenance caloric needs. Maintenance fluid require- ments take into account normal insensible water losses and water lost in sweat, urine, and stool, and assume the patient to be afebrile and relatively inactive. Thus if excessive losses occur standard “maintenance fluids” will be inadequate. In contrast, if losses are reduced for any reason standard “main- tenance fluid” administration would be excessive. Mainte- nance requirements are greater for low-birth-weight and pre- term infants. Table 43–2 lists other factors that commonly alter fluid and caloric needs. Electrolyte losses occur primarily through the urinary tract and to a lesser degree via the skin and stool. Although maintenance electrolyte estimates vary, reasonable approxi- mations for maintenance needs are 3 mEq Na+/100 kcal and 2 mEq K+/100 kcal or 30 mEq Na+/L and 20 mEq K+/L, respectively, of intravenous fluid. It is helpful to monitor the patient’s daily weight, urinary output, fluid input, and urine specific gravity. If fluid or electrolyte balance is abnormal, serial determination of elec- trolyte concentrations, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine may be necessary. In patients with significant burns, anuria, oliguria, or persistent abnormal losses (eg, from a stoma, or polyuria secondary to a renal concentrating defect), it is important to measure output, and if needed its components, so appropriate replacement can be provided.

Thus tissue perfusion is more significantly impaired for a given degree of hyponatremic dehydration than for a comparable degree of isotonic or hypertonic dehydration. It is important to note, however, that significant solute losses also occur in hypernatremic dehydration. Furthermore, because plasma volume is some- what protected in hypernatremic dehydration, it poses the risk of underestimating the severity of dehydration. Typical fluid and electrolyte losses associated with each form of dehydration are shown in Table 43–5. "
1272,Hyponatremia,Human Immunodeficiency  Virus Infection ,580,"HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia may be factitious in the presence of high plasma lipids or proteins, which decrease the percentage of plasma volume that is water. Hyponatremia in the absence of hypoto- nicity also occurs when an osmotically active solute, such as glucose or mannitol, is added to the ECF. Water drawn from the ICF dilutes the serum [Na+] despite isotonicity or hypertonicity. Patients with hyponatremic dehydration generally dem- onstrate typical signs and symptoms of dehydration (see Table 43–3), because the vascular space is compromised as water leaves the ECF to maintain osmotic neutrality. The treatment of hyponatremic dehydration is fairly straightfor- ward. The magnitude of the sodium deficit may be calculated by the following formula: Half of the deficit is replenished in the first 8 hours of therapy, and the remainder is given over the following 16 hours. Maintenance and replacement fluids should also be provided. The deficit plus maintenance calculations generally approximate 5% dextrose with 0.45% saline. The rise in serum [Na+] should not exceed 2 mEq/L/h. The dangers of too rapid correction of hyponatremia include cerebral dehydration and injury due to fluid shifts from the ICF compartment. Hypovolemic hyponatremia also occurs in cerebral salt wasting associated with central nervous system (CNS) insults, a condition characterized by high urine output and elevated urinary [Na+] (> 80 mEq/L) due to an increase in ANF. This must be distinguished from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH), which may also become manifest in CNS conditions and certain pulmonary disorders. In con- trast to cerebral salt wasting, SIADH is characterized by euvolemia or mild volume expansion and relatively low urine output due to ADH-induced water retention. Urinary [Na+] is high in both conditions, though generally not as high as in SIADH. It is important to distinguish between these two conditions, because the treatment of the former involves replacement of urinary salt and water losses, whereas the treatment of SIADH involves water restriction. In cases of severe hyponatremia (serum [Na+] < 120 mEq/L) with CNS symptoms, intravenous 3% NaCl may be given over 1 hour to raise the [Na+] to 120 mEq/L, to alleviate CNS manifestations and sequelae. In general, 6 mL/ kg of 3% NaCl will raise the serum [Na+] by 5 mEq/L. If 3% NaCl is administered, estimated Na+ and fluid deficits should be adjusted accordingly. Further correction should proceed slowly, as outlined earlier. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may occur in edematous disorders such as nephrotic syndrome, congestive heart fail- ure, and cirrhosis, wherein water is retained in excess of salt. Treatment involves restriction of Na+ and water and correc- tion of the underlying disorder. Hypervolemic hyponatremia due to water intoxication is characterized by a maximally dilute urine (specific gravity < 1.003) and is also treated with water restriction. HYPERNATREMIA Although diarrhea is commonly associated with hyponatremic or isonatremic dehydration, hypernatremia may develop in the presence of persistent fever or decreased fluid intake or in response to improperly mixed rehydration solutions. Ex- treme care is required to treat hypernatremic dehydration appropriately. If the serum [Na+] falls precipitously, the osmolality of the ECF drops more rapidly than that of the CNS. Water shifts from the ECF compartment into the CNS to maintain osmotic neutrality. If hypertonicity is corrected too rapidly (a drop in [Na+] of greater than 0.5–1 mEq/L/h), cerebral edema, seizures, and CNS injury may occur. Thus following the initial restoration of adequate tissue perfusion using isotonic fluids, a gradual decrease in serum [Na+] is desired (10–15 mEq/L/d). This is commonly achieved using 5% dextrose with 0.2% saline to replace the calculated fluid deficit over 48 hours. Maintenance and replacement fluids should also be provided. If the serum [Na+] is not correcting appropriately, the free water deficit may be estimated as 4 mL/kg of free water for each milliequivalent of serum [Na+] above 145 and provided as 5% dextrose over 48 hours. If metabolic acidosis is also present, it must be corrected slowly to avoid CNS irritability. Potassium is provided as indi- cated—as the acetate salt if necessary. Electrolyte concentra- Table 43–5.

Elevations of blood glucose and blood urea nitrogen may worsen the hyperosmolar state in hypernatremic dehydration and should also be monitored closely. Hyperglycemia is often associated with hyper- natremic dehydration and may necessitate lower intravenous glucose concentrations (eg, 2.5%). Patients with diabetes insipidus, whether nephrogenic or central in origin, are prone to develop profound hyper- natremic dehydration as a result of unremitting urinary free water losses (urine specific gravity < 1.010), particularly during superimposed gastrointestinal illnesses associated with vomiting or diarrhea. Treatment involves restoration of fluid and electrolyte deficits as described earlier as well as replacement of excessive water losses, with subsequent water deprivation testing during daylight hours to distinguish responsiveness to ADH. The evaluation and treatment of nephrogenic and central diabetes insipidus are discussed in detail in Chapters 22 and 32, respectively. Hypervolemic hypernatremia (salt poisoning), associated with excess total body salt and water, may occur as a conse- quence of providing improperly mixed formula, excessive NaCl or NaHCO3 administration, or as a feature of primary hyperal- dosteronism. Treatment includes the use of diuretics, and potentially, concomitant water replacement or even dialysis. "
1273,Potassium Disorders,Human Immunodeficiency  Virus Infection ,1491,"POTASSIUM DISORDERS The predominantly intracellular distribution of potassium is maintained by the actions of Na+-K+-ATPase in the cell membranes. Potassium is shifted into the ECF and plasma by acidemia and into the ICF in the setting of alkalosis, hypochloremia, or in conjunction with insulin-induced cel- lular glucose uptake. The ratio of intracellular to extracellu- lar K+ is the major determinant of the cellular resting membrane potential and contributes to the action potential in neural and muscular tissue. Abnormalities of K+ balance are potentially life-threatening. In the kidney, K+ is filtered at the glomerulus, reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, and excreted in the distal tubule. Distal tubular K+ excretion is regulated primarily by aldosterone. Renal K+ excretion con- tinues for significant periods even after the intake of K+ is decreased. Thus by the time urinary [K+] decreases, the systemic K+ pool has been depleted significantly. The causes of net K+ loss are primarily renal in origin. Gastrointestinal losses through nasogastric suction or vomit- ing reduce total body K+ to some degree. However, the attendant volume depletion results in an increase in plasma aldosterone, promoting renal excretion of K+ in exchange for Na+. Diuretics (especially thiazides), mineralocorticoids, and intrinsic renal tubular diseases (eg, Bartter syndrome) enhance the renal excretion of K+. Clinically, hypokalemia is associated with neuromuscular excitability, decreased peri- stalsis or ileus, hyporeflexia, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, and arrhythmias. Electrocardiographic changes include flattened T waves, a shortened PR interval, and the appearance of U waves. Arrhythmias associated with hypokalemia include premature ventricular contractions; atrial, nodal, or ventric- ular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation. Hypokalemia increases responsiveness to digitalis and may precipitate overt digitalis toxicity. In the presence of arrhythmias, extreme muscle weakness, or respiratory compromise, intra- venous K+ should be given. If the patient is hypophos- phatemic ([PO4 –3] < 2 mg/dL), a phosphate salt may be used. The first priority in the treatment of hypokalemia is the restoration of an adequate serum [K+]. Providing mainte- nance amounts of K+ is usually sufficient; however, when the serum [K+] is dangerously low and K+ must be administered intravenously, it is imperative that the patient have a cardiac monitor. Intravenous K+ should generally not be given faster than at a rate of 0.5 mEq/kg/h. Oral K+ supplements may be needed for weeks to replenish depleted body stores. Hyperkalemia—due to decreased renal K+ excretion, mineralocorticoid deficiency or unresponsiveness, or K+ release from the ICF compartment—is characterized by mus- cle weakness, paresthesias, and tetany; ascending paralysis; and arrhythmias. Electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, widening of the QRS complex, and arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest, atrioventricular block, nodal or idioventricular rhythms, and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The severity of hyperkalemia depends on the electrocardio- graphic changes, the status of the other electrolytes, and the stability of the underlying disorder. A rhythm strip should be obtained when significant hyperkalemia is suspected. If the serum [K+] is less than 6.5 mEq/L, discontinuing K+ supple- mentation is usually sufficient. If the serum [K+] is greater than 7 mEq/L or if potentiating factors such as hyponatre- mia, digitalis toxicity, and renal failure are present, more aggressive therapy is needed. If electrocardiographic changes or arrhythmias are present, treatment must be initiated promptly. Intravenous 10% calcium gluconate (0.2–0.5 mL/ kg over 2–10 minutes) will rapidly ameliorate depolarization and may be repeated after 5 minutes if electrocardiographic changes persist. Calcium should be given only with a cardiac monitor in place and should be discontinued if bradycardia develops. The intravenous administration of a diuretic that acts in the loop of Henle, such as furosemide (1–2 mg/kg), will augment renal K+ excretion and can be very helpful in lowering serum and total body [K+]. Administering Na+ and increasing systemic pH with bicarbonate therapy (1–2 mEq/ kg) will shift K+ from the ECF to the ICF compartment, as will therapy with a β-agonist such as albuterol. In nondiabetic patients, 0.5 g/kg of glucose over 1–2 hours will enhance endogenous insulin secretion, lowering serum [K+] 1–2 mEq/L. Administration of intravenous glucose and insulin may be needed as a simultaneous drip (0.5–1 g/kg glucose and 0.3 units of regular insulin per gram of glucose) given over 2 hours with monitoring of the serum glucose level every 15 minutes.   CHAPTER 43 1252 The therapies outlined above provide transient benefits. Ultimately, K+ must be reduced to normal levels by reestab- lishing adequate renal excretion using diuretics or optimiz- ing urinary flow, using ion exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or as a retention enema (0.2–0.5 g/kg orally or 1 g/kg as an enema), or by dialysis.

1274,Acid-Base Disturbances,Human Immunodeficiency  Virus Infection ,369,"ACID-BASE DISTURBANCES When evaluating a disturbance in acid-base balance, the sys- temic pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2), serum [HCO3 –], and anion gap must be considered. The anion gap, Na+ – (Cl– + HCO3 –), is an expression of the unmeasured anions in the plasma and is normally 12 ± 4 mEq/L. An increase above normal suggests the presence of an unmea- sured anion, such as occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, salicylate intoxication, and so on. Although the base excess (or deficit) is also used clinically, it is important to recall that this expression of acid-base balance is influenced by the renal response to respiratory disorders and cannot be inter- preted independently (as in a compensated respiratory acido- sis, wherein the base excess may be quite large). Recently, there has been greater interest in the Stewart approach to acid-base disturbances and the calculation of the “strong ion differ- ence,” which is beyond the scope of the present discussion. The interested reader is referred to the review by Gunnerson and Kellum listed in the references at the end of this chapter. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in serum [HCO3 –] and systemic pH due to the loss of HCO3 – from the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, the addition of an acid (from external sources or via altered metabolic pro- cesses), or the rapid dilution of the ECF with non-bicarbo- nate–containing solution (usually normal saline). When HCO3 – is lost through the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, Cl– must be reabsorbed with Na+ disproportionately, resulting in a hyperchloremic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Thus a normal anion gap acidosis in the absence of diarrhea or other bicarbonate-rich gastrointestinal losses suggests the possibility of renal tubular acidosis and should be evaluated appropri- ately. (See Chapter 22.) In contrast, acidosis that results from addition of an unmeasured acid is associated with a widened anion gap. Examples are diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, starvation, uremia, toxin ingestion (salicylates, ethylene glycol, or methanol), and certain inborn errors of organic or amino acid metabolism. Dehydration may also result in a widened anion gap acidosis as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion, decreased O2 delivery, and subsequent lactic and keto acid pro- duction. Respiratory compensation is accomplished through an increase in minute ventilation and a decrease in PCO2. The patient’s history, physical findings, and laboratory features should lead to the appropriate diagnosis. The ingestion of unknown toxins or the possibility of an inborn error of metabolism (see Chapter 34) must be consid- ered in children without an obvious cause for a widened anion gap acidosis. Unfortunately, some hospital laboratories fail to include ethylene glycol or methanol in their standard toxicol- ogy screens, so that these toxins must be requested specifically. This is of critical importance when therapy with fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole) must be considered for either ingestion— and instituted quickly to head off profound toxicity. Ethylene glycol (eg, antifreeze) is particularly worrisome because of its sweet taste and accounts for a significant number of toxin ingestions. Screening by fluorescence of urine under a Wood’s lamp is relatively simple but does not replace specific labora- tory assessment. Salicylate intoxication has a stimulatory effect on the respiratory center of the CNS; thus patients may initially present with respiratory alkalosis or mixed respiratory alkalosis and widened anion gap acidosis. Most types of metabolic acidosis will resolve with correc- tion of the underlying disorder, improved renal perfusion, and acid excretion. Intravenous NaHCO3 administration may be considered in the setting of metabolic acidosis when the pH is less than 7.0 or the [HCO3 –] is less than 5 mEq/L, but only if adequate ventilation is ensured. The dose (in milliequivalents) of NaHCO3 may be calculated as: and given as a continuous infusion over 1 hour. The effect of NaHCO3 in lowering serum potassium and ionized calcium concentrations must also be considered and monitored. METABOLIC ALKALOSIS Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a primary increase in [HCO3 –] and pH resulting from a loss of strong acid or gain of buffer base. The most common cause for a metabolic alkalosis is the loss of gastric juice via nasogastric suction or vomiting. This results in a Cl–-responsive alkalosis, characterized by a low urinary [Cl–] (< 20 mEq/L) indicative of a volume-contracted state that will be responsive to the provision of adequate Cl– salt (usually in the form of normal saline). Cystic fibrosis may also be associated with a Cl–-responsive alkalosis due to the high losses of NaCl through the sweat, whereas congenital Cl–-losing diarrhea is a rare cause of Cl–-responsive alkalo- sis. Chloride-resistant alkaloses are characterized by a uri- nary [Cl–] greater than 20 mEq/L and include Bartter syndrome, Cushing syndrome, and primary hyperaldoster- onism, conditions associated with primary increases in urinary [Cl–], or volume-expanded states lacking stimuli for Cl– reabsorption. Thus the urinary [Cl–] is helpful in distinguish- ing the nature of a metabolic alkalosis, but must be specifically requested in many laboratories because it is not routinely included in urine electrolyte screens. The serum [K+] is also low in these settings (hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis) owing to a combination of increased mineralocorticoid activity associated with volume contraction, the shift of K+ to the ICF compart-  Weight kg ( ) Base deficit × 0.3 ×   CHAPTER 43 1252 The therapies outlined above provide transient benefits.

The most common cause for a metabolic alkalosis is the loss of gastric juice via nasogastric suction or vomiting. This results in a Cl–-responsive alkalosis, characterized by a low urinary [Cl–] (< 20 mEq/L) indicative of a volume-contracted state that will be responsive to the provision of adequate Cl– salt (usually in the form of normal saline). Cystic fibrosis may also be associated with a Cl–-responsive alkalosis due to the high losses of NaCl through the sweat, whereas congenital Cl–-losing diarrhea is a rare cause of Cl–-responsive alkalo- sis. Chloride-resistant alkaloses are characterized by a uri- nary [Cl–] greater than 20 mEq/L and include Bartter syndrome, Cushing syndrome, and primary hyperaldoster- onism, conditions associated with primary increases in urinary [Cl–], or volume-expanded states lacking stimuli for Cl– reabsorption. Thus the urinary [Cl–] is helpful in distinguish- ing the nature of a metabolic alkalosis, but must be specifically requested in many laboratories because it is not routinely included in urine electrolyte screens. The serum [K+] is also low in these settings (hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis) owing to a combination of increased mineralocorticoid activity associated with volume contraction, the shift of K+ to the ICF compart-  Weight kg ( ) Base deficit × 0.3 ×   CHAPTER 43 1252 The therapies outlined above provide transient benefits. Ultimately, K+ must be reduced to normal levels by reestab- lishing adequate renal excretion using diuretics or optimiz- ing urinary flow, using ion exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or as a retention enema (0.2–0.5 g/kg orally or 1 g/kg as an enema), or by dialysis. ACID-BASE DISTURBANCES When evaluating a disturbance in acid-base balance, the sys- temic pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2), serum [HCO3 –], and anion gap must be considered. The anion gap, Na+ – (Cl– + HCO3 –), is an expression of the unmeasured anions in the plasma and is normally 12 ± 4 mEq/L. An increase above normal suggests the presence of an unmea- sured anion, such as occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, salicylate intoxication, and so on. Although the base excess (or deficit) is also used clinically, it is important to recall that this expression of acid-base balance is influenced by the renal response to respiratory disorders and cannot be inter- preted independently (as in a compensated respiratory acido- sis, wherein the base excess may be quite large). Recently, there has been greater interest in the Stewart approach to acid-base disturbances and the calculation of the “strong ion differ- ence,” which is beyond the scope of the present discussion. The interested reader is referred to the review by Gunnerson and Kellum listed in the references at the end of this chapter. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in serum [HCO3 –] and systemic pH due to the loss of HCO3 – from the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, the addition of an acid (from external sources or via altered metabolic pro- cesses), or the rapid dilution of the ECF with non-bicarbo- nate–containing solution (usually normal saline). When HCO3 – is lost through the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, Cl– must be reabsorbed with Na+ disproportionately, resulting in a hyperchloremic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Thus a normal anion gap acidosis in the absence of diarrhea or other bicarbonate-rich gastrointestinal losses suggests the possibility of renal tubular acidosis and should be evaluated appropri- ately. (See Chapter 22.) In contrast, acidosis that results from addition of an unmeasured acid is associated with a widened anion gap. Examples are diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, starvation, uremia, toxin ingestion (salicylates, ethylene glycol, or methanol), and certain inborn errors of organic or amino acid metabolism. Dehydration may also result in a widened anion gap acidosis as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion, decreased O2 delivery, and subsequent lactic and keto acid pro- duction. Respiratory compensation is accomplished through an increase in minute ventilation and a decrease in PCO2. The patient’s history, physical findings, and laboratory features should lead to the appropriate diagnosis. The ingestion of unknown toxins or the possibility of an inborn error of metabolism (see Chapter 34) must be consid- ered in children without an obvious cause for a widened anion gap acidosis. Unfortunately, some hospital laboratories fail to include ethylene glycol or methanol in their standard toxicol- ogy screens, so that these toxins must be requested specifically. This is of critical importance when therapy with fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole) must be considered for either ingestion— and instituted quickly to head off profound toxicity. Ethylene glycol (eg, antifreeze) is particularly worrisome because of its sweet taste and accounts for a significant number of toxin ingestions. Screening by fluorescence of urine under a Wood’s lamp is relatively simple but does not replace specific labora- tory assessment. Salicylate intoxication has a stimulatory effect on the respiratory center of the CNS; thus patients may initially present with respiratory alkalosis or mixed respiratory alkalosis and widened anion gap acidosis. Most types of metabolic acidosis will resolve with correc- tion of the underlying disorder, improved renal perfusion, and acid excretion. Intravenous NaHCO3 administration may be considered in the setting of metabolic acidosis when the pH is less than 7.0 or the [HCO3 –] is less than 5 mEq/L, but only if adequate ventilation is ensured. The dose (in milliequivalents) of NaHCO3 may be calculated as: and given as a continuous infusion over 1 hour. The effect of NaHCO3 in lowering serum potassium and ionized calcium concentrations must also be considered and monitored. "

1275,Respiratory Acidosis,Human Immunodeficiency  Virus Infection ,184,"RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS Respiratory acidosis develops when alveolar ventilation is decreased, increasing PCO2 and lowering systemic pH. The kidneys compensate for respiratory acidosis by increasing HCO3 – reabsorption, a process that takes several days to manifest. Patients with acute respiratory acidoses frequently demonstrate air hunger with retractions and the use of accessory respiratory muscles. Respiratory acidoses occur in upper or lower airway obstruction, ventilation-perfusion disturbances, CNS depression, and neuromuscular defects. Hypercapnia is not as detrimental as the hypoxia that usually accompanies these disorders. The goal of therapy is to correct or compensate for the underlying pathologic process, to improve alveolar ventilation. Bicarbonate therapy is not indicated in a pure respiratory acidosis, because it will worsen the acidosis by shifting the equilibrium of the car- bonic acid–bicarbonate buffer system to increase PCO2. RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS Respiratory alkalosis occurs when hyperventilation results in a decrease in PCO2 and an increase in pH. Patients may experience tingling, paresthesias, dizziness, palpitations, syn- cope, or even tetany and seizures due to the associated decrease in ionized calcium. Causes of respiratory alkalosis include psychobehavioral disturbances, CNS irritation from meningitis or encephalitis, and salicylate intoxication. Ther- apy is directed toward the causal process. Rebreathing into a paper bag will decrease the severity of symptoms in acute hyperventilation. REFERENCES Adrogue JA, Madias NE: Management of life-threatening acid– base disorders: Parts 1 and 2.

Accurso, MD Laboratory tests provide valuable information necessary to evaluate a patient’s condition and to monitor recom- mended treatment. Chemistry and hematology test results are compared with those of healthy individuals or those undergoing similar therapeutic treatment to determine clinical status and progress. In the past, the term normal ranges relayed some ambiguity because statistically, the term normal also implied a specific (gaussian or normal) distribution and epidemiologically it implied the state of the majority, which is not necessarily the desirable or targeted population. This is most apparent in cholesterol levels, where values greater than 200 mg/dL are common, but not desirable. Use of the term reference range or reference interval is therefore recommended by the Interna- tional Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, for- merly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, NCCLS) to indicate that the values relate to a reference population and clinical condition. Reference ranges are established for a specific age (eg, α- fetoprotein), sex, and sexual maturity (eg, luteinizing hor- mone and testosterone); they are also defined for a specific pharmacologic status (eg, taking cyclosporine), dietary restrictions (eg, phenylalanine) and stimulation protocol (eg, growth hormone). Similarly, diurnal variation is a factor (eg, cortisol), as is degree of obesity (eg, insulin). Some reference ranges are particularly meaningful when combined with other results (eg, parathyroid hormone and calcium), or when an entire set of analytes is evaluated (eg, lipid profile: triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein). Laboratory tests are becoming more specific and measure much lower concentrations than ever before. Therefore reference ranges should reflect the analytical procedure, as well as reagents and instrumentation used for a specific analysis. As test methodology continues to evolve, reference ranges are modified and updated. "
1276,Challenges in Determining & Interpreting  Pediatric Reference Intervals,Infections: Bacterial & Spirochetal ,2173,"CHALLENGES IN DETERMINING  & INTERPRETING PEDIATRIC REFERENCE INTERVALS The pediatric environment is particularly challenging for the determination of reference intervals since growth and devel- opmental stages do not have a distinct and finite boundary by which test results can be tabulated. Reference ranges may overlap and, in many cases, complicate diagnosis and treat- ment. Collection and allocation of test results by age for the purpose of establishing a reference range is a convenient and manageable way to report them, but caution is needed in their interpretation and clinical correlation. A particular difficulty lies in establishing reference ranges for analytes whose levels are changed under scheduled stim- ulation conditions. The common glucose tolerance test is such an example, but more complex endocrinology tests (eg, stimulation by clonidine and cosyntropin) require skill and extensive experience to interpret. Reference ranges for these serial tests are established over a long period of time and are not easily transferable between test methodologies. Chang- ing analytical technologies adds a new dimension to the challenges of establishing pediatric reference ranges. GUIDELINES FOR USE OF DATA  IN A REFERENCE RANGE STUDY The College of American Pathologists provides guidelines for the adoption of reference ranges used in hospitals and commercial clinical laboratories. It recognizes the enormous task of establishing a laboratory’s own reference ranges, and recommends alternatives to the process. A laboratory may acquire reference ranges by: 1. Conducting its own study to evaluate a statistically significant number of “healthy” volunteers.

A histogram depicting the nongaussian distribution of data from a free thyroxine reference range study conducted at Children’s Hospital in Denver is shown in Figure 44–2. WHY REFERENCE INTERVALS VARY Recent modifications to reference ranges are due to the introduction of new and improved analytical procedures, advanced automated instrumentation, and standardization of reagents and reference materials. Reference ranges are also affected by preanalytical variations that can occur during sample collection, processing, and storage. Preanalytical variations of biological origin can occur when specimens are drawn in the morning versus in the evening, or from hospitalized recumbent patients versus ambulatory outpatients. Variations may also be caused by metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Preanalytical factors may be a product of the socioeconomic environment or ethnic background (eg, genetic or dietary). Analytical variations are caused by differences in analyt- ical measurements and depend on the analytical tools as well as an inherent variability in obtaining a quantitative value. Furthermore, scientific progress is constantly introducing new reagents, instruments, and improved testing procedures to the clinical laboratory, and each tool adds an element of variability between tests. 1. Antigen-antibody reactions have revolutionized clinical chemistry, but have also added a degree of variability because biologically derived reagents have different specificity and sensitivity. In addition to the targeted analyte, some of its metabolites are also measured, and these may or may not be biologically active. 2. Reference materials continue to be reviewed and evalu- ated by organizations such as the World Health Organi- zation and the National Institute for Standards and Technology. A new standard was recently established for troponin I, and reference ranges were modified to reflect the new standard. 3. Analytical instrumentation with advanced electronics and robotics has improved accuracy of results and increased throughput. However, they have added an element of variability between instruments from differ- ent manufacturers. 4. Analytical detection methods have also made big strides as they have expanded from simple ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry, to fluorescence, nephelometry, radio- immunoassay, and chemiluminescence. For example, the third-generation thyroid-stimulating hormone assays can now measure concentrations as low as 0.001 μIU/mL, and the reference range was recently modified to reflect the improved sensitivity of the assay.

1278,Sensitivity & Specificity,Infections: Bacterial & Spirochetal ,2658,"SENSITIVITY & SPECIFICITY Despite its statistical derivation, a reference interval does not necessarily provide a finite and clear-cut guideline as to whether a patient has a disease. There will always be a segment of the population with test values that fall within the reference interval, but clinical manifestations that indi- cate disease is present. Similarly, a segment of the popula- tion will have test values outside the reference interval, but no clinical signs of disease. The ability of a test and corresponding reference interval to detect individuals with disease is defined by the diagnostic sensitivity of the test. Similarly, the ability of a test to detect individuals without disease is described by the diagnostic specificity. These characteristics are governed by the analytical quality of the test, as well as the numerical parameters (reference inter- val) that define the presence of disease. The tolerance level for the desired sensitivity and specificity of a test requires significant input from clinicians. Generally, specificity increases as sensitivity decreases. A typical reference range frequency distribution, shown in Figure 44–3 (solid line), provides information on the test results of a number of healthy subjects, or individuals without the disease. A second curve (dashed line) shows test results for individuals with the disease. As with most tests, there is an overlap area. A patient with a test result of 1 is likely healthy, and the result indicates a true negative (TN) for the presence of disease. A patient with a test result of 9 is likely to have the disease and the test result is a true positive (TP).There is a small, but significant population with a test result of 2–5 in whom the test is not 100% conclusive. A statistical analysis may determine the most likely cutoff for healthy individuals, but the clinically acceptable cutoff depends on the test as well as clinical correlation. Where the treatment is aggressive and has serious side effects, a clinician may choose to err on the side of caution and hold treatment for anyone with a test value of less than 6. ▲ Figure 44–2.
