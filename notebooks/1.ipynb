       "      <td>THE NEONATAL HISTORY The newborn medical history has three key components: (1) maternal and paternal medical and genetic history, (2) maternal past obstetric history, and (3) current antepar- tum and intrapartum obstetric history. The mother’s medical history includes chronic medical conditions, medications taken during pregnancy, unusual dietary habits, smoking history, occupational exposure to chemicals or infections of potential risk to the fetus, and any social history that might increase the risk for parenting prob- lems and child abuse. Family illnesses with genetic implica- tions should be sought. The past obstetric history includes maternal age, gravidity, parity, blood type, and pregnancy outcomes. The current obstetric history includes the results of procedures during the current pregnancy such as ultrasound, amniocentesis, screening tests (rubella antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, serum quadruple screen for genetic disorders, HIV), and antepartum tests of fetal well-being (eg, biophysical profiles, nonstress tests, or Doppler assessment of fetal blood flow patterns). Pregnancy-related maternal complications such as urinary tract infection, pregnancy-induced hyperten- sion, eclampsia, gestational diabetes, vaginal bleeding, and preterm labor should be documented. Significant peripartum events include duration of ruptured membranes, maternal fever, fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), anesthesia and analgesia used, reason for operative or forceps delivery, infant status at birth, resuscitative measures, and Apgar scores. ASSESSMENT OF GROWTH  &amp; GESTATIONAL AGE It is important to know the infant’s gestational age because normal behavior and possible medical problems can be predicted on this basis. The date of the last menstrual period is the best indicator of gestational age. Uterine fundal height and early fetal ultrasound provide supporting information. Postnatal physical characteristics and neurologic develop- ment are also clues to gestational age. Table 1–1 lists the physical and neurologic criteria of maturity used to estimate gestational age by the Ballard score method. Adding the scores assigned to each neonatal physical and neuromuscular sign yields a score corresponding to gestational age. Disappearance of the anterior vascular capsule of the lens is also helpful in determining gestational age. Until 27–28 weeks’ gestation, the lens capsule is covered by vessels; by 34 weeks, this vascular plexus is completely atrophied. Foot length, from the heel to the tip of the longest toe, also correlates with gestational age in appropriately grown infants. The foot measures 4.5 cm at 25 weeks’ gestation and increases 0.25 cm per week until term. If the physical examination indicates a gestational age within 2 weeks of that predicted by the obstetric dates, the gestational age is as assigned by the obstetric date. Birth weight and gestational age are plotted on standard grids (Figure 1–1) to determine whether the birth weight is appropriate for gestational age (AGA), small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA). Another term for SGA is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Birth weight for gestational age in normal neonates varies with \u0002 Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Assess the character of the cry; a high-pitched cry may indicate disease of the central nervous system (CNS) such as hemorrhage. Hypotonia and a weak cry may indicate systemic disease or congenital neuromuscular disorder. Check the following newborn reflexes: 1. Sucking reflex in response to a nipple or the examiner’s finger in the mouth. This reflex is observed by 14 weeks’ gestation. 2. Rooting reflex: Head turns to the side of a facial stimu- lus. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation. 3. Traction response: The infant is pulled by the arms to a sitting position. Initially, the head lags, then with active flexion, comes to the midline briefly before falling forward. 4. Palmar grasp with placement of the examiner’s finger in the palm. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation and disappears by age 4 months. 5. Deep tendon reflexes: Several beats of ankle clonus and an upgoing Babinski reflex may be normal. 6. Moro (startle) reflex: Hold the infant supine while sup- porting the head. Allow the head to drop 1–2 cm suddenly. The arms will abduct at the shoulder and extend at the elbow with spreading of the fingers. Adduction with flexion will follow. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation (incomplete) and disappears by age 3 months. 7. Tonic neck reflex: Forcibly turn the infant’s head to one side; the arm and leg on that side will extend while the opposite arm and leg flex (“fencing position”). This reflex disappears by age 8 months. Adam M, Hudgins L: The importance of minor anomalies in the evaluation of the newborn. NeoReviews 2003;4:e99.

       "      <td>CARE OF THE WELL NEONATE The primary responsibility of the Level 1 nursery is care of the well neonate—promoting mother-infant bonding, establishing feeding, and teaching the basics of newborn care. Staff must monitor infants for signs and symptoms of illness, including temperature instability, change in activ- ity, refusal to feed, pallor, cyanosis, early or excessive jaundice, tachypnea, respiratory distress, delayed (beyond 24 hours) first stool or first void, and bilious vomiting. Several preventive measures are routine in the normal newborn nursery. Prophylactic erythromycin ointment is applied to the eyes within 1 hour of birth to prevent gonococcal oph- thalmia. Vitamin K (1 mg) is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously within 4 hours of birth to prevent hemor- rhagic disease of the newborn. All infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine. Both hepa- titis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) are administered if the mother is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). If maternal HBsAg status is unknown, vaccine should be given, maternal blood should be tested for HBsAg, and HBIG should be given to the neonate before 7 days of age if the test is positive. Cord blood is collected from all infants at birth and used for blood typing and Coombs testing if the mother is type O or Rh-negative. Rapid glucose testing should be performed in infants at risk for hypoglycemia (infants of diabetic mothers, preterm, SGA, LGA, or stressed infants). Values below 45 mg/dL should be confirmed by laboratory blood glucose testing and treated. Hematocrit should be measured at age 3–6 hours in infants at risk for or those who have symptoms of polycythe- mia or anemia. State-sponsored newborn genetic screens (for inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria [PKU], galac- tosemia, sickle cell disease, hypothyroidism, and cystic fibro- sis) are performed prior to discharge, after 24–48 hours of age if possible. In many states, a repeat test is required at 8– 14 days of age because the PKU test may be falsely negative when obtained before 48 hours of age. Not all state-man- dated screens include the same panel of diseases. The most recent addition in some states is a screen for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In infants with prolonged postpartum hospitalization, genetic screening should be performed by 1 week of age. In addition to the state-mandated screen, some centers offer expanded newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry to look for other inborn errors such as fatty acid oxidation defects. Infants should routinely be positioned supine to mini- mize the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Prone positioning is contraindicated unless there are com- pelling clinical reasons for that position. Bed sharing with adults and prone positioning are associated with increased risk of SIDS. FEEDING THE WELL NEONATE A neonate is ready for feeding if he or she is (1) alert and vigorous, (2) has no abdominal distention, (3) has good bowel sounds, and (4) has a normal hunger cry. These signs usually occur within 6 hours after birth, but fetal distress or traumatic delivery may prolong this period. The healthy full- term infant should be allowed to feed every 2–5 hours on demand. The first breast feeding may occur in the delivery room. For formula-fed infants, the first feeding usually occurs by 3 hours of life. The feeding volume generally increases from 0.5–1 oz per feeding initially to 1.5–2 oz per feeding on day 3. By day 3, the average full-term newborn takes about 100 mL/kg/d of milk. A wide range of infant formulas satisfy the nutritional needs of most neonates. Breast milk is the standard on which \u0002  \u0002 CHAPTER 1 10 evoked otoacoustic emissions as early as possible because up to 40% of hearing loss will be missed by risk analysis alone. Primary care providers and parents should be advised of the possibility of hearing loss and offered immediate referral in suspect cases. With the use of universal screening, the aver- age age at which hearing loss is confirmed has dropped from 24–30 months to 2–3 months. If remediation is begun by 6 months, language and social development are commensu- rate with physical development.

       "      <td>COMMON PROBLEMS  IN THE TERM NEWBORN NEONATAL JAUNDICE \u0003 General Considerations Sixty-five percent of newborns develop visible jaundice with a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level higher than 6 mg/dL during the first week of life. The normal newborn is deficient in antioxidants such as vitamin E, catalase, and superoxide dis- mutase. Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and peroxyl scaven- ger and may protect the newborn from oxygen toxicity in the first days of life. Approximately 8–10% of newborns develop excessive hyperbilirubinemia (TSB &gt; 17 mg/dL), and 1–2% have TSB above 20 mg/dL. Extremely high and potentially dangerous TSB levels are rare. Approximately 1 in 700 infants have TSB higher than 25 mg/dL, and 1 in 10,000 have TSB above 30 mg/dL. Such high levels can cause kernicterus, characterized by injury to the basal ganglia and brainstem. Kernicterus caused by hyperbilirubinemia was common in neonates with Rh-isoimmunization until the institution of exchange transfusion for affected infants and postpar- tum high-titer Rho (D) immune globulin treatment for sensitized mothers. For several decades after the introduc- tion of exchange transfusion and phototherapy aimed at keeping the neonate’s TSB below 20 mg/dL, there were no reported cases of kernicterus in the United States. Since the early 1990s, however, there has been a reappearance of kernicterus, with more than 120 cases reported to a volun- tary registry. Common factors in the recent cases are newborn discharge before 48 hours (all but one), breast feeding (100%), delayed measurement of TSB, unrecog- nized hemolysis, lack of early postdischarge follow-up, and failure to recognize the early symptoms of encephalopathy. Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of heme (iron protoporphyrin) in the reticuloendothelial system and bone marrow. Heme is cleaved by heme oxygenase to iron, which is conserved; carbon monoxide, which is exhaled; and biliverdin, which is converted to bilirubin by bilirubin reductase. Each gram of hemoglobin yields 34 mg of biliru- bin (1 mg/dL = 17.2 mmol/L of bilirubin). This unconju- gated bilirubin is bound to albumin and carried to the liver, where it is taken up by hepatocytes. In the presence of the uridyldiphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT; glucuro- nyl transferase), bilirubin is conjugated to one or two glucu- Table 1–5. Contraindications  to early newborn discharge.

Twinning historically occurred at a rate of 1 in 80 pregnan- cies (1.25%). The incidence of twinning and higher-order multiple births in the United States has increased because of in-vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive tech- nologies. In 2002, twins occurred in 1 in 32 live births in the United States, with multiple births accounting for 3.3% of all births. A distinction should be made between dizygous (frater- nal) and monozygous (identical) twins. Race, maternal par- ity, and maternal age affect the incidence of dizygous, but not monozygous, twinning. Drugs used to induce ovulation, such as clomiphene citrate and gonadotropins, increase the incidence of dizygotic or polyzygotic twinning. Monozygous twinning also seems to be more common after assisted reproduction. The incidence of malformations is also increased in identical twins and may affect only one of the twins. If a defect is found in one twin, the other should be examined carefully for lesser degrees of the same defect. Early transvaginal ultrasound and examination of the placenta after birth can help establish the type of twinning: Two amnionic membranes and two chorionic membranes are found in all dizygous twins and in one third of monozy- gous twins even when the placental disks appear to be fused into one. A single chorionic membrane always indicates monozygous twins. The rare monochorial, monoamniotic situation (1% of twins) is especially dangerous, with a high risk of antenatal cord entanglement and death of one or both twins. Close fetal surveillance is indicated. \u0003 Complications of Multiple Births A. Intrauterine Growth Restriction There is some degree of IUGR in most multiple pregnancies, especially after 32 weeks, although it is usually not clinically significant with two exceptions. First, in monochorial twin pregnancy an arteriovenous shunt may develop between the twins (twin-twin transfusion syndrome). The twin on the venous side (recipient) becomes plethoric and larger than the smaller anemic twin (donor), who may ultimately die or be severely growth restricted. The occurrence of polyhy- dramnios in the larger twin and oligohydramnios in the smaller may be the first sign of this problem. Second, discordance in size (birth weights that are significantly dif- ferent) can also occur when separate placentas are present if one placenta develops poorly, because of a poor implanta- tion site. In this instance, no fetal exchange of blood takes place but the growth rates of the two infants are different. B. Preterm Delivery Length of gestation tends to be inversely related to the number of fetuses. The mean age at delivery for singletons is 38.8 weeks, for twins 35.3 weeks, for triplets 32.2 weeks, and for quadruplets 29.9 weeks. The prematurity rate in multiple gestations is 5–10 times that of singletons, with 50% of twins and 90% of triplets born before 37 weeks. There is an increased incidence of cerebral palsy in multiple births, more so with monochorial than dichorial infants. Prematurity is the main cause of increased mortality and morbidity in twins, although in the case of monochorial twins, intravascular exchange through placental anastomoses, particularly after the death of one twin, also increases the risk substantially. C. Obstetric Complications Polyhydramnios, pregnancy-induced hypertension, prema- ture rupture of membranes, abnormal fetal presentations, and prolapsed umbilical cord occur more frequently in women with multiple fetuses. Multiple pregnancy should always be identified prenatally with ultrasound examina- tions; doing so allows the obstetrician and pediatrician or neonatologist to plan management jointly. Because neonatal complications are usually related to prematurity, prolonga- tion of pregnancy significantly reduces neonatal morbidity.

Intrapartum support includes maintaining maternal blood pressure, maternal oxygen therapy, positioning the mother to improve placental perfusion, readjusting oxytocin infusions or administering a tocolytic if appropriate, minimizing trauma to the infant, obtaining all necessary cord blood samples, and completing an examination of the placenta. The pediatrician or neonatologist focuses on temperature support, initiation and maintenance of effective ventilation, maintenance of per- fusion and hydration, and glucose regulation.

The respiratory issues are caused by lack of clearance of lung fluid or relative deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, or both. Feeding issues are caused by lack of coordination of suck and swallow, which can interfere with bottle feeding and delay successful breast feeding, putting the infant at risk for poor weight gain and dehydration. Related both to feeding issues and immaturity, these infants have an eightfold increased risk of developing a TSB level above 20 mg/dL when com- pared with infants born after 40 completed weeks. As a consequence, late preterm infants are overrepresented in the kernicterus registry. Rehospitalizations due to jaundice, proven or suspected infection, feeding difficulties, and fail- ure to thrive are much more common than in term infants. Late preterm infants should be considered preterm rather than near term and require close in-hospital monitoring after birth for complications. After nursery discharge, close outpatient follow-up is indicated, especially if they are sent home within 48–72 hours after birth. Adamkin DH: Feeding problems in the late preterm infant.

       "      <td>CARDIAC PROBLEMS  IN THE NEWBORN INFANT STRUCTURAL HEART DISEASE 1. Cyanotic Presentations ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  &amp; TYPICAL FEATURES \u0003 Cyanosis, initially without associated respiratory dis- tress. \u0003 Failure to increase PaO2 with supplemental oxygen. \u0003 Chest radiograph with decreased lung markings sug- gests right heart obstruction, while increased lung markings suggest transposition or pulmonary venous obstruction. \u0003 General Considerations The causes of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn are transposition of the great vessels, total anomalous pulmo- nary venous return, truncus arteriosus (some types), tricus- pid atresia, and pulmonary atresia or critical pulmonary stenosis. \u0003 Clinical Findings Infants with these disorders present with early cyanosis. The hallmark of many of these lesions is cyanosis without associ- ated respiratory distress. In most of these infants, tachypnea develops over time either because of increased pulmonary blood flow or secondary to metabolic acidemia from pro- gressive hypoxemia. Diagnostic aids include comparing the blood gas or oxygen saturation in room air to that in 100% FIO2. Failure of PaO2 or SaO2 to increase suggests cyanotic heart disease. Note: A PaO2, if feasible, is the preferred measure. Saturation in the newborn may be misleadingly high despite pathologically low PaO2 due to the left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve seen with fetal hemoglo- bin. Other useful aids are chest radiography, electrocardiog- raphy, and echocardiography. Transposition of the great vessels is the most common form of cyanotic heart disease presenting in the newborn. Examination generally reveals a systolic murmur and single S2. Chest radiograph shows a generous heart size and a narrow mediastinum with normal or increased lung mark- ings. There is little change in PaO2 or SaO2 with supplemental oxygen. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return, in which venous return is obstructed, presents early with severe cyanosis and tachypnea because the pulmonary venous return is obstructed, resulting in pulmonary edema. The chest radiograph typically shows a small to normal heart size with marked pulmonary edema. Infants with right heart obstruction (pulmonary and tricuspid atresia, critical pul- monary stenosis, and some forms of truncus arteriosus) have decreased lung markings on chest radiographs and, depend- ing on the severity of hypoxia, may develop metabolic acidemia. Those lesions with an underdeveloped right heart will have left-sided predominance on electrocardiography. Although tetralogy of Fallot is the most common form of cyanotic heart disease, the obstruction at the pulmonary valve is often not severe enough to result in cyanosis in the newborn. In all cases, diagnosis can be confirmed by echo- cardiography. 2. Acyanotic Presentations ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  &amp; TYPICAL FEATURES \u0003 Most newborns with acyanotic heart disease have left- sided outflow obstruction. \u0003 Differentially diminished pulses (coarctation) or decreased pulses throughout (aortic atresia). \u0003 Metabolic acidemia. \u0002  \u0002 THE NEWBORN INFANT 43 bates pulmonary vasoconstriction. In some cases, a mild respiratory alkalosis may improve oxygenation. Pulmonary vasodilation can be enhanced using inhaled nitric oxide, which is identical or very similar to endogenous endothe- lium-derived relaxing factor, at doses of 5–20 ppm. High- frequency oscillatory ventilation has proved effective in many of these infants, particularly those with severe associated lung disease. Infants for whom conventional therapy is failing (poor oxygenation despite maximum support) may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The lungs are essentially at rest during ECMO, and with resolution of pulmonary hypertension infants are weaned from ECMO back to ventilator therapy. Approximately 10–15% of survi- vors of PPHN have significant neurologic sequelae, with cerebral palsy or cognitive delays. Other sequelae such as chronic lung disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and feeding problems have also been reported. ARRHYTHMIAS Irregularly irregular heart rates, commonly associated with premature atrial contractions and less commonly with pre- mature ventricular contractions, are common in the first days of life in well newborns. These arrhythmias are benign. Clinically significant bradyarrhythmias are seen in associa- tion with congenital heart block. Heart block can be seen in an otherwise structurally normal heart (associated with maternal lupus) or with structural cardiac abnormalities. In the absence of fetal hydrops, the bradyarrhythmia is often well tolerated. Cardiac pacing may be required if there are symptoms of inadequate cardiac output. On ECG, tachyarrhythmias can be either wide complex (ventricular tachycardia) or narrow complex (supraventricu- lar tachycardia). Supraventricular tachycardia is the most common neonatal tachyarrhythmia and may be a sign of structural heart disease, myocarditis, left atrial enlargement, and aberrant conduction pathways. Acute treatment is ice to the face, and if unsuccessful, IV adenosine (50–200 mcg/kg). If there is no response, the dose can be increased to 300 mcg/kg. Long-term therapy is with digoxin or propranolol. Digoxin should not be used in infants with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Cardioversion is rarely needed for supraventricular tachycardia but is needed acutely for hemodynamically unsta- ble ventricular tachycardia. Kothari DS, Skinner JR: Neonatal tachycardias: An update.

       "      <td>METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in serum [HCO3 –] and systemic pH due to the loss of HCO3 – from the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, the addition of an acid (from external sources or via altered metabolic pro- cesses), or the rapid dilution of the ECF with non-bicarbo- nate–containing solution (usually normal saline). When HCO3 – is lost through the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, Cl– must be reabsorbed with Na+ disproportionately, resulting in a hyperchloremic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Thus a normal anion gap acidosis in the absence of diarrhea or other bicarbonate-rich gastrointestinal losses suggests the possibility of renal tubular acidosis and should be evaluated appropri- ately. (See Chapter 22.) In contrast, acidosis that results from addition of an unmeasured acid is associated with a widened anion gap. Examples are diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, starvation, uremia, toxin ingestion (salicylates, ethylene glycol, or methanol), and certain inborn errors of organic or amino acid metabolism. Dehydration may also result in a widened anion gap acidosis as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion, decreased O2 delivery, and subsequent lactic and keto acid pro- duction. Respiratory compensation is accomplished through an increase in minute ventilation and a decrease in PCO2. The patient’s history, physical findings, and laboratory features should lead to the appropriate diagnosis. The ingestion of unknown toxins or the possibility of an inborn error of metabolism (see Chapter 34) must be consid- ered in children without an obvious cause for a widened anion gap acidosis. Unfortunately, some hospital laboratories fail to include ethylene glycol or methanol in their standard toxicol- ogy screens, so that these toxins must be requested specifically. This is of critical importance when therapy with fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole) must be considered for either ingestion— and instituted quickly to head off profound toxicity. Ethylene glycol (eg, antifreeze) is particularly worrisome because of its sweet taste and accounts for a significant number of toxin ingestions. Screening by fluorescence of urine under a Wood’s lamp is relatively simple but does not replace specific labora- tory assessment. Salicylate intoxication has a stimulatory effect on the respiratory center of the CNS; thus patients may initially present with respiratory alkalosis or mixed respiratory alkalosis and widened anion gap acidosis. Most types of metabolic acidosis will resolve with correc- tion of the underlying disorder, improved renal perfusion, and acid excretion. Intravenous NaHCO3 administration may be considered in the setting of metabolic acidosis when the pH is less than 7.0 or the [HCO3 –] is less than 5 mEq/L, but only if adequate ventilation is ensured. The dose (in milliequivalents) of NaHCO3 may be calculated as: and given as a continuous infusion over 1 hour. The effect of NaHCO3 in lowering serum potassium and ionized calcium concentrations must also be considered and monitored. METABOLIC ALKALOSIS Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a primary increase in [HCO3 –] and pH resulting from a loss of strong acid or gain of buffer base. The most common cause for a metabolic alkalosis is the loss of gastric juice via nasogastric suction or vomiting. This results in a Cl–-responsive alkalosis, characterized by a low urinary [Cl–] (&lt; 20 mEq/L) indicative of a volume-contracted state that will be responsive to the provision of adequate Cl– salt (usually in the form of normal saline). Cystic fibrosis may also be associated with a Cl–-responsive alkalosis due to the high losses of NaCl through the sweat, whereas congenital Cl–-losing diarrhea is a rare cause of Cl–-responsive alkalo- sis. Chloride-resistant alkaloses are characterized by a uri- nary [Cl–] greater than 20 mEq/L and include Bartter syndrome, Cushing syndrome, and primary hyperaldoster- onism, conditions associated with primary increases in urinary [Cl–], or volume-expanded states lacking stimuli for Cl– reabsorption. Thus the urinary [Cl–] is helpful in distinguish- ing the nature of a metabolic alkalosis, but must be specifically requested in many laboratories because it is not routinely included in urine electrolyte screens. The serum [K+] is also low in these settings (hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis) owing to a combination of increased mineralocorticoid activity associated with volume contraction, the shift of K+ to the ICF compart- \u0002 Weight kg ( ) Base deficit × 0.3 ×  \u0002 CHAPTER 43 1252 The therapies outlined above provide transient benefits. Ultimately, K+ must be reduced to normal levels by reestab- lishing adequate renal excretion using diuretics or optimiz- ing urinary flow, using ion exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or as a retention enema (0.2–0.5 g/kg orally or 1 g/kg as an enema), or by dialysis. ACID-BASE DISTURBANCES When evaluating a disturbance in acid-base balance, the sys- temic pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2), serum [HCO3 –], and anion gap must be considered. The anion gap, Na+ – (Cl– + HCO3 –), is an expression of the unmeasured anions in the plasma and is normally 12 ± 4 mEq/L. An increase above normal suggests the presence of an unmea- sured anion, such as occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, salicylate intoxication, and so on. Although the base excess (or deficit) is also used clinically, it is important to recall that this expression of acid-base balance is influenced by the renal response to respiratory disorders and cannot be inter- preted independently (as in a compensated respiratory acido- sis, wherein the base excess may be quite large). Recently, there has been greater interest in the Stewart approach to acid-base disturbances and the calculation of the “strong ion differ- ence,” which is beyond the scope of the present discussion. The interested reader is referred to the review by Gunnerson and Kellum listed in the references at the end of this chapter. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in serum [HCO3 –] and systemic pH due to the loss of HCO3 – from the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, the addition of an acid (from external sources or via altered metabolic pro- cesses), or the rapid dilution of the ECF with non-bicarbo- nate–containing solution (usually normal saline).

       "      <td>RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS Respiratory acidosis develops when alveolar ventilation is decreased, increasing PCO2 and lowering systemic pH. The kidneys compensate for respiratory acidosis by increasing HCO3 – reabsorption, a process that takes several days to manifest. Patients with acute respiratory acidoses frequently demonstrate air hunger with retractions and the use of accessory respiratory muscles. Respiratory acidoses occur in upper or lower airway obstruction, ventilation-perfusion disturbances, CNS depression, and neuromuscular defects. Hypercapnia is not as detrimental as the hypoxia that usually accompanies these disorders. The goal of therapy is to correct or compensate for the underlying pathologic process, to improve alveolar ventilation. Bicarbonate therapy is not indicated in a pure respiratory acidosis, because it will worsen the acidosis by shifting the equilibrium of the car- bonic acid–bicarbonate buffer system to increase PCO2. RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS Respiratory alkalosis occurs when hyperventilation results in a decrease in PCO2 and an increase in pH. Patients may experience tingling, paresthesias, dizziness, palpitations, syn- cope, or even tetany and seizures due to the associated decrease in ionized calcium. Causes of respiratory alkalosis include psychobehavioral disturbances, CNS irritation from meningitis or encephalitis, and salicylate intoxication. Ther- apy is directed toward the causal process. Rebreathing into a paper bag will decrease the severity of symptoms in acute hyperventilation. REFERENCES Adrogue JA, Madias NE: Management of life-threatening acid– base disorders: Parts 1 and 2.

Accurso, MD Laboratory tests provide valuable information necessary to evaluate a patient’s condition and to monitor recom- mended treatment. Chemistry and hematology test results are compared with those of healthy individuals or those undergoing similar therapeutic treatment to determine clinical status and progress. In the past, the term normal ranges relayed some ambiguity because statistically, the term normal also implied a specific (gaussian or normal) distribution and epidemiologically it implied the state of the majority, which is not necessarily the desirable or targeted population. This is most apparent in cholesterol levels, where values greater than 200 mg/dL are common, but not desirable. Use of the term reference range or reference interval is therefore recommended by the Interna- tional Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, for- merly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, NCCLS) to indicate that the values relate to a reference population and clinical condition. Reference ranges are established for a specific age (eg, α- fetoprotein), sex, and sexual maturity (eg, luteinizing hor- mone and testosterone); they are also defined for a specific pharmacologic status (eg, taking cyclosporine), dietary restrictions (eg, phenylalanine) and stimulation protocol (eg, growth hormone). Similarly, diurnal variation is a factor (eg, cortisol), as is degree of obesity (eg, insulin). Some reference ranges are particularly meaningful when combined with other results (eg, parathyroid hormone and calcium), or when an entire set of analytes is evaluated (eg, lipid profile: triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein). Laboratory tests are becoming more specific and measure much lower concentrations than ever before. Therefore reference ranges should reflect the analytical procedure, as well as reagents and instrumentation used for a specific analysis. As test methodology continues to evolve, reference ranges are modified and updated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CHALLENGES IN DETERMINING  &amp; INTERPRETING PEDIATRIC REFERENCE INTERVALS The pediatric environment is particularly challenging for the determination of reference intervals since growth and devel- opmental stages do not have a distinct and finite boundary by which test results can be tabulated. Reference ranges may overlap and, in many cases, complicate diagnosis and treat- ment. Collection and allocation of test results by age for the purpose of establishing a reference range is a convenient and manageable way to report them, but caution is needed in their interpretation and clinical correlation. A particular difficulty lies in establishing reference ranges for analytes whose levels are changed under scheduled stim- ulation conditions. The common glucose tolerance test is such an example, but more complex endocrinology tests (eg, stimulation by clonidine and cosyntropin) require skill and extensive experience to interpret. Reference ranges for these serial tests are established over a long period of time and are not easily transferable between test methodologies. Chang- ing analytical technologies adds a new dimension to the challenges of establishing pediatric reference ranges. GUIDELINES FOR USE OF DATA  IN A REFERENCE RANGE STUDY The College of American Pathologists provides guidelines for the adoption of reference ranges used in hospitals and commercial clinical laboratories. It recognizes the enormous task of establishing a laboratory’s own reference ranges, and recommends alternatives to the process. A laboratory may acquire reference ranges by: 1. Conducting its own study to evaluate a statistically significant number of “healthy” volunteers. It is a mon- umental task for a laboratory to develop its own pediat- ric reference ranges, because parental consent and Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

A histogram depicting the nongaussian distribution of data from a free thyroxine reference range study conducted at Children’s Hospital in Denver is shown in Figure 44–2. WHY REFERENCE INTERVALS VARY Recent modifications to reference ranges are due to the introduction of new and improved analytical procedures, advanced automated instrumentation, and standardization of reagents and reference materials. Reference ranges are also affected by preanalytical variations that can occur during sample collection, processing, and storage. Preanalytical variations of biological origin can occur when specimens are drawn in the morning versus in the evening, or from hospitalized recumbent patients versus ambulatory outpatients. Variations may also be caused by metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Preanalytical factors may be a product of the socioeconomic environment or ethnic background (eg, genetic or dietary). Analytical variations are caused by differences in analyt- ical measurements and depend on the analytical tools as well as an inherent variability in obtaining a quantitative value. Furthermore, scientific progress is constantly introducing new reagents, instruments, and improved testing procedures to the clinical laboratory, and each tool adds an element of variability between tests. 1. Antigen-antibody reactions have revolutionized clinical chemistry, but have also added a degree of variability because biologically derived reagents have different specificity and sensitivity. In addition to the targeted analyte, some of its metabolites are also measured, and these may or may not be biologically active. 2. Reference materials continue to be reviewed and evalu- ated by organizations such as the World Health Organi- zation and the National Institute for Standards and Technology. A new standard was recently established for troponin I, and reference ranges were modified to reflect the new standard. 3. Analytical instrumentation with advanced electronics and robotics has improved accuracy of results and increased throughput. However, they have added an element of variability between instruments from differ- ent manufacturers. 4. Analytical detection methods have also made big strides as they have expanded from simple ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry, to fluorescence, nephelometry, radio- immunoassay, and chemiluminescence. For example, the third-generation thyroid-stimulating hormone assays can now measure concentrations as low as 0.001 μIU/mL, and the reference range was recently modified to reflect the improved sensitivity of the assay.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SENSITIVITY &amp; SPECIFICITY Despite its statistical derivation, a reference interval does not necessarily provide a finite and clear-cut guideline as to whether a patient has a disease. There will always be a segment of the population with test values that fall within the reference interval, but clinical manifestations that indi- cate disease is present. Similarly, a segment of the popula- tion will have test values outside the reference interval, but no clinical signs of disease. The ability of a test and corresponding reference interval to detect individuals with disease is defined by the diagnostic sensitivity of the test. Similarly, the ability of a test to detect individuals without disease is described by the diagnostic specificity. These characteristics are governed by the analytical quality of the test, as well as the numerical parameters (reference inter- val) that define the presence of disease. The tolerance level for the desired sensitivity and specificity of a test requires significant input from clinicians. Generally, specificity increases as sensitivity decreases. A typical reference range frequency distribution, shown in Figure 44–3 (solid line), provides information on the test results of a number of healthy subjects, or individuals without the disease. A second curve (dashed line) shows test results for individuals with the disease. As with most tests, there is an overlap area. A patient with a test result of 1 is likely healthy, and the result indicates a true negative (TN) for the presence of disease. A patient with a test result of 9 is likely to have the disease and the test result is a true positive (TP).There is a small, but significant population with a test result of 2–5 in whom the test is not 100% conclusive. A statistical analysis may determine the most likely cutoff for healthy individuals, but the clinically acceptable cutoff depends on the test as well as clinical correlation. Where the treatment is aggressive and has serious side effects, a clinician may choose to err on the side of caution and hold treatment for anyone with a test value of less than 6. ▲ Figure 44–2.

The mother’s medical history includes chronic medical conditions, medications taken during pregnancy, unusual dietary habits, smoking history, occupational exposure to chemicals or infections of potential risk to the fetus, and any social history that might increase the risk for parenting prob- lems and child abuse. Family illnesses with genetic implica- tions should be sought. The past obstetric history includes maternal age, gravidity, parity, blood type, and pregnancy outcomes. The current obstetric history includes the results of procedures during the current pregnancy such as ultrasound, amniocentesis, screening tests (rubella antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, serum quadruple screen for genetic disorders, HIV), and antepartum tests of fetal well-being (eg, biophysical profiles, nonstress tests, or Doppler assessment of fetal blood flow patterns). Pregnancy-related maternal complications such as urinary tract infection, pregnancy-induced hyperten- sion, eclampsia, gestational diabetes, vaginal bleeding, and preterm labor should be documented. Significant peripartum events include duration of ruptured membranes, maternal fever, fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), anesthesia and analgesia used, reason for operative or forceps delivery, infant status at birth, resuscitative measures, and Apgar scores. ASSESSMENT OF GROWTH  & GESTATIONAL AGE It is important to know the infant’s gestational age because normal behavior and possible medical problems can be predicted on this basis. The date of the last menstrual period is the best indicator of gestational age. Uterine fundal height and early fetal ultrasound provide supporting information. Postnatal physical characteristics and neurologic develop- ment are also clues to gestational age. Table 1–1 lists the physical and neurologic criteria of maturity used to estimate gestational age by the Ballard score method. Adding the scores assigned to each neonatal physical and neuromuscular sign yields a score corresponding to gestational age. Disappearance of the anterior vascular capsule of the lens is also helpful in determining gestational age. Until 27–28 weeks’ gestation, the lens capsule is covered by vessels; by 34 weeks, this vascular plexus is completely atrophied. Foot length, from the heel to the tip of the longest toe, also correlates with gestational age in appropriately grown infants. The foot measures 4.5 cm at 25 weeks’ gestation and increases 0.25 cm per week until term. If the physical examination indicates a gestational age within 2 weeks of that predicted by the obstetric dates, the gestational age is as assigned by the obstetric date. Birth weight and gestational age are plotted on standard grids (Figure 1–1) to determine whether the birth weight is appropriate for gestational age (AGA), small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA). Another term for SGA is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Birth weight for gestational age in normal neonates varies with \u0002 Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Assess the character of the cry; a high-pitched cry may indicate disease of the central nervous system (CNS) such as hemorrhage. Hypotonia and a weak cry may indicate systemic disease or congenital neuromuscular disorder. Check the following newborn reflexes: 1. Sucking reflex in response to a nipple or the examiner’s finger in the mouth. This reflex is observed by 14 weeks’ gestation. 2. Rooting reflex: Head turns to the side of a facial stimu- lus. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation. 3. Traction response: The infant is pulled by the arms to a sitting position. Initially, the head lags, then with active flexion, comes to the midline briefly before falling forward. 4. Palmar grasp with placement of the examiner’s finger in the palm. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation and disappears by age 4 months. 5. Deep tendon reflexes: Several beats of ankle clonus and an upgoing Babinski reflex may be normal. 6. Moro (startle) reflex: Hold the infant supine while sup- porting the head. Allow the head to drop 1–2 cm suddenly. The arms will abduct at the shoulder and extend at the elbow with spreading of the fingers. Adduction with flexion will follow. This reflex develops by 28 weeks’ gestation (incomplete) and disappears by age 3 months. 7. Tonic neck reflex: Forcibly turn the infant’s head to one side; the arm and leg on that side will extend while the opposite arm and leg flex (“fencing position”). This reflex disappears by age 8 months. Adam M, Hudgins L: The importance of minor anomalies in the evaluation of the newborn. NeoReviews 2003;4:e99.

Staff must monitor infants for signs and symptoms of illness, including temperature instability, change in activ- ity, refusal to feed, pallor, cyanosis, early or excessive jaundice, tachypnea, respiratory distress, delayed (beyond 24 hours) first stool or first void, and bilious vomiting. Several preventive measures are routine in the normal newborn nursery. Prophylactic erythromycin ointment is applied to the eyes within 1 hour of birth to prevent gonococcal oph- thalmia. Vitamin K (1 mg) is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously within 4 hours of birth to prevent hemor- rhagic disease of the newborn. All infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine. Both hepa- titis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) are administered if the mother is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). If maternal HBsAg status is unknown, vaccine should be given, maternal blood should be tested for HBsAg, and HBIG should be given to the neonate before 7 days of age if the test is positive. Cord blood is collected from all infants at birth and used for blood typing and Coombs testing if the mother is type O or Rh-negative. Rapid glucose testing should be performed in infants at risk for hypoglycemia (infants of diabetic mothers, preterm, SGA, LGA, or stressed infants). Values below 45 mg/dL should be confirmed by laboratory blood glucose testing and treated. Hematocrit should be measured at age 3–6 hours in infants at risk for or those who have symptoms of polycythe- mia or anemia. State-sponsored newborn genetic screens (for inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria [PKU], galac- tosemia, sickle cell disease, hypothyroidism, and cystic fibro- sis) are performed prior to discharge, after 24–48 hours of age if possible. In many states, a repeat test is required at 8– 14 days of age because the PKU test may be falsely negative when obtained before 48 hours of age. Not all state-man- dated screens include the same panel of diseases. The most recent addition in some states is a screen for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In infants with prolonged postpartum hospitalization, genetic screening should be performed by 1 week of age. In addition to the state-mandated screen, some centers offer expanded newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry to look for other inborn errors such as fatty acid oxidation defects. Infants should routinely be positioned supine to mini- mize the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Prone positioning is contraindicated unless there are com- pelling clinical reasons for that position. Bed sharing with adults and prone positioning are associated with increased risk of SIDS. FEEDING THE WELL NEONATE A neonate is ready for feeding if he or she is (1) alert and vigorous, (2) has no abdominal distention, (3) has good bowel sounds, and (4) has a normal hunger cry. These signs usually occur within 6 hours after birth, but fetal distress or traumatic delivery may prolong this period. The healthy full- term infant should be allowed to feed every 2–5 hours on demand. The first breast feeding may occur in the delivery room. For formula-fed infants, the first feeding usually occurs by 3 hours of life. The feeding volume generally increases from 0.5–1 oz per feeding initially to 1.5–2 oz per feeding on day 3. By day 3, the average full-term newborn takes about 100 mL/kg/d of milk. A wide range of infant formulas satisfy the nutritional needs of most neonates. Breast milk is the standard on which \u0002  \u0002 CHAPTER 1 10 evoked otoacoustic emissions as early as possible because up to 40% of hearing loss will be missed by risk analysis alone. Primary care providers and parents should be advised of the possibility of hearing loss and offered immediate referral in suspect cases. With the use of universal screening, the aver- age age at which hearing loss is confirmed has dropped from 24–30 months to 2–3 months. If remediation is begun by 6 months, language and social development are commensu- rate with physical development.

The normal newborn is deficient in antioxidants such as vitamin E, catalase, and superoxide dis- mutase. Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and peroxyl scaven- ger and may protect the newborn from oxygen toxicity in the first days of life. Approximately 8–10% of newborns develop excessive hyperbilirubinemia (TSB > 17 mg/dL), and 1–2% have TSB above 20 mg/dL. Extremely high and potentially dangerous TSB levels are rare. Approximately 1 in 700 infants have TSB higher than 25 mg/dL, and 1 in 10,000 have TSB above 30 mg/dL. Such high levels can cause kernicterus, characterized by injury to the basal ganglia and brainstem. Kernicterus caused by hyperbilirubinemia was common in neonates with Rh-isoimmunization until the institution of exchange transfusion for affected infants and postpar- tum high-titer Rho (D) immune globulin treatment for sensitized mothers. For several decades after the introduc- tion of exchange transfusion and phototherapy aimed at keeping the neonate’s TSB below 20 mg/dL, there were no reported cases of kernicterus in the United States. Since the early 1990s, however, there has been a reappearance of kernicterus, with more than 120 cases reported to a volun- tary registry. Common factors in the recent cases are newborn discharge before 48 hours (all but one), breast feeding (100%), delayed measurement of TSB, unrecog- nized hemolysis, lack of early postdischarge follow-up, and failure to recognize the early symptoms of encephalopathy. Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of heme (iron protoporphyrin) in the reticuloendothelial system and bone marrow. Heme is cleaved by heme oxygenase to iron, which is conserved; carbon monoxide, which is exhaled; and biliverdin, which is converted to bilirubin by bilirubin reductase. Each gram of hemoglobin yields 34 mg of biliru- bin (1 mg/dL = 17.2 mmol/L of bilirubin). This unconju- gated bilirubin is bound to albumin and carried to the liver, where it is taken up by hepatocytes. In the presence of the uridyldiphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT; glucuro- nyl transferase), bilirubin is conjugated to one or two glucu- Table 1–5. Contraindications  to early newborn discharge.

Twinning historically occurred at a rate of 1 in 80 pregnan- cies (1.25%). The incidence of twinning and higher-order multiple births in the United States has increased because of in-vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive tech- nologies. In 2002, twins occurred in 1 in 32 live births in the United States, with multiple births accounting for 3.3% of all births. A distinction should be made between dizygous (frater- nal) and monozygous (identical) twins. Race, maternal par- ity, and maternal age affect the incidence of dizygous, but not monozygous, twinning. Drugs used to induce ovulation, such as clomiphene citrate and gonadotropins, increase the incidence of dizygotic or polyzygotic twinning. Monozygous twinning also seems to be more common after assisted reproduction. The incidence of malformations is also increased in identical twins and may affect only one of the twins. If a defect is found in one twin, the other should be examined carefully for lesser degrees of the same defect. Early transvaginal ultrasound and examination of the placenta after birth can help establish the type of twinning: Two amnionic membranes and two chorionic membranes are found in all dizygous twins and in one third of monozy- gous twins even when the placental disks appear to be fused into one. A single chorionic membrane always indicates monozygous twins. The rare monochorial, monoamniotic situation (1% of twins) is especially dangerous, with a high risk of antenatal cord entanglement and death of one or both twins. Close fetal surveillance is indicated. \u0003 Complications of Multiple Births A. Intrauterine Growth Restriction There is some degree of IUGR in most multiple pregnancies, especially after 32 weeks, although it is usually not clinically significant with two exceptions. First, in monochorial twin pregnancy an arteriovenous shunt may develop between the twins (twin-twin transfusion syndrome). The twin on the venous side (recipient) becomes plethoric and larger than the smaller anemic twin (donor), who may ultimately die or be severely growth restricted. The occurrence of polyhy- dramnios in the larger twin and oligohydramnios in the smaller may be the first sign of this problem. Second, discordance in size (birth weights that are significantly dif- ferent) can also occur when separate placentas are present if one placenta develops poorly, because of a poor implanta- tion site. In this instance, no fetal exchange of blood takes place but the growth rates of the two infants are different. B. Preterm Delivery Length of gestation tends to be inversely related to the number of fetuses. The mean age at delivery for singletons is 38.8 weeks, for twins 35.3 weeks, for triplets 32.2 weeks, and for quadruplets 29.9 weeks. The prematurity rate in multiple gestations is 5–10 times that of singletons, with 50% of twins and 90% of triplets born before 37 weeks. There is an increased incidence of cerebral palsy in multiple births, more so with monochorial than dichorial infants. Prematurity is the main cause of increased mortality and morbidity in twins, although in the case of monochorial twins, intravascular exchange through placental anastomoses, particularly after the death of one twin, also increases the risk substantially. C. Obstetric Complications Polyhydramnios, pregnancy-induced hypertension, prema- ture rupture of membranes, abnormal fetal presentations, and prolapsed umbilical cord occur more frequently in women with multiple fetuses. Multiple pregnancy should always be identified prenatally with ultrasound examina- tions; doing so allows the obstetrician and pediatrician or neonatologist to plan management jointly. Because neonatal complications are usually related to prematurity, prolonga- tion of pregnancy significantly reduces neonatal morbidity.

refers to the steps taken by the obstetri- cian to support the infant during labor and delivery and the resuscitative steps taken by the pediatrician after delivery. Intrapartum support includes maintaining maternal blood pressure, maternal oxygen therapy, positioning the mother to improve placental perfusion, readjusting oxytocin infusions or administering a tocolytic if appropriate, minimizing trauma to the infant, obtaining all necessary cord blood samples, and completing an examination of the placenta. The pediatrician or neonatologist focuses on temperature support, initiation and maintenance of effective ventilation, maintenance of per- fusion and hydration, and glucose regulation. A number of conditions associated with pregnancy, labor, and delivery place the infant at risk for birth \u0002  \u0002 THE NEWBORN INFANT 41 ing problems, and rehospitalization after hospital discharge. The respiratory issues are caused by lack of clearance of lung fluid or relative deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, or both. Feeding issues are caused by lack of coordination of suck and swallow, which can interfere with bottle feeding and delay successful breast feeding, putting the infant at risk for poor weight gain and dehydration. Related both to feeding issues and immaturity, these infants have an eightfold increased risk of developing a TSB level above 20 mg/dL when com- pared with infants born after 40 completed weeks. As a consequence, late preterm infants are overrepresented in the kernicterus registry. Rehospitalizations due to jaundice, proven or suspected infection, feeding difficulties, and fail- ure to thrive are much more common than in term infants. Late preterm infants should be considered preterm rather than near term and require close in-hospital monitoring after birth for complications. After nursery discharge, close outpatient follow-up is indicated, especially if they are sent home within 48–72 hours after birth. Adamkin DH: Feeding problems in the late preterm infant.

Cyanotic Presentations ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES \u0003 Cyanosis, initially without associated respiratory dis- tress. \u0003 Failure to increase PaO2 with supplemental oxygen. \u0003 Chest radiograph with decreased lung markings sug- gests right heart obstruction, while increased lung markings suggest transposition or pulmonary venous obstruction. \u0003 General Considerations The causes of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn are transposition of the great vessels, total anomalous pulmo- nary venous return, truncus arteriosus (some types), tricus- pid atresia, and pulmonary atresia or critical pulmonary stenosis. \u0003 Clinical Findings Infants with these disorders present with early cyanosis. The hallmark of many of these lesions is cyanosis without associ- ated respiratory distress. In most of these infants, tachypnea develops over time either because of increased pulmonary blood flow or secondary to metabolic acidemia from pro- gressive hypoxemia. Diagnostic aids include comparing the blood gas or oxygen saturation in room air to that in 100% FIO2. Failure of PaO2 or SaO2 to increase suggests cyanotic heart disease. Note: A PaO2, if feasible, is the preferred measure. Saturation in the newborn may be misleadingly high despite pathologically low PaO2 due to the left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve seen with fetal hemoglo- bin. Other useful aids are chest radiography, electrocardiog- raphy, and echocardiography. Transposition of the great vessels is the most common form of cyanotic heart disease presenting in the newborn. Examination generally reveals a systolic murmur and single S2. Chest radiograph shows a generous heart size and a narrow mediastinum with normal or increased lung mark- ings. There is little change in PaO2 or SaO2 with supplemental oxygen. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return, in which venous return is obstructed, presents early with severe cyanosis and tachypnea because the pulmonary venous return is obstructed, resulting in pulmonary edema. The chest radiograph typically shows a small to normal heart size with marked pulmonary edema. Infants with right heart obstruction (pulmonary and tricuspid atresia, critical pul- monary stenosis, and some forms of truncus arteriosus) have decreased lung markings on chest radiographs and, depend- ing on the severity of hypoxia, may develop metabolic acidemia. Those lesions with an underdeveloped right heart will have left-sided predominance on electrocardiography. Although tetralogy of Fallot is the most common form of cyanotic heart disease, the obstruction at the pulmonary valve is often not severe enough to result in cyanosis in the newborn. In all cases, diagnosis can be confirmed by echo- cardiography. 2. Acyanotic Presentations ESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS  & TYPICAL FEATURES \u0003 Most newborns with acyanotic heart disease have left- sided outflow obstruction. \u0003 Differentially diminished pulses (coarctation) or decreased pulses throughout (aortic atresia). \u0003 Metabolic acidemia. \u0002  \u0002 THE NEWBORN INFANT 43 bates pulmonary vasoconstriction. In some cases, a mild respiratory alkalosis may improve oxygenation. Pulmonary vasodilation can be enhanced using inhaled nitric oxide, which is identical or very similar to endogenous endothe- lium-derived relaxing factor, at doses of 5–20 ppm. High- frequency oscillatory ventilation has proved effective in many of these infants, particularly those with severe associated lung disease. Infants for whom conventional therapy is failing (poor oxygenation despite maximum support) may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The lungs are essentially at rest during ECMO, and with resolution of pulmonary hypertension infants are weaned from ECMO back to ventilator therapy. Approximately 10–15% of survi- vors of PPHN have significant neurologic sequelae, with cerebral palsy or cognitive delays. Other sequelae such as chronic lung disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and feeding problems have also been reported. ARRHYTHMIAS Irregularly irregular heart rates, commonly associated with premature atrial contractions and less commonly with pre- mature ventricular contractions, are common in the first days of life in well newborns. These arrhythmias are benign. Clinically significant bradyarrhythmias are seen in associa- tion with congenital heart block. Heart block can be seen in an otherwise structurally normal heart (associated with maternal lupus) or with structural cardiac abnormalities. In the absence of fetal hydrops, the bradyarrhythmia is often well tolerated. Cardiac pacing may be required if there are symptoms of inadequate cardiac output. On ECG, tachyarrhythmias can be either wide complex (ventricular tachycardia) or narrow complex (supraventricu- lar tachycardia). Supraventricular tachycardia is the most common neonatal tachyarrhythmia and may be a sign of structural heart disease, myocarditis, left atrial enlargement, and aberrant conduction pathways. Acute treatment is ice to the face, and if unsuccessful, IV adenosine (50–200 mcg/kg). If there is no response, the dose can be increased to 300 mcg/kg. Long-term therapy is with digoxin or propranolol. Digoxin should not be used in infants with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Cardioversion is rarely needed for supraventricular tachycardia but is needed acutely for hemodynamically unsta- ble ventricular tachycardia. Kothari DS, Skinner JR: Neonatal tachycardias: An update.

       "478  METABOLIC ACIDOSIS Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in serum [HCO3 –] and systemic pH due to the loss of HCO3 – from the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, the addition of an acid (from external sources or via altered metabolic pro- cesses), or the rapid dilution of the ECF with non-bicarbo- nate–containing solution (usually normal saline). When HCO3 – is lost through the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, Cl– must be reabsorbed with Na+ disproportionately, resulting in a hyperchloremic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Thus a normal anion gap acidosis in the absence of diarrhea or other bicarbonate-rich gastrointestinal losses suggests the possibility of renal tubular acidosis and should be evaluated appropri- ately. (See Chapter 22.) In contrast, acidosis that results from addition of an unmeasured acid is associated with a widened anion gap. Examples are diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, starvation, uremia, toxin ingestion (salicylates, ethylene glycol, or methanol), and certain inborn errors of organic or amino acid metabolism. Dehydration may also result in a widened anion gap acidosis as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion, decreased O2 delivery, and subsequent lactic and keto acid pro- duction. Respiratory compensation is accomplished through an increase in minute ventilation and a decrease in PCO2. The patient’s history, physical findings, and laboratory features should lead to the appropriate diagnosis. The ingestion of unknown toxins or the possibility of an inborn error of metabolism (see Chapter 34) must be consid- ered in children without an obvious cause for a widened anion gap acidosis. Unfortunately, some hospital laboratories fail to include ethylene glycol or methanol in their standard toxicol- ogy screens, so that these toxins must be requested specifically. This is of critical importance when therapy with fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole) must be considered for either ingestion— and instituted quickly to head off profound toxicity. Ethylene glycol (eg, antifreeze) is particularly worrisome because of its sweet taste and accounts for a significant number of toxin ingestions. Screening by fluorescence of urine under a Wood’s lamp is relatively simple but does not replace specific labora- tory assessment. Salicylate intoxication has a stimulatory effect on the respiratory center of the CNS; thus patients may initially present with respiratory alkalosis or mixed respiratory alkalosis and widened anion gap acidosis. Most types of metabolic acidosis will resolve with correc- tion of the underlying disorder, improved renal perfusion, and acid excretion. Intravenous NaHCO3 administration may be considered in the setting of metabolic acidosis when the pH is less than 7.0 or the [HCO3 –] is less than 5 mEq/L, but only if adequate ventilation is ensured. The dose (in milliequivalents) of NaHCO3 may be calculated as: and given as a continuous infusion over 1 hour. The effect of NaHCO3 in lowering serum potassium and ionized calcium concentrations must also be considered and monitored. METABOLIC ALKALOSIS Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a primary increase in [HCO3 –] and pH resulting from a loss of strong acid or gain of buffer base. The most common cause for a metabolic alkalosis is the loss of gastric juice via nasogastric suction or vomiting. This results in a Cl–-responsive alkalosis, characterized by a low urinary [Cl–] (< 20 mEq/L) indicative of a volume-contracted state that will be responsive to the provision of adequate Cl– salt (usually in the form of normal saline). Cystic fibrosis may also be associated with a Cl–-responsive alkalosis due to the high losses of NaCl through the sweat, whereas congenital Cl–-losing diarrhea is a rare cause of Cl–-responsive alkalo- sis. Chloride-resistant alkaloses are characterized by a uri- nary [Cl–] greater than 20 mEq/L and include Bartter syndrome, Cushing syndrome, and primary hyperaldoster- onism, conditions associated with primary increases in urinary [Cl–], or volume-expanded states lacking stimuli for Cl– reabsorption. Thus the urinary [Cl–] is helpful in distinguish- ing the nature of a metabolic alkalosis, but must be specifically requested in many laboratories because it is not routinely included in urine electrolyte screens. The serum [K+] is also low in these settings (hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis) owing to a combination of increased mineralocorticoid activity associated with volume contraction, the shift of K+ to the ICF compart- \u0002 Weight kg ( ) Base deficit × 0.3 ×  \u0002 CHAPTER 43 1252 The therapies outlined above provide transient benefits. Ultimately, K+ must be reduced to normal levels by reestab- lishing adequate renal excretion using diuretics or optimiz- ing urinary flow, using ion exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or as a retention enema (0.2–0.5 g/kg orally or 1 g/kg as an enema), or by dialysis. ACID-BASE DISTURBANCES When evaluating a disturbance in acid-base balance, the sys- temic pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2), serum [HCO3 –], and anion gap must be considered. The anion gap, Na+ – (Cl– + HCO3 –), is an expression of the unmeasured anions in the plasma and is normally 12 ± 4 mEq/L. An increase above normal suggests the presence of an unmea- sured anion, such as occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, salicylate intoxication, and so on. Although the base excess (or deficit) is also used clinically, it is important to recall that this expression of acid-base balance is influenced by the renal response to respiratory disorders and cannot be inter- preted independently (as in a compensated respiratory acido- sis, wherein the base excess may be quite large). Recently, there has been greater interest in the Stewart approach to acid-base disturbances and the calculation of the “strong ion differ- ence,” which is beyond the scope of the present discussion. The interested reader is referred to the review by Gunnerson and Kellum listed in the references at the end of this chapter.

The effect of NaHCO3 in lowering serum potassium and ionized calcium concentrations must also be considered and monitored.   \n",

                                         METABOLIC ALKALOSIS Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a primary increase in [HCO3 –] and pH resulting from a loss of strong acid or gain of buffer base. The most common cause for a metabolic alkalosis is the loss of gastric juice via nasogastric suction or vomiting. This results in a Cl–-responsive alkalosis, characterized by a low urinary [Cl–] (< 20 mEq/L) indicative of a volume-contracted state that will be responsive to the provision of adequate Cl– salt (usually in the form of normal saline). Cystic fibrosis may also be associated with a Cl–-responsive alkalosis due to the high losses of NaCl through the sweat, whereas congenital Cl–-losing diarrhea is a rare cause of Cl–-responsive alkalo- sis. Chloride-resistant alkaloses are characterized by a uri- nary [Cl–] greater than 20 mEq/L and include Bartter syndrome, Cushing syndrome, and primary hyperaldoster- onism, conditions associated with primary increases in urinary [Cl–], or volume-expanded states lacking stimuli for Cl– reabsorption. Thus the urinary [Cl–] is helpful in distinguish- ing the nature of a metabolic alkalosis, but must be specifically requested in many laboratories because it is not routinely included in urine electrolyte screens. The serum [K+] is also low in these settings (hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis) owing to a combination of increased mineralocorticoid activity associated with volume contraction, the shift of K+ to the ICF compart- \u0002 Weight kg ( ) Base deficit × 0.3 ×  \u0002 FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, & ACID-BASE DISORDERS & THERAPY 1253 ment, preferential reabsorption of Na+ rather than K+ to preserve intravascular volume, or primary mineralocorticoid excess.   \n",

The kidneys compensate for respiratory acidosis by increasing HCO3 – reabsorption, a process that takes several days to manifest. Patients with acute respiratory acidoses frequently demonstrate air hunger with retractions and the use of accessory respiratory muscles. Respiratory acidoses occur in upper or lower airway obstruction, ventilation-perfusion disturbances, CNS depression, and neuromuscular defects. Hypercapnia is not as detrimental as the hypoxia that usually accompanies these disorders. The goal of therapy is to correct or compensate for the underlying pathologic process, to improve alveolar ventilation. Bicarbonate therapy is not indicated in a pure respiratory acidosis, because it will worsen the acidosis by shifting the equilibrium of the car- bonic acid–bicarbonate buffer system to increase PCO2. RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS Respiratory alkalosis occurs when hyperventilation results in a decrease in PCO2 and an increase in pH. Patients may experience tingling, paresthesias, dizziness, palpitations, syn- cope, or even tetany and seizures due to the associated decrease in ionized calcium. Causes of respiratory alkalosis include psychobehavioral disturbances, CNS irritation from meningitis or encephalitis, and salicylate intoxication. Ther- apy is directed toward the causal process. Rebreathing into a paper bag will decrease the severity of symptoms in acute hyperventilation. REFERENCES Adrogue JA, Madias NE: Management of life-threatening acid– base disorders: Parts 1 and 2.

Accurso, MD Laboratory tests provide valuable information necessary to evaluate a patient’s condition and to monitor recom- mended treatment. Chemistry and hematology test results are compared with those of healthy individuals or those undergoing similar therapeutic treatment to determine clinical status and progress. In the past, the term normal ranges relayed some ambiguity because statistically, the term normal also implied a specific (gaussian or normal) distribution and epidemiologically it implied the state of the majority, which is not necessarily the desirable or targeted population. This is most apparent in cholesterol levels, where values greater than 200 mg/dL are common, but not desirable. Use of the term reference range or reference interval is therefore recommended by the Interna- tional Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, for- merly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, NCCLS) to indicate that the values relate to a reference population and clinical condition. Reference ranges are established for a specific age (eg, α- fetoprotein), sex, and sexual maturity (eg, luteinizing hor- mone and testosterone); they are also defined for a specific pharmacologic status (eg, taking cyclosporine), dietary restrictions (eg, phenylalanine) and stimulation protocol (eg, growth hormone). Similarly, diurnal variation is a factor (eg, cortisol), as is degree of obesity (eg, insulin). Some reference ranges are particularly meaningful when combined with other results (eg, parathyroid hormone and calcium), or when an entire set of analytes is evaluated (eg, lipid profile: triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein). Laboratory tests are becoming more specific and measure much lower concentrations than ever before. Therefore reference ranges should reflect the analytical procedure, as well as reagents and instrumentation used for a specific analysis. As test methodology continues to evolve, reference ranges are modified and updated.   \n",

Reference ranges may overlap and, in many cases, complicate diagnosis and treat- ment. Collection and allocation of test results by age for the purpose of establishing a reference range is a convenient and manageable way to report them, but caution is needed in their interpretation and clinical correlation. A particular difficulty lies in establishing reference ranges for analytes whose levels are changed under scheduled stim- ulation conditions. The common glucose tolerance test is such an example, but more complex endocrinology tests (eg, stimulation by clonidine and cosyntropin) require skill and extensive experience to interpret. Reference ranges for these serial tests are established over a long period of time and are not easily transferable between test methodologies. Chang- ing analytical technologies adds a new dimension to the challenges of establishing pediatric reference ranges. GUIDELINES FOR USE OF DATA  IN A REFERENCE RANGE STUDY The College of American Pathologists provides guidelines for the adoption of reference ranges used in hospitals and commercial clinical laboratories. It recognizes the enormous task of establishing a laboratory’s own reference ranges, and recommends alternatives to the process. A laboratory may acquire reference ranges by: 1. Conducting its own study to evaluate a statistically significant number of “healthy” volunteers. It is a mon- umental task for a laboratory to develop its own pediat- ric reference ranges, because parental consent and Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

A histogram depicting the nongaussian distribution of data from a free thyroxine reference range study conducted at Children’s Hospital in Denver is shown in Figure 44–2. WHY REFERENCE INTERVALS VARY Recent modifications to reference ranges are due to the introduction of new and improved analytical procedures, advanced automated instrumentation, and standardization of reagents and reference materials. Reference ranges are also affected by preanalytical variations that can occur during sample collection, processing, and storage. Preanalytical variations of biological origin can occur when specimens are drawn in the morning versus in the evening, or from hospitalized recumbent patients versus ambulatory outpatients. Variations may also be caused by metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Preanalytical factors may be a product of the socioeconomic environment or ethnic background (eg, genetic or dietary). Analytical variations are caused by differences in analyt- ical measurements and depend on the analytical tools as well as an inherent variability in obtaining a quantitative value. Furthermore, scientific progress is constantly introducing new reagents, instruments, and improved testing procedures to the clinical laboratory, and each tool adds an element of variability between tests. 1. Antigen-antibody reactions have revolutionized clinical chemistry, but have also added a degree of variability because biologically derived reagents have different specificity and sensitivity. In addition to the targeted analyte, some of its metabolites are also measured, and these may or may not be biologically active. 2. Reference materials continue to be reviewed and evalu- ated by organizations such as the World Health Organi- zation and the National Institute for Standards and Technology. A new standard was recently established for troponin I, and reference ranges were modified to reflect the new standard. 3. Analytical instrumentation with advanced electronics and robotics has improved accuracy of results and increased throughput. However, they have added an element of variability between instruments from differ- ent manufacturers. 4. Analytical detection methods have also made big strides as they have expanded from simple ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry, to fluorescence, nephelometry, radio- immunoassay, and chemiluminescence. For example, the third-generation thyroid-stimulating hormone assays can now measure concentrations as low as 0.001 μIU/mL, and the reference range was recently modified to reflect the improved sensitivity of the assay.   \n",

& SPECIFICITY Despite its statistical derivation, a reference interval does not necessarily provide a finite and clear-cut guideline as to whether a patient has a disease. There will always be a segment of the population with test values that fall within the reference interval, but clinical manifestations that indi- cate disease is present. Similarly, a segment of the popula- tion will have test values outside the reference interval, but no clinical signs of disease. The ability of a test and corresponding reference interval to detect individuals with disease is defined by the diagnostic sensitivity of the test. Similarly, the ability of a test to detect individuals without disease is described by the diagnostic specificity. These characteristics are governed by the analytical quality of the test, as well as the numerical parameters (reference inter- val) that define the presence of disease. The tolerance level for the desired sensitivity and specificity of a test requires significant input from clinicians. Generally, specificity increases as sensitivity decreases. A typical reference range frequency distribution, shown in Figure 44–3 (solid line), provides information on the test results of a number of healthy subjects, or individuals without the disease. A second curve (dashed line) shows test results for individuals with the disease. As with most tests, there is an overlap area. A patient with a test result of 1 is likely healthy, and the result indicates a true negative (TN) for the presence of disease. A patient with a test result of 9 is likely to have the disease and the test result is a true positive (TP).There is a small, but significant population with a test result of 2–5 in whom the test is not 100% conclusive. A statistical analysis may determine the most likely cutoff for healthy individuals, but the clinically acceptable cutoff depends on the test as well as clinical correlation. Where the treatment is aggressive and has serious side effects, a clinician may choose to err on the side of caution and hold treatment for anyone with a test value of less than 6. ▲ Figure 44–2.
